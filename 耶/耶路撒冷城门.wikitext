<!-- ''Note: The links after the gate names link to photos of the gates''

The first of each of the alternate names is the Hebrew version of the name. Other alternate names are traditional Arabic, Christian, or Jewish names.

Next to Jaffa Gate is a gap in the wall, originally a filled-in moat, which is the main route into the Old City and is usually called "the Jaffa Gate." There is also another opening next to the Dung Gate, and the original Roman gates (one large gate flanked by a small gate on each side) can be seen below street level at the Damascus Gate.

There is also another series of blocked gates called the [[Huldah_Gates|Huldah Gates]], accessible from the [[Southern_Wall_Excavations|Southern Wall Excavations]]. Dating from the [[Herod|Herod]]ian period, these sets of gates (one single, one double, and one triple) were used by pilgrims coming to the [[Second_Temple|Second Temple]] and were within the city walls until Crusader times. The gates lead to a series of tunnels beneath [[Temple_Mount|Temple Mount]]. Because of the large crowds of people that thronged the Temple during the pilgrimage festival, one gate was used to enter the Temple compound and the other to exit it. One exception was mourners, who would use the opposite route. There are many more gates to 圣殿山 within the walls of the Old City.
