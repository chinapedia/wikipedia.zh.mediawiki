'''苏克棚'''是[[犹太人|犹太人]]在庆祝[[住棚节|住棚节]]期间所住的临时棚屋。

==结构==
<!-- According to [[Halakha|Halakha]], a ''sukkah'' is a structure consisting of 2½, 3, or 4 walls with a roof made of an [[life|organic]] material which has been disconnected from the ground (the ''s'chach''). It should be at least three feet tall, and be positioned so that all or part of its roof is open to the sky (only the part which is under the sky is [[kosher|kosher]].) A ''sukkah'' can be built on the ground or on an open porch or balcony. Portable ''sukkahs'' are available for those who have little space, or for those who are travelling (in order to have a place to eat one's meals). -->

苏克棚的墙壁可以用从木材到帆布到铝的各种材料建造，而建造屋顶的材料包括松树枝、棕榈叶和竹子。墙壁也可以部分利用房屋或栅栏。有关墙壁结构、高度、间距、材料的详细资料在各种解经书中都可以找到。

<!-- ==S'chach==
''S'chach'' is the Hebrew name for the material used as a roof for a sukkah. ''S'chach'' has to have grown from the ground, but then must be disconnected from it. [[Palm_tree|Palm leaves]], [[Bamboo|bamboo sticks]] and [[pine|pine]] branches and even wood as well as many other types of [[organic_material|organic material]] could all be used for ''s'chach'' unless they were processed for a different use. -->

==装饰==

许多人在苏克棚的内墙和天花板上悬挂塑料水果、彩带、闪亮的装饰物和图画。全家还会沿着内墙排成一队，回顾以色列人在旷野中由云柱带领的情形。<!-- The Chabad custom is not to decorate the sukkah, 因为苏克棚本身被认为是一种美丽的物体。<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/holidays/JewishNewYear/template.asp?AID=420827 How To Build Your Sukkah]</ref> -->

<!-- ====What is done in the Sukkah?====
In Israel and in temperate climates, observant Jews will conduct all their eating, studying, and sleeping activities in the ''sukkah''. Many Jews will not eat anything except water or fruit outside the ''sukkah''. In Israel, it is common practice for hotels, restaurants, snack shops, and outdoor tourist attractions (such as the zoo) to provide an eating ''sukkah'' for their guests. [[Lubavitch|Lubavitch]]er and [[Belz|Belz]]er<ref>Nitei Gavriel, Hilchos Rosh Hashanah Ch. 29 note 9 (5754 Edition)</ref> Hasidim differ from other Orthodox Jews in that they don't sleep in the ''sukkah'' due to its intrinsic holiness.<ref>[http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=92423 The Sukkah and Sleeplessness]</ref>

In cold climates such as [[美国东部|美国东部]], [[加拿大|加拿大]]和[[英国|英国]], full observance of the [[mitzvah|mitzvah]] of sleeping in the ''sukkah'' is almost impossible. Some Jews in these locales will spend some time in the ''sukkah'' eating and relaxing but go indoors to sleep. Though one need not eat or sleep in the ''sukkah'' if it is raining, Lubavitcher Hasidim will still eat there. -->

<!-- ==Symbolism==
Although the festival of Sukkot is a joyous occasion, and is referred to in Hebrew as ''Yom Simchateinu'' (the day of our rejoicing) or ''Z'man Simchateinu'', (the season of our rejoicing), the ''sukkah'' itself symbolises the frailty and transience of life. It also reminds its dwellers that true security comes from faith in God, rather than from money or possessions. -->

<!-- ==''Ushpizzin''==
{{Distinguish2|[[Ushpizin|Ushpizin]], a movie}}
During the holiday, Jews invite seven spiritual "guests" (known as ''ushpizzin'' in [[Aramaic_Language|Aramaic]]) to be with them in the ''sukkah''. These ''ushpizzin'' are the seven "shepherds" of Israel. They are: -->

<!-- In recent times, there are some Jews who also add seven spiritual women or ''ushpizzot'' to join in the sukkah. [http://www.wlcj.org/outlook_articles/sukkah.html]

According to tradition, each night a different guest enters the ''sukkah'' first and the other six follow. The custom of inviting guests to the ''sukkah'' also includes living guests; many people invite family, friends, neighbours, or people who are alone to join them for a snack or a meal. Anyone, including [[gentiles|gentiles]], are more than welcome inside a Sukkah. -->
