'''国际经济学，'''是[[经济学|经济学]]的一門分支學科，主要探討在跨國的經濟活動中，生產與消費的循環過程。此學科以宏觀的角度，則是著重於各國之間的貿易、投資與移民議題分析。其分支研究為[[国际贸易|国际贸易]]、[[国际金融学|国际金融]]以及相关[[经济政策|经济政策]]。

==國際貿易==
===研究範疇與研究方法===

國際貿易理論與其他經濟學門的不同之處，在於其以國家作為[[資本|資本]]、[[勞動力|勞動力]]等有限資源的主要分析單位。也就是說，國際經濟學與其他的經濟分析，原理上並沒有多大差異，而是在分析規模上，國際經濟學著重於分析國家在跨地域中的貿易過程。因此，國際經濟學的研究方法與其他的經濟學研究所使用的模型、理論差不多。然而，由於政府對於貿易常會有所規範或限制，所以國際經濟學的研究較多在分析政策影響經濟之間的因果關係。

國際經濟學的大致可劃分為兩類－－古典理論與現代貿易理論。以古典理論稱之的經濟學研究大略源自於[[大衛·李嘉圖#学术思想|李嘉圖]]的[[比較利益法則|比較利益法則]]，以此為基礎所演繹而生的一系列理論。另一方面，現代理論分析則主要以實證經驗為歸納、分析基礎。

<!---The law of ''[[comparative_advantage|comparative advantage]]'' provides a logical explanation of international trade as the rational consequence of the comparative advantages that arise from inter-regional differences -  regardless of how those differences arise.  Since its exposition by John Stuart Mill <ref>[http://www.econlib.org/Library/Ricardo/ricP2a.html#Ch.7,%20On%20Foreign%20Trade,%20comparative%20advantage  David Ricardo ''On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation''  Chapter 7  John Murray, 1821. Third edition.(First published: 1817)]</ref> the techniques of neo-classical economics have been applied to it to model the patterns of trade that would result from various postulated sources of comparative advantage. However, extremely restrictive (and often unrealistic) assumptions have had to be adopted in order to make the problem amenable to theoretical analysis. The best-known of the resulting models, the [[Heckscher-Ohlin_theorem|Heckscher-Ohlin theorem]] (H-O) 
<ref>[http://internationalecon.com/Trade/Tch60/T60-8.php The Heckscher-Ohlin Theorem]</ref> depends upon the assumptions of no international  differences of technology, productivity, or consumer preferences; no obstacles to pure competition or free trade and  no scale economies. On those assumptions, it derives a model of the trade patterns that would arise solely from  international  differences in the relative abundance of  labour and capital (referred to as factor endowments).  The resulting theorem states that, on those assumptions, a country  with a relative abundance of capital would export capital-intensive products and import labour-intensive products. The theorem proved to be of very limited predictive value, as was demonstrated by what came to be known as the "[[Leontief_Paradox|Leontief Paradox]]" (the discovery that, despite its capital-rich factor endowment,  America was exporting labour-intensive products and importing capital-intensive products <ref>Wassily  Leontief, ''Domestic Production and Foreign Trade: The American Capital Position Re-examined'' Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol. XCVII p332 September 1953</ref>)  Nevertheless the  theoretical techniques (and many of the assumptions) used in deriving  the H-O model  were subsequently used to  derive further theorems. The [[Stolper-Samuelson_theorem|Stolper-Samuelson theorem]] <ref>[http://www.ucd.ie/economic/staff/pneary/pdf/stolpers.pdf The Stolper-Samuelson theorem]</ref><ref>Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson ''Protection and Real Wages''' Review of Economic Studies, 9: 58-73. 1941</ref> , which is often described as a corollary of the H-O theorem, was an early example. In its most general form it states that if the price of a good rises (falls) then the price of the factor used intensively in that industry will also rise (fall) while the price of the other factor will fall (rise). In the international trade context for which it was devised it means that trade lowers the real wage of the scarce factor of production, and protection from trade raises it.  Another corollary of the H-O theorem is Samuelson's factor price equalisation theorem <ref> Paul Samuelson: "International Trade and the Equalization of Factor Prices", '' The Economic Journal'' June 1949</ref> which states that as trade between countries tends to equalise their product prices, it tends also to equalise the prices paid to their factors of production. Those theories have sometimes been taken to mean that trade between an industrialised country and a developing country would lower the wages of the unskilled in the industrialised country. (But, as  noted below, that conclusion depends upon the unlikely  assumption that productivity is the same in the two countries). Large numbers of learned papers have been produced in attempts to elaborate on the H-O and Stolper-Samuelson theorems, and while many of them are considered to provide valuable insights, they  have seldom proved to be directly applicable to the task of explaining trade patterns.
