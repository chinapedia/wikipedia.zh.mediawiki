'''格拉咸·泰萊'''{{OBE}}（{{lang-en|'''Graham Taylor'''}}，{{bd|1944年|9月15日|2017年|1月12日|catidx=Taylor, Graham}}）出生於[[英格蘭|英格蘭]][[東密德蘭|東密德蘭]][[諾丁漢郡|諾丁漢郡]][[沃克索普|沃克索普]]（Worksop），是一名前[[足球|足球]][[運動員|運動員]]及[[教練|領隊]]。泰萊於執教屈福特時打出名堂，在短短五年間將球隊由最低的[[英格蘭足球聯賽|丁組]]一直升班至頂級的[[英格蘭足球聯賽|甲組]]，其後更獲委擔任[[英格蘭足球代表隊|英格蘭國家隊]]的領隊，並差不多廿年後第二度任教屈福特，又於兩年內帶領球隊由第三級的乙組聯賽榜末升班到[[英超|英超]]。

泰萊在[[北林肯郡|北林肯郡]]的[[钢|鋼鐵]][[工業|工業]]重鎮[[斯肯索普|斯肯索普]]成長，到直現在仍然有聯繫並視作自己的家鄉<ref>{{cite news |first = 格拉咸 |last = 泰萊 |title = Taylor on Saturday |url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2005/02/19/sfntay19.xml |work = [[每日电讯报|''telegraph.co.uk'']] |date = 2005-02-19 |accessdate = 2008-03-16 | location=倫敦}}</ref>。他是《斯肯索普電訊晚報》（''Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph''）一名[[記者|體育記者]]的兒子<ref>Edworthy, 第156頁</ref>，他於兒時在「舊展覽場」（Old Show Ground）觀賞[[斯坎索普联足球俱乐部|斯肯索普]]作賽而開始喜愛足球運動，最終更成為一名足球運動員，為[[格林斯比镇足球俱乐部|甘士比]]和[[林肯城足球俱乐部|林肯城]]擔任[[後衛_(足球)#边後衛|邊後衞]]。

1972年泰萊因傷退役後，轉而擔任教練及領隊工作，於任教[[林肯城足球俱乐部|林肯城]]、[[沃特福德足球俱乐部|屈福特]]和[[阿士東維拉足球會|阿士東維拉]]均取得優秀成績。他成功為執教的三支球隊護級及贏得升班資格，更先後帶領屈福特及阿士東維拉於1983年及1990年同樣屈居[[利物浦足球俱乐部|利物浦]]之後取得聯賽亞軍，並領導屈福特在1984年晉級[[英格蘭足總盃|英格蘭足總盃]]決賽，以0-2負於另一支[[利物浦|利物浦市]]球隊[[埃弗顿足球俱乐部|愛華頓]]。

1990年泰萊成為[[英格蘭足球代表隊|英格蘭國家隊]]領隊，於未能取得在[[美國|美國]]舉行的[[1994年世界盃足球賽|1994年世界盃]]決賽週資格後，在1990年11月宣佈辭職，他於任期內的差劣成績遭到各方嚴厲的批評。1994年3月泰萊返回球會任教，在屈福特重振聲威，於1999年升班[[英超|英超]]，重奪12年前於泰萊離隊後失去的頂級聯賽資格。他最後一次執教鞭是在2002年重返阿士東維拉，並於2002/03年球季結束後離隊。泰萊現時擔任[[英国广播公司#电台|BBC Radio 5直播]]（BBC Radio 5 Live）的[[時事評論員|足球評論員]]和[[沃特福德足球俱乐部|屈福特]]的[[主席|主席]]。

泰萊是唯一一名領隊曾兩度領導球隊在兩分制的[[英格蘭足球聯賽|英格蘭足球聯賽]]單季取得超越70分，分別是1975/76年球季在[[林肯城足球俱乐部|林肯城]]的74分和1975/76年球季在[[沃特福德足球俱乐部|屈福特]]的71分，這記錄更難能可貴的是只有兩支其他球隊曾取得超越70分，分別是[[唐卡斯特流浪足球俱乐部|唐卡士打]]在1946/47年球季取得72分和[[罗瑟勒姆足球俱乐部|洛達咸]]在1950/51年球季取得71分。

==生平==
===早年===
He moved to a [[council_house|council house]] in Scunthorpe in 1947, where his father Thomas was the sports reporter for the Scunthorpe Evening Telegraph. He went to the [http://www.hendersonavenue.n-lincs.sch.uk Henderson Avenue Junior School], then Scunthorpe Grammar School (now [http://www.highridgeschool.co.uk High Ridge School]), where he met his wife, Rita, from [[Winteringham|Winteringham]]. He played for the England Grammar Schools football team, and joined the sixth-form after passing six-[[O-levels|O-levels]] in 1961, but he left after one year to pursue a full-time career in football. This was highly unusual for a Grammar School pupil and his teachers disapproved of his actions. Taylor always preferred football to rugby at Grammar School. He joined Grimsby Town, and played his first competitive game for them in September 1963 against Newcastle United when they won 2–1. In early 1965 Graham Taylor married Rita Cowling. They had two daughters, Joanne and Karen, whilst Taylor was at Grimsby. They also lived in [[Cleethorpes|Cleethorpes]]. When he moved to Lincoln, he bought his first house in [[North_Hykeham|North Hykeham]].

===球員===
{{Expand section|date=October 2008}}
His playing career began with [[Grimsby_Town_F.C.|Grimsby Town]] in 1962  for whom he went on to play 189 games at fullback, scoring twice. He was transferred to [[Lincoln_City_F.C.|Lincoln City]] in the summer of 1968, he scored 1 goal in 150 appearances before being forced to retire from playing following a serious hip injury in 1972. He was dubbed to have said to be thinking of an early retirement shortly before this happened because of family matters, but this was never confirmed.

===領隊===
;林肯城（1972–1977）
Taylor was the youngest person to become a [[the_Football_Association|FA]] coach, at the age of 27. Following his retirement from playing, Taylor became manager of [[Lincoln_City_F.C.|Lincoln City]], being the youngest manager in the league at the age of 28 in December 1972. Taylor led Lincoln to the [[Football_League_Fourth_Division|Fourth Division]] title in 1976, during which the Imps set the league records for most wins (32), fewest defeats (4), and most points (74) (when 2 points were awarded for a win).

;屈福特（1977–1987）
In 1977, the 32-year-old Taylor was hired to manage [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] by new owner [[Elton_John|Elton John]]. He turned down an approach from First Division [[West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in favour of a Fourth Division club, which caused a major surprise among many observers.

Taylor led Watford from the [[Football_League_Fourth_Division|Football League Fourth Division]] to the First Division in only five years. In this first season in the Football League Fourth Division Watford won the title at his first attempt during the [[1977–78_in_English_football|1977–78 season]], losing only five of 46 games and winning the league by 11 points. In the [[Football_League_Third_Division|Football League Third Division]] Taylor led Watford to another promotion, finishing second, and losing out on the title by one point in the [[1978–79_in_English_football|1978–1979 season]].

Taylor's third season in the [[Football_League_Second_Division|Football League Second Division]] was less successful. Indicating the tougher competition, Watford managed only a 18th finish, out of 22 teams, avoiding relegation by eight points and winning only 12 of their 42 games in the [[1979–80_in_English_football|1979–1980 season]]. In the next season, the [[1979–80_in_English_football|1980–1981 season]], Taylor improved Watford's performance, ending it with 16 wins and a 9th place finish. In the [[1981–82_in_English_football|81–82 season]] Watford achieved promotion, ending the season in 2nd place, and gaining 23 wins and 11 draws in 46 games.

In the First Division with Taylor as manager, Watford gained its highest-ever victory (8–0 against Sunderland, with Luther Blissett scoring four) as well as the "double" over Arsenal, an away win at Tottenham Hotspur, and home victories over Everton and Liverpool; this resulted in Watford finishing runners-up in the entire Football League. He then took the side to the third round of the [[UEFA_Cup|UEFA Cup]], having finished second in [[1982-83_in_English_football|1982–83]] (the club's first season as a top division club). Taylor also led Watford to the [[1984_FA_Cup_Final|1984 FA Cup Final]], which Watford lost to [[Everton_F.C.|Everton]] 2–0. In his final season, [[1986-87_in_English_football|1986–87]], Watford finished ninth in the league and reached the FA Cup semi-finals, missing out on another [[Wembley_Stadium_(1923)|Wembley]] appearance when they lost to [[Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.|Tottenham]], their chances hardly helped by the fact that both of their first team goalkeepers were injured.

;阿士東維拉（1987–1990）
In June 1987, Taylor left Watford for a new challenge at [[Aston_Villa_F.C.|Aston Villa]], who had just been relegated from the First Division. It was a terrible setback for the Midlanders, who had won the [[European_Cup|European Cup]] just five years earlier and had been league champions six years earlier.

Taylor managed to take Aston Villa back to the top flight with his first attempt, securing their top flight safety in [[1988-89_in_English_football|1988–89]] with a win on the final day of the league season. During his third season at the club Villa finished runners-up in the first division, having led the league table at several stages of the season before being overhauled in the final weeks by [[Liverpool_F.C.|Liverpool]]. Following this success, Taylor accepted an offer to take over the [[England_national_football_team|England national football team]] from [[Bobby_Robson|Bobby Robson]], who left the job after England's [[Football_World_Cup|world cup]] semi-final defeat to [[Germany_national_football_team|Germany]].

;英格蘭（1990–1993）
When Graham Taylor took over the highest managerial job in English Football many complained that he was doing so without ever having won a major trophy – even though he had taken teams to second place in the league twice and an [[FA_Cup_final|FA Cup final]] once. It was also pointed out Taylor had never played in 'top flight' football let alone international level and that winning the respect of the players would be difficult. His critics also noted although he had ditched the long-ball game at Aston Villa there was still tactical worries about his intentions when English clubs were looking to dispense with "route one" football in favour of a more "picturesque route to goal".<ref>Edworthy, pp. 14–147</ref>

Despite the unease at his appointment, England lost just once in Taylor's first 23 matches ( a 0–1 defeat to [[Germany_national_football_team|Germany]] at [[Wembley_Stadium_(1923)|Wembley Stadium]] in September 1991).<ref>Edworthy, p. 148</ref> However, England struggled to qualify for [[1992_European_Football_Championship|Euro '92]]. In a group containing [[Turkey_national_football_team|Turkey]], [[Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team|Ireland]], and [[Poland_national_football_team|Poland]] England were held to 1–1 twice by the Irish and managed just 1–0 wins home and away against Turkey. It was only a last ditch goal from [[Gary_Lineker|Gary Lineker]] against Poland that saw England qualify at the expense of the Irish. England's qualification for the Euro 92 finals proved to be the high point of Taylor's tenure.<ref>Edworthy 1997, p. 148.</ref> 

The number of players that Taylor was using in the run up to the championship was also questioned, and the gentlemen of the press viewed this as evidence Taylor did not not know his best team. He used 59 players in total, as he struggled to find a 'new spine' after the retirement of [[Peter_Shilton|Peter Shilton]], [[Terry_Butcher|Terry Butcher]] and [[Bryan_Robson|Bryan Robson]].<ref>Edworthy 1997, p. 156.</ref> He also faced accusations he could not cope with 'stars', after he dropped [[Paul_Gascoigne|Paul Gascoigne]] for [[Gordon_Cowans|Gordon Cowans]] for a qualifying game against Ireland,<ref>Edworthy 1997, p. 149.</ref> fearing he might "lose his head" in what would a "bruising" encounter.<ref>Edworthy 1997, p. 1150.</ref>

Matters were not helped by Taylor's reluctance to use creative players who did not have high work rates, such as [[Chris_Waddle|Chris Waddle]] and [[Peter_Beardsley|Peter Beardsley]]. He also suffered several injuries, notably to [[Gary_Stevens|Gary Stevens]], Lee Dixon, John Barnes and [[Paul_Gascoigne|Paul Gascoigne]], leaving the squad in make-shift mode going into the finals. The loss of [[Mark_Wright|Mark Wright]] led to Taylor trying to call up [[Tony_Adams|Tony Adams]], but UEFA refused, citing that it was too late. 

England was drawn to face [[France_national_football_team|France]], [[Denmark_national_football_team|Denmark]] and hosts [[Sweden_national_football_team|Sweden]]. In the opening game England  started brightly and missed several chances to take a healthy lead. Platt was guilty of particularly glaring miss. Thereafter, the Danes began to dominate the match, and nearly won the game with minutes left as [[John_Jensen|John Jensen]] struck a post. The game ended 0–0.<ref>Granville, Brian ''England's Managers: The Toughest Job in Football'' 2007, ISBN 978-0755316519 p. 176.</ref> In the match against France, Platt nearly scored with a diving header which went inches wide of the post, and [[Stuart_Pearce|Stuart Pearce]] hit the bar with a free-kick. The game ended 0–0.<ref>http://www.englandfootballonline.com/MatchRsl/SumsGiller1990-96.html England v France 14 June 1992.</ref>

England needed to beat hosts [[Sweden_national_football_team|Sweden]] to advance to the semi-finals. Lineker crossed for Platt to open the scoring on four minutes, with a miss-kicked volley. However, England wasted several chanced to extend their lead. Platt made a pass to [[Tony_Daley|Tony Daley]] who wasted a chance to pass to Lineker in the open. England held a slender 1–0 lead at half-time.<ref>http://www.englandfootballonline.com/Seas1990-00/1991-92/M0688Swe1992.html England National Football Team Match No. 688, 17 June 1992</ref><ref>Granville, Brian ''England's Managers: The Toughest Job in Football'' 2007, ISBN 978-0755316519 p. 177.</ref> After half-time, the Swedes changed their personnel and formation, and dominated the second half, scoring twice to win 2–1. England was eliminated.<ref>http://www.englandfootballonline.com/MatchRsl/SumsGiller1990-96.html England v Sweden 17 June 1992</ref>

During the game, after 60 minutes and with the score at 1–1, Taylor substituted [[Gary_Lineker|Gary Lineker]] in his final game for England. By doing this, he prevented Lineker from having the chance of equalling, or possibly even breaking, [[Bobby_Charlton|Bobby Charlton]]'s record of 49 goals for England. Many were dismayed to see Taylor substitute England's top striker when his side needed a goal. This led to the media's vilification of Taylor, including the "turnip" campaign by [[The_Sun_(newspaper)|The Sun]], which began the morning after the game under the headline: "[[Rutabaga|Swedes]] 2 Turnips 1". During that campaign the newspaper's back page featured an image of Taylor's face superimposed onto a [[turnip|turnip]].<ref>Edworthy, p. 149</ref>

Taylor's relationship with the press was partially restored when he admitted his mistakes a few weeks after the finals.<ref>Malam, pp. 120–121</ref> However, this did not last long. England's first game after Euro 92 ended in a 1–0 defeat to Spain in a friendly, the [[The_Sun_(newspaper)|''The Sun'']] depicted Taylor as a "Spanish onion".<ref name="Edworthy, p151">Edworthy, p. 151</ref>

England were drawn in Qualification Group 2 for the [[1994_FIFA_World_Cup|1994 FIFA World Cup]] in the United States. The group contained [[Norway_national_football_team|Norway]], [[Netherlands_national_football_team|The Netherlands]], [[Poland_national_football_team|Poland]], [[Turkey_national_football_team|Turkey]] and [[San_Marino_national_football_team|San Marino]]. England were expected to qualify along with the Dutch. 

England began with a disappointing 1–1 draw with Norway. Norway were the early pace setters, with victories over San Marino, the Netherlands and Turkey. Gascoigne returned, but the Norwegians were confident.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-england-turn-to-gascoigne-for-dream-start-1557388.html England turn to Gascoigne for dream start</ref> Despite dominating the game, England could muster only half chances. Platt gave England the lead in the 55th minute after a cross from Stuart Pearce. Norway rarely threatened, but equalised in the 77th minute, when [[Kjetil_Rekdal|Kjetil Rekdal]] scored from 20 yards. The draw flattered the Norwegians, but put them clear in the group.

The campaign seemed to get back on track with two wins against Turkey (4–0 at home and 2–0 away) and a 6–0 home victory over San Marino. In April 1993 England faced the [[Netherlands_national_football_team|Netherlands]] at [[Wembley_Stadium_(1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. England went 2–0 up in 24 minutes through [[John_Barnes_(footballer)|John Barnes]] and [[David_Platt_(footballer)|David Platt]]. However Taylor's luck had started to take a turn for the worse, as [[Paul_Gascoigne|Paul Gascoigne]] was injured by [[Jan_Wouters|Jan Wouters]]' elbow, but the Dutchman was not sent off. [[Dennis_Bergkamp|Dennis Bergkamp]] scored a goal for the Netherlands towards the end of the first half, against the run of play, but England continued to control the game, and looked to be heading for a win which would have ended Dutch hopes of qualification, following the side's defeat in Norway, and a draw at home to the Poles. But four minutes from full-time [[Marc_Overmars|Marc Overmars]] outpaced [[Des_Walker|Des Walker]], prompting Walker to foul him inside the penalty area. The penalty was converted by [[Peter_Van_Vossen|Peter Van Vossen]] and the game ended 2–2. Suddenly England's "World Cup life" looked in danger.<ref name="Edworthy, p151"/>

England's next chance of reviving their flagging fortunes came in May, requiring at least a win and draw away against Poland and Norway which were to be played just three days apart. England were poor against Poland and were largely outplayed.<ref name="Edworthy, p152">Edworthy, p. 152</ref> [[Dariusz_Adamczuk|Dariusz Adamczuk]] of Poland scored in the 36th minute, although the team missed several chances to extend their lead. [[Ian_Wright|Ian Wright]] salvaged a vital point through forcing an equaliser in the 85th minute, for a final score of 1–1.<ref name="Edworthy, p152"/> Taylor was again vilified for his team's poor performance. England's next opponents were Norway.

The Norwegians had arrived from obscurity and had taken the group by storm with a series of early victories which had left England, Poland, and The Netherlands scrapping for second place.<ref name="Edworthy, p152"/> Taylor made wholesale changes of personnel and tactics, which again drew criticism, his actions considered risky in what was now a crucial game. [[Lee_Sharpe|Lee Sharpe]] and [[Lee_Dixon|Lee Dixon]] came on as wing-backs, while [[Carlton_Palmer|Carlton Palmer]] and Platt occupied midfield berths. Gascoigne supported [[Teddy_Sheringham|Teddy Sheringham]] and [[Les_Ferdinand|Les Ferdinand]] up-front. Des Walker, [[Tony_Adams|Tony Adams]] and [[Gary_Pallister|Gary Pallister]] formed a back three.<ref name="Edworthy, p152"/>

England lost 2–0, with few attempts on goal. [[Lars_Bohinen|Lars Bohinen]] and [[Øyvind_Leonhardsen|Øyvind Leonhardsen]] scored the goals in the 42nd and 47th minutes. The first was caused by a Des Walker error, while Walker was beaten for pace by a Norwegian counter-attack for Bohinen to score<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--world-cup-norway-destroy-taylors-england-calamity-in-oslo-as-a-revamped-team-collapses-in-the-face-of-scandinavian-skill-1489441.html| location=London | work=The Independent | first= Joe| last= Lovejoy| title= Norway destroy Taylor's England: Calamity in Oslo as a revamped team collapses in the face of Scandinavian skill | date=3 June 1993}}</ref>

Subsequently Taylor said "We made a complete mess of it. I'm here to be shot at and take the rap. I have no defence for our performance",<ref name="Edworthy, p153">Edworthy, p. 153</ref> although his honesty did not spare him a roasting from the press, who were now calling for his head.<ref name="Edworthy, p153"/> The press came up with headlines such as "NORSE MANURE" and "OSLO RANS".<ref>''Do I Not Like That -The Final Chapter''</ref>

With their World Cup hopes hanging by a thread, Taylor's England were to play a four-team Tournament in the U.S ([[1993_U.S._Cup|1993 U.S. Cup]]), which was expected to be a precursor to the following summer's tournament. Taylor stated before the game against the [[United_States_men's_national_soccer_team|USA]]:<blockquote>In football, you're only as good as your last game, and at the moment we're poor. You can always lose any game, to anyone. It's how you lose that matters. That was the thing that shocked us all in Norway. We would have been looking for a win here anyhow, but if we'd won last week it wouldn't have been considered essential. Now it is. Whether we like it or not, people expect us to beat America, and there is definitely more intensity about this game because of our performance in the last one.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-batty-given-the-safetypin-role-for-beltandbraces-england-walker-and-sheringham-dropped-in-wake-of-norway-humiliation-as-us-cup-opener-against-united-states-becomes-of-vital-importance-to-taylors-tenure-1490608.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Football: Batty given the safety-pin role for belt-and-braces England: Walker and Sheringham dropped in wake of Norway humiliation as US Cup opener against United States becomes of vital importance to Taylor's tenure | first=Joe | last=Lovejoy | date=9 June 1993 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref></blockquote>

For Taylor the US Cup began with a humiliating 2–0 defeat in [[Boston|Boston]] to the USA which was reported by the tabloid press in Britain as "YANKS 2 PLANKS 0!".<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-painful-failure-of-a-proud-man-trevor-haylett-on-the-highs-and-lows-in-graham-taylors-career-1506464.html ''Football: The painful failure of a proud man: Trevor Haylett on the highs and lows in Graham Taylor's career''

The [[1993-94_in_English_football|1993–94 season]] began with a much improved performance, with a 3–0 win over Poland raising the nation's hopes going into what was now the crucial match against the Dutch in [[Rotterdam|Rotterdam]].<ref name="Edworthy, p154">Edworthy, p. 154</ref>

In October England were to play the Netherlands in Rotterdam. With Norway having won the group the encounter would effectively decide the second and last qualifier of the group. The game was played at a furious pace, with the Dutch putting the English under pressure early on. However England hit back with a string of counter attacks, with Platt heading just wide and [[Tony_Adams|Tony Adams]] having a shot cleared off the line by [[Erwin_Koeman|Erwin Koeman]], while [[Tony_Dorigo|Tony Dorigo]] hit a post with a 35-yard free-kick after 25 minutes.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/><ref>http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/incoming/article109937.ece/BINARY/Holland+2-0+England ''Rotter'': Holland 2 England 0, October 1993.</ref> Two minutes before half-time England were fortunate to have a [[Frank_Rijkaard|Frank Rijkaard]] goal ruled out for offside, even though replays showed the goal was legitimate.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/> However later in the second half with the game locked at 0–0 David Platt was fouled by [[Ronald_Koeman|Ronald Koeman]] as he raced in on goal. The German referee failed to apply the rule of sending him off for a professional foul. The Dutch charged down Dorigo's free-kick, with Dutch players clearly encroaching.<ref>Glanville, Brian. ''England Managers: The Toughest Job in Football'', p. 185.</ref> Just minutes later the Dutchman took an identical free kick outside England's penalty area. His first shot was blocked, but it was ordered to be retaken because of [[encroachment|encroachment]].<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/> 
Koeman scored at the second attempt. [[Paul_Merson|Paul Merson]] hit a post with a free-kick moments later, while [[Dennis_Bergkamp|Dennis Bergkamp]] scored just moments later, despite using his arm to control the ball, for 2–0 win.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/> In the meantime Taylor was in an apoplectic mood on the touchline, berating the officials and referee as the significance of the result sank in.<ref name="Edworthy, p154"/>

England still had a chance to qualify if the Netherlands lost in Poland on the same night England were hoping they could run up a big score against part-time minnows San Marino. But it was in the final game that Taylor was to suffer the ultimate humiliation. After just 8.3 seconds of play [[David_Gualtieri|David Gualtieri]], a computer salesman, scored the fastest World Cup goal (as of 2009 it remains the fastest World Cup goal). England took another twenty minutes to find an equaliser and eventually won 7–1, but the Dutch had won in Poland and England had failed to qualify.

Taylor resigned on 24 November 1993. He went 'with great sadness', saying: 'No one can gauge the depth of my personal disappointment at not qualifying for the World Cup.' There had been no question of him wanting to stay on, in any capacity. 'This is the appropriate course of action in the circumstances,' he said. 'If we didn't qualify, it was always my intention to offer my resignation.'<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-howe-set-to-become-england-caretaker-taylor-accepts-the-inevitable-and-tenders-resignation-as-fa-considers-its-options-with-chief-executive-favouring-twotier-administration-1506463.html ''Football: Howe set to become England caretaker: Taylor accepts the inevitable and tenders resignation as FA considers its options with chief executive favouring two-tier administration.''</ref>

Taylor had also agreed to be filmed during the [[1994_FIFA_World_Cup_qualification_(UEFA)|qualifying campaign]] for ''[[Cutting_Edge_(Channel_4_TV_series)|Cutting Edge]]'', a [[Channel_4|Channel 4]] [[fly_on_the_wall|fly-on-the-wall]] documentary series, in which his portrayal further undermined his authority. During the film, Taylor was heard to use foul language, and what became his personal [[catchphrase|catchphrase]]: "Do I not like that", uttered just before England conceded a goal to [[Poland_national_football_team|Poland]].

;狼隊（1994–1995）
[[Sir_Jack_Hayward|Sir Jack Hayward]] appointed Taylor as manager of [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.|Wolves]] in March 1994, replacing [[Graham_Turner|Graham Turner]]. Taylor had been a generally unpopular figure in English football since his unsuccessful reign as national coach, and few people seemed willing to forgive him for his first managerial failure – one that mattered most to so many people up and down the country.

But he took the Midlands club to fourth in Division One to qualify for the playoffs – their highest league finish since their last top division season 11 years earlier – where they lost out to [[Bolton_Wanderers_F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. They also reached the quarter finals of the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] after a memorable replay penalty shootout victory over [[Sheffield_Wednesday|Sheffield Wednesday]], in which they were 3–0 down on penalties, only to win the shootout 4–3, in which [[Chris_Bart-Williams|Chris Bart-Williams]] had two penalties saved over the two matches. 

Taylor spent heavily on players while at Wolves, paying large sums for the likes of [[Steve_Sedgley|Steve Sedgley]], [[Tony_Daley|Tony Daley]] and [[Don_Goodman|Don Goodman]].<ref>[http://www.thewolvessite.co.uk/managers.htm]</ref>

However, the [[1994-95_in_English_football#Endsleigh_League_Division_One|1994–95 season]] proved to be his only full season at [[Molineux_Stadium|Molineux]], as, after a poor start to the following campaign, winning just 4 from the 16 opening league games, he resigned in November 1995 due to overwhelming supporter pressure. During his tenure, he attempted to perform a [[citizen's_arrest|citizen's arrest]] on a fan who had spat at him, prompting calls for closer crowd controls in the English game.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football--------------------------taits-prank-finishes-with-an-fa-charge-1617082.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=FOOTBALL             Tait's 'prank' finishes with an FA charge | first=Nick | last=Duxbury | date=25 April 1995 | accessdate=4 May 2010}}</ref>

;重返屈福特（1996–2001）
In February 1996 [[Elton_John|Elton John]], who had recently bought Watford for a second time, appointed Taylor as General Manager at Vicarage Road. Just over a year later Taylor had appointed himself as the club's manager succeeding [[Kenny_Jackett|Kenny Jackett]], who was relegated to a coaching capacity at the club. He won the Division Two championship at his first attempt in 1998, despite having a life-threatening abscess that blocked his windpipe and almost killed him.<ref>http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/profile-graham-taylor--the-turnip-strikes-back-1111071.html The Turnip Strikes Back</ref>

The following season Taylor won the [[1999_Football_League_First_Division_play-off_Final|Division One Play-off Final]], beating Bolton Wanderers 2–0 at Wembley, and with it promotion to the [[Premier_league|Premier league]], where Watford were relegated after one season. Despite starting the following season well – unbeaten through the first fifteen league games and heading the table – Watford slumped to finish 9th in Division One with Taylor publicly stating he had lost his powers of motivation.  At this point Taylor decided to retire. During this final season Taylor had become only the third manager to manage 1,000 league games in England, after [[Brian_Clough|Brian Clough]] and [[Jim_Smith_(footballer)|Jim Smith]].

;重返阿士東維拉（2002–2003）
Taylor came out of retirement in February 2002 to return to his old job at Aston Villa, but retired for a second time after Villa finished the 2002–03 season in 16th place in the [[FA_Premier_League|Premiership]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Taylor quits Villa |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/aston_villa/3027817.stm |work= |publisher=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2003-05-14 |accessdate=2007-12-08 }}</ref> He subsequently cited tensions in his relationship with the club's chairman [[Doug_Ellis|Doug Ellis]] and argued for an overhaul of the club's upper management to allow the club to be more competitive.

===後領隊時期===
In 2003, Taylor became vice-president at [[Football_League_One|League One]] club [[Scunthorpe_United_F.C.|Scunthorpe United]], his hometown club. Since 2004, he has worked as a pundit on [[BBC_Radio_Five_Live|BBC Radio Five Live]], and has managed a team of celebrities for [[Sky_One|Sky One]]'s annual series, ''[[The_Match_(TV_series)|The Match]]''.

His time at Scunthorpe has seen a turnaround in the club's fortunes. In his [[2003-04_in_English_football|first season]] on the board, they narrowly avoided relegation to the [[Football_Conference|Conference]]. [[2004-05_in_English_football|The following season]], they were promoted to [[Football_League_One|League One]]. [[2006-07_in_English_football|Two years after that]], they were promoted to the [[Football_League_Championship|Football League Championship]] as League One champions.

Taylor returned to Watford on 23 January 2009, being appointed to the new [[Board_of_directors|board]] as a [[non-executive_director|non-executive director]] and was appointed interim chairman on 16 December 2009.<ref>http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1529215,00.html</ref>
