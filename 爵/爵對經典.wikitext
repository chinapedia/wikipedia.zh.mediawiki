《脸贴脸》（{{Lang-en|Cheek to Cheek}}）是由爵士歌手[[托尼·班奈特|托尼·班奈特]]与美国流行女歌手[[Lady_Gaga|Lady Gaga]]的一张合作专辑，亦是女神卡卡的第四張原創專輯，于2014年9月19日发行（美国为23日）。

2011年，托尼·班奈特与Lady Gaga在[[罗宾汉基金会|罗宾汉基金会]]晚会的后台初次相见，班奈特当时要求Gaga与他合作录制一首曲目。最终两者录制了经典曲目《The Lady Is a Tramp》的翻唱版本，并开始讨论共同合作一个爵士项目的计划。

班奈特和Gaga声称发行《Cheek to Cheek》的目的在于将爵士歌曲推广到年轻一代，他们认为这些曲目有全球的影响力。

专辑中的两支曲目被作为单曲发行以宣传专辑，分别是《Anything Goes》和《I Can't Give You Anything but Love》，两者都在公告牌爵士專輯排行榜成为冠军单曲。

該專輯獲得[[第57屆葛萊美獎|第57屆葛萊美獎]]「最佳傳統流行演唱專輯」。

<!--==背景与录制==
In September 2012, Tony Bennett stated in an interview with ''Rolling Stone'' that Lady Gaga wanted to do a jazz album with him. He said "of all things, she called me from New Zealand and said, 'I want to do a jazz album with you.'" Bennett says that the mystery composer is not as well known as greats like George Gershwin or Cole Porter, but has had several hits to his name.<ref name="RollingStone"/>

On January 8, 2013, Marion Evans, the Grammy-award nominated songwriter/composer who arranged Bennett and Gaga's duet "The Lady Is a Tramp" for Bennett's duet album, ''Duets II'', announced in an interview he would have a fairly significant part in the making of the album. "I don’t know at this point exactly how many songs will be on the CD, but I’m sure we’ll have about four or five different-sized orchestras or bands. It’ll turn into a giant panic, I can assure you. That’s just how this business is," he was quoted saying in the article.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/entertainment/local_entertainment/music/the-man-behind-the-music/article_9f6c30bc-923d-5b16-bd5a-66b70cb6b902.html |title=The man behind the music |publisher=phillyburbs.com |date=2013-01-08 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> Later that month, Lady Gaga, after her performance with Bennett at the final inaugural ball of President Obama's second inauguration, announced the album formally through her Twitter. "And here's me and my handsome date, I simply cannot wait for our album together, he's my darling!" she wrote as a caption for a photo tweeted of the pair.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/381340/lady-gaga-and-tony-bennett-to-collaborate-on-album?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-topstories&utm_source=eonline&utm_medium=rssfeeds&utm_campaign=rss_topstories |title=Lady Gaga and Tony Bennett to Collaborate on Album |publisher=E! |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/posts/la-et-ms-lady-gaga-album-tony-bennett-20130124,0,5946186.story |title=Lady Gaga confirms album with Tony Bennett |work=Los Angles Times |date=2013-01-24 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref>

In September 2013, Bennett announced in an interview the album will come out in January 2014, and was quoted saying, "We recorded all great standards, quality songs; url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/84528/lady-gaga-is-picasso-of-the-entertainment-world-says-tony-bennett#FjsrRIscC1Tz0XQQ.99 |title=Tony Bennett claims Lady Gaga is 'Picasso of the entertainment world' |publisher=Gigwise |date=2013-09-27 |accessdate=2013-11-03}}</ref> However, on December 12, in a interview to [[CNN, Benett revealed that album's release was delayed and it would be released "until the end of 2014".<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://operationgaga.com/news/lady-gaga-tony-bennetts-album-delayed}}</ref>-->
