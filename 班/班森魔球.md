《'''班森魔球'''》（{{lang-en|'''Rattleballs'''}}）是《[[探險活寶|探險活寶]]》[[探險活寶_(第五季)|第五季]]第四十六集的名稱。在[[卡通頻道|卡通頻道]]2014年1月27日播出。本集以[[小男孩阿寶|小男孩阿寶]]和魔法狗[[酷狗老皮|老皮]]為主角。在這一集裡，阿寶遇到舊型剑术戰鬥機器人名為班森魔球，並得知班森魔球是很久以前由泡泡糖所製造，來保護糖果王國的精英部隊，然而破壞性太大，所以將他們全部銷毀，除了班森魔球。經過短暫的前哨戰，班森魔球證明自己不會再度威脅，所以泡泡糖寬恕並不銷毀他。


<!--==劇情==
AAfter his breakup with Flame Princess, Finn vows to do whatever Princess Bubblegum wishes. Soon, however, he becomes a burden, and Bubblegum orders Finn to take some time off and rest. Finn wanders to the junkyard, where he is saved from a collapse of garbage by a mysterious swordsman. They soon duel, but Finn is quickly defeated. However, after Finn shows remarkable bravery in defeat, the mysterious swordsman spares him, but heavily criticizes his dueling skills.

The mysterious being is introduced as Rattleballs (voiced by [[Rainn_Wilson|Rainn Wilson]]), a hybrid gumball and robot warrior. He eventually agrees to take Finn on as his sword appreciative, and tells him about his past; he was originally a member of an elite police force created by Princess Bubblegum to patrol the Candy Kingdom, but once crime was largely eliminated, the robots became extremely violent and took to illegal [[street_fighting|street fighting]]. Bubblegum disbanded the entire contingent, although Rattleballs escaped and has been living in the junkyard ever since.

Finn, torn between loyalty to the princess and his newfound sword master, eventually tells Bubblegum due to his chivalric code of honor. Bubblegum orders her banana guards to arrest Rattleballs, although he easily—though non lethally—defeats the entire police force. Bubblegum, realizing that Rattleballs may not be a threat, pretends to decommission the robot, but allows him to patrol the city at night, fighting crime.

"Rattleballs" was written and storyboarded by [[Andy_Ristaino|Andy Ristaino]] and Cole Sanchez, from a story by [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Elizabeth Ito.<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Rattleballs| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Elizabeth Ito & Nick Jennings (directors); Andy Ristaino & Cole Sanchez (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=January 27, 2014 | season = 5 | number = 46}}</ref> Ward and Ristaino worked on developing the look for Rattleballs.<ref name=tumblrking/><ref name=skronked/> Initially, Ristaino wanted Finn to have a sword that would "talk back to him and insult his swordsmanship", although this idea was later scrapped because of the introduction of the grass sword in the previous episode.<ref name=skronked>{{cite web|last=Ristaino|first=Andy|title=Early 'Rattleballs' Concept Stuff|url=http://skronked.tumblr.com/post/74838092894/heres-some-early-rattleballs-concept-stuff-that|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}</ref>

Lead character designer Matt Forsythe helped develop the look for the "medieval banana guards"—who had originally appeared in the early episode "The Vault"—a task he later called "fun".<ref name=tumblrking>{{cite web|last=''Adventure Time'' crew|title=When I was a young robot, I went horseback riding...|url=http://kingofooo.tumblr.com/post/74898293774/when-i-was-a-young-robot-i-went-horseback-riding|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}</ref> Forsythe also modeled one of the banana guards after Chris, a 14 year old who had voiced a character in the episode "[[Root_Beer_Guy|Root Beer Guy]]" by means of the [[Make-A-Wish_Foundation|Make-A-Wish Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Forsythe|first=Matt|title=Chris, Honorary Banana Guard|url=http://instagram.com/p/jsjU79jAO0/|publisher=[[Instagram|Instagram]]|accessdate=April 20, 2014|date=January 2014}}</ref>

The episode guest stars [[Rainn_Wilson|Rainn Wilson]] as the titular character. Wilson, a reported fan of the show, brought his son Walter to the recording session because he too was a fan. Both DiMaggio and Shada were excited to meet and work with WIlson, both being fans of the American television series ''[[The_Office_(U.S._TV_series)|The Office]]'' in which Wilson played the character [[Dwight_Schrute|Dwight Schrute]]; DiMaggio later noted that, "He was kind of geeking out on us, and [Jeremy and I] were kind of geeking out on them."<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartoon Network|title=Adventure Time Live Video Q&A with Jeremy Shada and John DiMaggio {{!}} Cartoon Network|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwLhx38PRDA|publisher=[[YouTube|YouTube]]|accessdate=January 29, 2014|date=January 28, 2014}}</ref>
