Planning for Metro began with the Mass Transportation Survey in 1955, which attempted to forecast both freeway and mass transit systems sufficient to meet the needs of the region projected for 1980.<ref>Schrag at p. 33-38.</ref> In 1959, the study's final report included two rapid transit lines which anticipated subways in downtown Washington.<ref>Schrag at p. 39.</ref> Because the plan called for extensive freeway construction within the District of Columbia, alarmed residents lobbied for legislation which both created a new transportation agency and blocked freeway construction.<ref>Schrag at p. 42.</ref> The agency, the National Capital Transportation Administration, issued a 1962 ''Transportation in the National Capital Region'' report, which did not include the route that became the Green Line.<ref>Schrag at p. 55.</ref>  A central route under 7th Street in downtown was only added in 1967 primarily to serve the "inner city."<ref>Schrag at p. 112.</ref>

In March 1968, the [[Washington_Metropolitan_Area_Transit_Authority|Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority]] (WMATA) board approved its {{convert|98|mi|km|adj=on}} Adopted Regional System (ARS) which included the Green Line from Branch Avenue to Greenbelt. It also foresaw possible future extensions to [[Laurel,_Maryland|Laurel, Maryland]] and [[Brandywine,_Maryland|Brandywine, Maryland]].<ref>Schrag at p. 117.</ref>

Plans for rapid transit prior to the creation of WMATA in February 1967 focused on the needs of commuters while neglecting some of the District's less affluent neighborhoods.<ref name="Schrag at p. 106">Schrag at p. 106.</ref> However, by late 1966, some plans started to include a line along 7th Street in the District of Columbia.<ref name="Schrag at p. 106"/> The new line was included in WMATA's master plan for its proposed then-101-mile system in 1968.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart">{{cite news |last=Burgess |first=John |date=March 18, 1982 |title=Metro to Halt Start of Leg To Rosecroft |newspaper=Washington Post }}</ref> At that time, a Green Line was planned to pass through some of the area's poorest and most transit-dependent neighborhoods and provide them with subway service.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /> Riots following the death of [[Martin_Luther_King_Jr.|Martin Luther King]] in 1968 destroyed much of the commercial district around 14th and U Streets, and planners hoped that adding a subway stop in that area would stimulate redevelopment.<ref>Schrag at p. 211-12.</ref> The original 1969 plan called for a line under 13th Street NW with just two stations. However, in 1970, the District of Columbia Council agreed to pay an additional $3 million to add a third station and reroute the Green Line under U Street, and 14th Street NW.<ref name="Schrag at p. 213">Schrag at p. 213.</ref> The southern part of the Green Line was originally planned to pass over the [[11th_Street_Bridges|11th Street Bridges]] to the intersection of Good Hope Road SE and Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE,<ref name="DecadesFrustrating">{{cite news |last=Sisler |first=Peter F. |date=December 27, 1991 |title=Decades of Frustrating Debate Kept Green Line Sidetracked |newspaper=Washington Times}}</ref> follow Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE to [[Suitland_Parkway|Suitland Parkway]], down Suitland Parkway to Branch Avenue SE, and down Branch Avenue to a terminus at the intersection of Branch Avenue and the [[Interstate_495_(Capital_Beltway)|Capital Beltway]].<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /><ref name="Feaver">{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas |date=October 18, 1977 |title=Metro Choices Detailed |newspaper=Washington Post }}</ref><ref name="Vesey">{{cite news |last=Vesey |first=Tom |date=June 23, 1982 |title=Green Line War Heats Up Again |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Public hearings on whether to build a Green Line and the route it should take were completed in 1973,<ref name="WilliamsThreaten" /> and portions of the line were originally scheduled to open in 1976.<ref name="Branching">{{cite news |last=Vesey |first=Tom |date=December 17, 1983 |title=Metrorail, Now 7, Branching Out |newspaper=[[The_New_York_Times|New York Times]]}}</ref> However, many delays in construction led to the first Green Line stations not opening until 1991.<ref name="Schrag at p. 213" />

The downtown segment of the line was originally projected to open in September 1977.<ref name="s214">Schrag at p. 214.</ref> Obtaining approval of the District of Columbia and Prince George's County of the exact alignment of the Green Line north of U Street delayed construction. Originally, the ARS called for the line to be placed in the median strip of the planned [[North_Central_Freeway_(Washington,_D.C.)|North Central Freeway]],<ref name="s214" /> but after that road was cancelled, the route of the replacement subway tunnel became controversial, resulting in years of expensive delays.<ref>Schrag at p. 214-16.</ref>

The tunnel between the {{wmata|Gallery Place}} and {{wmata|Waterfront}} stations, including the junction with the future [[Yellow_Line_(Washington_Metro)|Yellow Line]], was built at the same time as the other Metro tunnels in downtown Washington in the early 1970s. During construction under 7th Street and U Street, where the [[Tunnel#Cut-and-cover|cut-and-cover]] technique was used, street traffic and pedestrian access on those streets was difficult.<ref>Schrag at p. 217.</ref> That led to the closure of the traditional retail businesses along the route.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

The southern section of the line was not spared from issues, however. The site of Anacostia station, set for the intersection of Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE and Good Hope Road SE, led to concerns that the station would destroy historic Old Anacostia, and after pressure from the federal government, Metro moved the site of the station to Howard Road SE.<ref name="DecadesFrustrating" />

By late 1977, Metro had pushed the opening of the Green Line to June 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title=Schedule Calls for Metro Extensions Into Maryland in November |newspaper=Washington Post |date=June 24, 1977}}</ref> Increasing construction costs and financing problems (caused primarily by the inability of local governments to contribute their share of Metro's funding) led WMATA to consider shifting the Green Line to a more southerly route, along Wheeler Road SE, to terminate near [[Rosecroft_Raceway|Rosecroft Raceway]].<ref name="Feaver" /> Another alternative would have built two Green Lines, one following Wheeler Road SE with a terminus at [[Southern_Avenue_(Washington,_D.C.)|Southern Avenue]] and the other following Suitland Parkway to Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE, proceeding northerly along Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue SE to Good Hope Road SE, and terminating at Good Hope Road SE and {{wmata|Minnesota Avenue}} SE (then called "Anacostia Station").<ref name="Feaver" />

In October 1977, WMATA's Board of Directors refused to declare construction of the Green Line a "high priority" (favoring extension of the [[Red_Line_(Washington_Metro)|Red Line]] to {{wmata|Glenmont}}) although it instructed Metro staff to work on plans to fund the line and to determine its route.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=October 28, 1977 |title=Metro Board Endorses Cheaper Glenmont Line |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Although the [[United_States_Department_of_Transportation|United States Department of Transportation]] approved the Glenmont extension, federal officials were unhappy that Metro had yet to construct the Green Line into [[Anacostia,_Washington,_D.C.|Anacostia]].<ref name="ReferenceA" />

In January 1978, a WMATA regional task force approved a Green Line route in Anacostia that followed Martin Luther King, Jr., Avenue and then Wheeler Road down to the Beltway, with a new station added near [[St._Elizabeths_Hospital|St. Elizabeths Hospital]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=January 19, 1978 |title=Anacostia Metro Shift, Greenbelt Route Rejection Backed |newspaper=Washington Post }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=May 4, 1978 |title=100-Mile Metro Backed |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Nonetheless, the Prince George's County government successfully demanded in May 1978 for WMATA to choose the Suitland Parkway to Rosecroft route instead.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=April 26, 1978 |title=P.G. Council Votes for 2 Metro Routes |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=May 10, 1978 |title=Prince George's County Council Chooses Rosecroft Metro Line |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> In August 1978, WMATA's Board of Directors recommended to the federal government and its partner state and local governments for the entire {{convert|100|mi|km|adj=on}}-long Metrorail system to be fully built, a proposal that included immediate construction of the {{wmata|Archives}}, {{wmata|Waterfront}}, {{wmata|Navy Yard–Ballpark}}, and {{wmata|Anacostia}} stations.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=August 5, 1978 |title=Cost of Subway Is Now Estimated At $6.6 Billion |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> WMATA announced in November 1978 that it had secured funding to build the Green Line from Gallery Place to Waterfront and that construction was nearly complete on that portion of the line, but that funding did not exist to push the line from Waterfront to Anacostia.<ref name="FeaverCompletion">{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=November 19, 1978 |title=Metro Completion Expected in 10 Years |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Nonetheless, Metro reiterated that it intended to complete the extension by late 1983.<ref name="FeaverCompletion" />

Two additional realignments occurred at the north end of the Green Line but with less acrimony. North of {{wmata|Fort Totten}}, the line was to have surfaced in the median of the planned North Central Freeway, [[Interstate_95_in_Maryland|I-95]], and to have proceeded to a point just west of {{wmata|Prince George's Plaza}}, with an intermediate station at [[Chillum,_Maryland|Chillum]]. I-95 and Metro would have run through the [[Anacostia_River|Northwest Branch]] Stream Valley Park, but the cancellation of I-95 through the District and out to the [[Interstate_495_(Capital_Beltway)|Beltway]] in 1974 meant that it was no longer necessary or appropriate to condemn an I-95-sized swath of parkland just for Metro. WMATA eventually selected a new route that skirted most of the park, and it was federally approved by the mid-1980s. The planned Chillum station was relocated and named {{wmata|West Hyattsville}}. The other alignment dispute occurred in the [[Petworth,_Washington,_D.C.|Petworth]] section of Washington and involved whether the tunnel would go under or skirt [[Rock_Creek_Cemetery|Rock Creek Cemetery]] and how to go through its soft-[[soil|soil]] burial ground (i) and the least disruptive way under New Hampshire Avenue from {{wmata|Georgia Avenue–Petworth}} to {{wmata|Columbia Heights}}. The tunnels eventually skirted the cemetery by using the [[New_Austrian_tunnelling_method|New Austrian tunnelling method]] and stacked under New Hampshire Avenue.

In December 1978, Metro announced that the new completion date of the Green Line past the Anacostia station to Rosecroft Raceway would be 1987, a year later than anticipated.<ref name="EisenChanges">{{cite news |last=Eisen |first=Jack |date=November 19, 1978 |title=Metro Votes Changes In Schedules and Plans |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Metro also announced that cost considerations had forced it to abandon the high-vault ceiling design for all unbuilt stations (except Navy Yard), and that a less-costly design would be used at all unbuilt Green Line stations.<ref name="EisenChanges" /> By July 1979, despite the release of billions of dollars in construction funds by the U.S. Department of Transportation, Metro had pushed back the construction of the Anacostia station to mid-1985 and the completion of the Branch Avenue extension to late 1986.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=July 12, 1979 |title=U.S. Will Release Millions in Metro Building Funds |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> But construction schedules continued to slip: despite reaffirming its construction schedules in December 1979,<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Dates Set for Subway Line Openings |newspaper=Washington Post |date=December 2, 1979}}</ref> Metro announced in January 1980 that completion of the Green Line terminus in Prince George's County would be pushed back six more months to 1987.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/128071012.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&date=Jan+26%2C+1980&author=&pub=The+Washington+Post++%281974-Current+file%29&edition=&startpage=A12&desc=.+.+.+And+Fast+Tracks+for+It |title=...And Fast Tracks for It |newspaper=Washington Post |date=January 26, 1980 |page=A12 }}</ref>

====1980年危機====
{{transh}}
Funding troubles delayed construction even further. In March 1980, Maryland officials worried that high inflation would leave Metro without enough funds to complete the Green Line, forcing Maryland to bear these construction costs alone.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=March 28, 1980 |title=Inflation, Funding Uncertainty May Slow Metro Construction |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> These fears were confirmed in part in September 1980 when Metro announced that inflation had created a $16 million shortfall in its $271 million budget.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=September 19, 1980 |title=Fiscal Woes Mounting For Metro |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> By now, Anacostia residents were increasingly angry at the repeated delays in building the Green Line. In September 1980, D.C. City Council member Jerry A. Moore, Jr. delivered a petition containing 1,000 signatures from Anacostia residents demanding that construction on the Green Line be sped up.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=September 26, 1980 |title=10-Cent Fare Rise Proposed to Cut Metro's Deficit |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

In October 1980, ''[[The_Washington_Post|The Washington Post]]'' ran a major article asking "What Ever Happened to the Green Line?" in which the newspaper concluded: "The 18.86-mile Green Line, which some argue should have been the first built because it would serve the most disadvantaged sections of the Washington area, is last on the construction list and threatened with extinction."<ref name="Whatever">{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=October 14, 1980 |title=What Ever Happened to the Green Line? |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> The article confirmed that funds were in place and contracts signed to complete the Green Line to the proposed Anacostia station at Howard Road SE and Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE, but that repeated local opposition in Maryland to the line's actual location had forced planners to delay final siting of the line inside the District of Columbia.<ref name="Whatever" /> Additionally, Maryland businessmen argued that the switch of the terminus from Branch Avenue to Rosecroft Raceway had economically harmed them, and they filed a suit in the [[United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Maryland|United States District Court for the District of Maryland]] demanding a halt to construction of the Green Line until the line's route could be again reconsidered.<ref name="Whatever" />

The District of Columbia government responded by threatening to veto any further Metro subway construction unless construction of the Green Line was made Metro's highest priority.<ref name="FeaverThreat">{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=December 12, 1980 |title=D.C. Threatens to Halt Subway Construction Over Green Line Plan |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Twenty-four hours of intense discussions later, Metro agreed to the District government's wishes.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=December 13, 1980 |title=Metro Board Agrees to Make Green Line a Top Priority |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Construction began on the Waterfront station, which was largely complete by January 1981.<ref name="DigTunnel">{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen J. |date=March 31, 1985 |title=Metro Ready To Dig Tunnel To Anacostia |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Once complete, the station was used for storage.<ref name="MetroMovestoAnacostia"/> By December 1980, Metro was still predicting that the Green Line to Anacostia would open in July 1986,<ref name="FeaverThreat" /> but in January 1981, Metro admitted that the line would not open until at least 1990 because of funding constraints.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=January 30, 1981 |title=Status of Future Metro Openings |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Two months later, Metro estimated the cost of building the Green Line from U Street NW to Anacostia at $175 million.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=March 6, 1981 |title=Metro Says $502 Million Will Be Wasted If Subway System Is Held to 62 Miles |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

Controversies regarding the siting of the Green Line continued. In May 1980, a group of business owners near the former proposed terminus at Branch Avenue and Auth Road near [[Marlow_Heights,_Maryland|Marlow Heights]] sued Metro on the grounds that the decision to change the course of the Green Line was illegal because it had been undertaken without a public hearing (in violation of Metro's rules).<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /><ref name="FeaverDOTWarns">{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=April 4, 1981 |title=DOT Warns Metro About Rosecroft Line |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> In February 1981, Judge [[Norman_Park_Ramsey|Norman Park Ramsey]] of the [[United_States_District_Court_for_the_District_of_Maryland|U.S. District for Maryland]] held that Metro did not correctly advertise the hearings at which the change would be discussed.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /><ref name="Vesey" /> Metro appealed the ruling, and Judge Ramsey did not [[Injunction|enjoin]] Metro from proceeding with construction until the appeal was resolved.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /> The Prince George's County government, however, reaffirmed in April 1981 its support for the Rosecroft Raceway terminus, and Metro promised to hold a public hearing on the issue in June 1981.<ref name="FeaverDOTWarns" /> Shortly thereafter, the civil rights office of the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter to Metro warning that the Rosecroft Raceway route could negatively impact two historically black communities nearby.<ref name="FeaverDOTWarns" /> In May 1981, Metro changed its estimate for the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia to early 1988.<ref>{{cite news |last=Feaver |first=Douglas B. |date=May 29, 1981 |title=Prognosis for Subways Is Later or Shorter |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

Prince George's County officials continued to worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations in the county ({{wmata|Southern Avenue}}, {{wmata|Naylor Road}}, {{wmata|Suitland}}, and {{wmata|Branch Avenue}}).<ref name="Burgess">{{cite news |last=Burgess |first=John |date=July 31, 1981 |title=Pr. George's Holding Up Metro Pact |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Prince George's County officials vetoed in July 1981 any further expenditure of Metro's construction funds unless Metro diverted $100 million from the [[Red_Line_(Washington_Metro)|Red Line]] extension in [[Montgomery_County,_Maryland|Montgomery County]] to {{wmata|Glenmont}} and began the immediate purchase of land and [[Right-of-way_(transportation)|rights-of-way]] in Prince George's County.<ref name="Burgess" /> Metro agreed a month later to the plan, with the provision that $90 million per year would be spent to begin work on the inner-city portion of the Green Line (the Gallery Place, Waterfront, and Navy Yard stations).<ref>{{cite news |last=Burgess |first=John |date=August 28, 1981 |title=Metro Board Recommends Starting Construction on All Lines by 1985 |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

Metro held its long-awaited hearings over the Green Line's route in October 1981, but only in Prince George's County (not the District).<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /> A month later, the [[United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Fourth_Circuit|4th Circuit Court of Appeals]] turned down Metro's appeal.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /><ref name="Vesey" /> Metro subsequently estimated on December 9, 1981, that the Green Line would reach Anacostia in late 1989.<ref name="APNursery">{{cite news |last=Komarow |first=Steven |date=December 10, 1981 |title=Congressional Nursery Threatens Subway Stall |newspaper=[[Associated_Press|Associated Press]]}}</ref>

Funding problems delayed construction even further. In February 1982, [[President_of_the_United_States|President]] [[Ronald_Reagan|Ronald Reagan]] proposed cutting Metro construction funds by 21.4% to just $295 million a year.<ref name="WilliamsThreaten">{{cite news |last=Williams |first=Juan |date=February 25, 1982 |title=Budgets, Politics Threaten Green Line |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Planned Green Line construction constituted 40.5% of Metro's construction budget, and the cuts threatened to cancel the entire Green Line.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart"/><ref name="WilliamsThreaten" /> To African American community leaders, the cuts were evidence that Metrorail was meant for suburban white commuters while inner city African Americans were relegated to taking Metrobus.<ref name="WilliamsThreaten" /> Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard station.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /> However, on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money on the construction of the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the Green Line.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /> The judge held that Metro had decided to shift the Green Line route without properly advertising the public hearings, which the transit system would now be required to hold again, delaying construction of the Green Line and Anacostia station by at least a year.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /> Although Metro had advertised the hearings, Judge Ramsey said, the advertisements contained the same wording flaws that had precipitated the Maryland lawsuit.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /> Metro subsequently scheduled new hearings for June 1982.<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" />

Metro officials considered shifting construction funds from the southern Green Line to the northern Green Line in order to start construction on that end of the line,<ref name="BurgessHaltStart" /> but the D.C.

As Metro struggled to secure construction funding for the Green Line and Anacostia station, it also struggled to lift the district court's injunction on Green Line construction.

In 1984, Metro undertook two steps to secure completion of the Green Line. First, the transit agency hired former U.S. Secretary of Transportation [[William_Thaddeus_Coleman_Jr.|William T. Coleman, Jr.]] in December 1983 to oversee negotiations with the various entities involved with the siting of the Green Line route and seek a resolution through the U.S. district court.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=December 22, 1983 |title=Metro Considers Hiring Ex-Transportation Chief To Settle Green Line Feud |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> On February 21, 1984, Prince George's County Executive [[Parris_Glendening|Parris Glendening]] announced that construction of the Green Line in Prince George's must start by September 30, 1984, or he would begin vetoing Metro spending proposals.<ref name="SeekOnTrack">{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=February 21, 1984 |title=New Moves Seek to Get Green Line on Track |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> At the same time, Metro and Coleman opened negotiations to build the Green Line from the L'Enfant Plaza Station to Anacostia.<ref name="SeekOnTrack" /><ref name="Accord">{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=February 25, 1984 |title=Tentative Accord |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref name="ClearedGreenLine" /> Advocates of the Rosecroft route, however, warned that they would sue if Metro switched back to the original route.<ref name="SeekOnTrack" />

Just four days later, Metro, D.C. and Prince George's County officials, reached an agreement with advocates of both the Branch Avenue and Rosecroft routes to begin construction from L'Enfant Plaza to Anacostia, pending resolution of the line's final route by December 6, 1984.<ref name="Accord" /><ref name="DeadlineSetDecision">{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=February 29, 1984 |title=Deadline Set for Green Line Decision |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> The agreement called for construction of the Green Line to Waterfront station in the summer, siting of the tunnel under the Anacostia River by June 28, and the holding of public hearings on the remaining route between July 18 and August 3.<ref name="DeadlineSetDecision" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=March 2, 1984 |title=Metro Board Clears Way for Start on Green Line |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> The U.S. Federal District Court approved the agreement on March 7.<ref name="ClearedGreenLine">{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=March 8, 1984 |title=Way Is Cleared For Green Line To Anacostia |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Following the ruling, Metro announced that it would build the Anacostia station on Howard Road between Martin Luther King, Jr. Avenue SE and the Anacostia Freeway, as well as a new Metro station at the Washington Navy Yard, and would open the Green Line by 1990.<ref name="ClearedGreenLine" /> Metro asked and won approval from the court to build the Navy Yard and Anacostia stations and the tunnel in June 1984.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=June 15, 1984 |title=Judge Is Asked To Ease Freeze On Green Line |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=June 27, 1984 |title=Work May Start This Year |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

Metro also began new political efforts to secure funding to complete the transit system. Initially, Reagan administration officials balked at this plan, reiterating that they would not permit Metro to build more than {{convert|76.4|mi|km}} of subway.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=February 2, 1984 |title=Curbs on Metro Expansion To Remain, DOT Chief Says |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> But in June, House and Senate committees passed legislation requiring the Reagan administration to release all funds appropriated for Metro, putting pressure on the administration to rescind its mileage limit.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=May 16, 1984 |title=House Panel Endorses Full Subway Construction |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=June 8, 1984 |title=House Panel Backs Bill To Lift Curb on Metro |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Lynton |first=Stephen T. |date=June 29, 1984 |title=Senate Committee Acts to Bar Limits on Metro and National |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

Like all Metrorail stations, Anacostia station was intended to be a major hub for Metrobus service in the area.<ref name="CreatingaBusStorm">{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Nell |date=September 4, 1991 |title=Bus Riders Creating a Storm |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> However, with the Anacostia neighborhood being the poorest<ref name="CreatingaBusStorm" /> and most transit-dependent area in the District of Columbia, changes to bus routes in the area proved highly controversial. As the opening of the Green Line to Anacostia neared, WMATA proposed halving the number of bus routes traveling between Anacostia and the [[National_Archives_and_Records_Administration#National_Archives_Building|National Archives Building]] downtown. That would force riders to take the more expensive Metrorail and require many riders to walk several blocks to their destination, rather than the "virtually door-to-door service" that they enjoyed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fehr |first=Stephen C. |date=April 10, 1991 |title=Metro Proposes Cuts in 40 Percent of Its Bus Routes |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> A total of 25 routes were changed, affecting more than 80,000 riders.<ref>Two routes were replaced with new routes; three routes were discontinued without replacement; 12 routes were consolidated with other routes; seven routes were truncated to terminate at the Anacostia station; and one route was expanded.

WMATA first became aware of a rail car shortage in 1988. Although the transit authority knew that it needed at least 98 new rail cars to provide adequate service to the new stations to be added on the Green Line and other lines by 1993, it did not place an order for the cars.<ref name="PossibleShortage">Henderson, Nell. "Metro Sees Possible Shortage Of Rail Cars Down the Line." ''Washington Post.'' June 13, 1988.</ref> Metrorail also suffered from internal squabbling over rail car design, and rail car production had historically been plagued by poor quality and [[trade_union|labor]] [[strike_action|strikes]]—both of which added to construction delays.<ref name="PossibleShortage" /> By September 1990, more frequent breakdowns in the existing, aging rail car fleet heightened the urgency to buy more cars.<ref name="ClimbAboard">Fehr, Stephen C. "Wheaton, Forest Glen to Climb Aboard Metro." ''Washington Post.''

"Metro Set to Open Van Dorn Station." ''Washington Times.''

"'Metro Groupies' Go Along For 1st Ride From Van Dorn." ''Washington Post.'' June 16, 1991.</ref> Eventually, crowding was addressed when additional cars became available by running 8-car trains.

Metro also encountered significant problems estimating the number of riders who would board the system at the Anacostia and other Green Line stations. In June 1991, WMATA estimated that just over 15,000 riders on average would board at the Waterfront, Navy Yard, and Anacostia stations.<ref>Keary, Jim. "Metro Takes the High-Price Road." ''Washington Times.'' June 25, 1991.</ref> In December 1991, when the Anacostia station opened, Metro had revised that number to 30,700 riders per day (by June 1992).<ref name="AnacostiaAwakens" /><ref name="SpecialPreview">Sisler, Peter F. "150 Anacostians Get Preview of Life With New Metro Station." ''Washington Times.''

"After Feuds, Amid Fanfare, Metro Rolls Into Anacostia." ''Washington Post.'' December 29, 1991.</ref>

Even though significant numbers of bus riders in Anacostia had switched to Metrorail by February 1992, WMATA nonetheless began running two- rather than four-car trains on the Green Line on Sundays and during slow periods in order to close a revenue shortfall.<ref name="RidershipFallShort" />

Metro finally ordered new rail cars, but the first of the cars were not due to be delivered until February 2001.<ref name="UnclogGreenLine">Layton, Lyndsey. "Metro Seeks To Unclog Green Line." ''Washington Post.'' January 25, 2001.</ref>

The January 13, 2001 opening of the final five Green Line stations (Congress Heights, Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) significantly worsened overcrowding and service problems on the line. The five new stations added almost 20,000 new riders a day, overwhelming station platforms, jamming trains to capacity, and forcing many riders at Anacostia and other stations up the line to wait as train after train passed them, filled.<ref name="RidersFeelCrunch">Layton, Lyndsey.

By January 24, the number had risen to more than 30,600 per day, three times as many as originally estimated.<ref name="UnclogGreenLine" /> Angry commuters using the Anacostia, Navy Yard, and Waterfront stations peppered the transit agency with complaints.<ref name="RidersFeelCrunch" /> WMATA claimed that a number of factors contributed to the ridership crunch: the system was experiencing record ridership; two-year-old ridership projections were used; the five stations were opened two months ahead of schedule; the five new stations were opened two months before new rail cars were ready for service; and WMATA offered free parking at the Green Line stations, which drew 12,000 rather than 4,000 riders to the line.<ref name="UnclogGreenLine" />

Beginning in 1989, WMATA sought funding to extend the Green Line beyond the Anacostia station and to operate the Green Line. Metro asked Congress to authorize $2.16 billion over 10 years to complete the {{convert|103|mi|km|adj=on}} system, as well as appropriate the remaining $193 million from the transit agency's original 1980 authorization to complete the Green Line from Anacostia to {{wmata|Branch Avenue}} and link the Green Line internally between U Street and Fort Totten.<ref>{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Nell |date=March 17, 1989 |title=$2 Billion Sought to Finish Metro |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Nell |date=May 5, 1989 |title=Area Officials on Hill Seek Full Metro Funding |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Although the [[George_H._W._Bush|Bush administration]] opposed the request,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Murray |first1=Frank J. |last2=Smith |first2=John E. |date=March 28, 1990 |title=Bush Might Veto Bill to Complete Metrorail System |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Congress provided $2.025 billion.<ref>{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Nell |date=March 29, 1990 |title=House Approves $2 Billion to Complete Metrorail System |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref><ref name="PushesMetroCloser">{{cite news |last=Fehr |first=Stephen C. |date=October 26, 1990 |title=Agreement Pushes Metro Closer to the Finish Line |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Only the stations at {{wmata|Suitland}} and Branch Avenue remained unfunded.<ref name="PushesMetroCloser"/>

By mid-1991, however, falling inflation had reduced WMATA's construction costs so much that the agency said it could build the two final Green Line stations in Prince George's County without asking Congress for additional money.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fehr |first=Stephen C. |date=June 13, 1991 |title=Metro May Be Finished on Budget, Gunn Says |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> WMATA also proposed spending money almost three times faster up-front to accelerate its construction schedule, a move which would be more than compensated for by savings in out-years.<ref>{{cite news |last=Keary |first=Jim |date=July 12, 1991 |title=Speedup Plan Proposed to Finish Metro By 2001 |newspaper=Washington Times}}</ref><ref name="EndofOdyssey">{{cite news |last=Fehr |first=Stephen C. |date=July 12, 1991 |title=Metro Eyes End of Odyssey In Year 2001 |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Prince George's County officials threatened to block all further Metrorail construction unless they received guarantees that the stations in their county would be built.<ref>{{cite news |last=Keary |first=Jim |date=July 26, 1991 |title=PG Puts Its Foot Down on Metro |newspaper=Washington Times}}</ref> Funding for the remaining seven Green Line stations in the District and Prince George's remained in doubt as of August 1991, with District officials saying that it made sense to build the {{wmata|Georgia Avenue–Petworth}} and {{wmata|Columbia Heights}} stations and Prince George's representatives demanding that the three stations in their county be completed.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fehr |first=Stephen C. |date=August 20, 1991 |title=Local Money Woes May Jeopardize Metro's Last 13 Miles |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> WMATA said that it had so little money it could not fund 16 critical small construction projects, among them security gates at the Navy Yard and Waterfront stations and parts for escalators at the seven new Green Line stations in D.C. and Prince George's County.<ref>{{cite news |last=Fehr |first=Stephen C. |date=November 8, 1991 |title=Metro Asks $20 Million For Projects |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> The funding impasse was broken in November 1991 when local and state governments agreed to roughly triple their contribution to Metro's construction costs by 1994 to complete the entire system.<ref name="EdgesTowardPactFinish">{{cite news |last=Fehr |first=Stephen C. |date=November 22, 1991 |title=Metro Edges Toward Pact to Finish Rail Line |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

The first WMATA budget which contained funds for operating the Green Line was proposed in December 1989. The budget presumed a December 1, 1990, opening for the Mt.

The opening of the Green Line was significantly delayed, however, when in May 1990 WMATA fired the contractor building the Shaw–Howard University and U Street–Cardozo stations. Mergentime/[[Tutor_Perini|Perini]] Joint Venture, the contractor working on the stations, had violated its contract with WMATA by reducing the workforce on the project, not meeting project deadlines, and permitting unsafe working conditions to persist.<ref name="PutOffUntil">{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Nell |date=May 12, 1990 |title=Green Line Opening Put Off Until Spring |newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref> Mergentime/Perini denied the accusations.<ref name="PutOffUntil" /><ref name="NearsCompletion">{{cite news |last=Keary |first=Jim |date=September 14, 1990 |title=Green Line Nears Completion |newspaper=Washington Times}}</ref> Although similar problems plagued Mergentime/Perini's work on the Navy Yard station, WMATA did not fire the joint venture company from that project.<ref name="PutOffUntil" /> WMATA said that the problems would delay the Green Line's opening until at least the late spring of 1991.<ref name="PutOffUntil" />

The cost of testing and operating the Green Line left WMATA struggling financially.

Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia station was complicated by the discovery of a potential toxic waste site in the path of the subway.

Service on the Green Line tracks began on May 11, 1991 on three stations between U Street and Gallery Place–Chinatown. Initially, all trains through this section were run as [[Yellow_Line_(Washington_Metro)|Yellow Line]] trains terminating at {{wmata|Huntington}}. The Green Line formally began on December 28, 1991, with three stations south of L'Enfant Plaza to Anacostia. At this time, Yellow Line service north of Mount Vernon Square was discontinued and those stations were served only by the new Green Line. The four-station branch north of Fort Totten to {{wmata|Greenbelt}} opened on December 11, 1993. The two segments were connected on September 18, 1999, with two stations opening, and the last five stations south to Branch Avenue opened on January 13, 2001, completing the original {{convert|101|mi|km|adj=on}} Metrorail system.<ref name="history">{{Cite web |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/upload/History-090418.pdf |title=Metro History |date=September 4, 2018 |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref>

After the branch north of Fort Totten opened, the Green Line Commuter Shortcut began as a six-month experiment on January 27, 1997, allowing passengers to get on a train on the Green Line segment during rush hours and travel as far as {{wmata|Farragut North}} on the Red Line without having to switch trains at Fort Totten; a transfer was needed during off-peak hours. This was accomplished by utilizing a single-track spur (B & E connection<!--explain-->) between the Green and Red Lines near (and bypassing) Fort Totten station. This shortcut was so well-received that it was continued until September 17, 1999, when the mid-city portion of the Green Line was completed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wmata.com/community_outreach/lunchtalk_online_chats/transcript.cfm?ChatID=184|title=Metro - Community Outreach - Lunchtalk Online Chat|publisher=WMATA|date=March 6, 2009|access-date=March 3, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227224335/http://wmata.com/community_outreach/lunchtalk_online_chats/transcript.cfm?ChatID=184|archive-date=December 27, 2010}}</ref><ref name="history" />

In 2006, WMATA board member [[Jim_Graham|Jim Graham]] and D.C. Mayor [[Anthony_A._Williams|Anthony A. Williams]] proposed re-extending Yellow Line service to {{wmata|Fort Totten}} or even to {{wmata|Greenbelt}}, which was the originally planned northern terminus for the line. Their proposal did not involve construction of any new track, because either extension would run along the same route as the existing Green Line and would thus relieve crowding on that line. Suburban members of the board initially resisted the proposal. Through a compromise that also increased service on the [[Red_Line_(Washington_Metro)|Red Line]], on April 20, 2006 the WMATA board approved a Yellow Line extension to the Fort Totten station during off-peak hours. An 18-month pilot program began on December 31, 2006, at a cost of $5.75 million to the District of Columbia.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority |date=December 26, 2006 |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/pressreleasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=3973 |title=Metro Extends Yellow Line to Fort Totten During Off-Peak Hours |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> At the end of the pilot, the program was extended<ref>{{Cite press release |url=https://www.wmata.com/about/news/pressreleasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=2160 |title=Metro Board approves budget that includes improved rail and bus service  |publisher=WMATA |date=June 26, 2008 |access-date=April 25, 2019}}</ref> and as of April 2019, is operational today.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wmata.com/schedules/timetables/index.cfm |title=Timetables |website=WMATA |access-date=April 25, 2019 |quote=** Yellow Line trains operate between Huntington & Mt Vernon Sq Monday through Friday from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. and between Huntington and Fort Totten from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. to close Monday through Friday, all day Saturday and all day Sunday.}}</ref>

Since the 1980s, Southeast D.C. has had one of the highest crime rates in the District of Columbia (albeit not the highest rates in all categories of crimes).<ref>Banks, p. 87; Edleson and Lindroth, p. 169; [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/01/AR2009030102049.html Labbé-DeBose, Theola. "Homicide Increases East of Anacostia."] ''Washington Post.'' March 2, 2009.</ref> Concern about crime at the Anacostia, Congress Heights, Southern Avenue, and Naylor Road Metro Stations have existed for many years although statistics only partially support those concerns. Fear of crime was one of the reasons for a 1991 fight by Prince George's County residents against bus route changes that would have forced riders to disembark at Anacostia Station.<ref name="MetroMovestoAnacostia" />

In its first year of operation, Anacostia tied with the [[Capitol_Heights_station|Capitol Heights station]] for the most auto thefts (17) at any Metro station and accounted for 11.3 percent of all auto thefts at Metrorail stations.<ref>Shaffer, Ron. "Car Theft Preys On Metro Rider's Peace of Mind." ''Washington Post.'' February 5, 1998.</ref> By 2005, large crowds of [[Middle_school|middle]] and [[Secondary_school|high school]] students began congregating at the Anacostia Station, brawled and robbed Metro riders, and created a public safety issue.<ref name="TurfWars">Emerling, Gary. "Turf Wars Plague Charter Students." ''Washington Times.'' November 28, 2005.</ref> [[Metro_Transit_Police_Department|Metro Transit Police]] officers, some accompanied by [[Police_dog|dogs]], began patrolling Anacostia, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and three other Metro stations to increase awareness of police presence in the stations and deter crime.<ref>"Regional Briefing." ''Washington Post.'' July 7, 2006.</ref>

The police presence did not appear to help since between 2002 and 2006, arrests of juveniles on Metro increased from 156 to 295, and warnings increased by 40%.<ref name="UnrulyStudents">Sun, Lena H. "Metro Has A Lesson For Unruly Students." ''Washington Post.'' March 21, 2007.</ref> Nearly half the arrests occurred at just five stations, with all but one on the Green Line: Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue.<ref name="UnrulyStudents" /> Metro created a special unit to focus on juvenile crime on Metro, and established liaisons at all D.C. public schools to feed intelligence and information about pending problems to Metro's police division.<ref name="UnrulyStudents" />

Crime continued to be a problem at the Anacostia Station late into the first decade of the 21st century. Assaults and shootings were more frequent at that station than at any other in the transit system.<ref name="TeenShot">Weil, Martin. "Teen Shot in Anacostia Station After Dispute." ''Washington Post.'' February 16, 2009.</ref> There were 32 robberies at the station in 2007.<ref>Sun, Lena H. "Robberies On Metro Spike 17%." ''Washington Post.'' February 7, 2008.</ref> Although Anacostia was one of the 10 Metro stations with the highest crime rate in 2007 (and the only such station on the list inside the District of Columbia), no auto thefts or auto break-ins<ref>The station has 808 all-day parking spaces. See: [http://www.wmata.com/rail/parking/parking_detail.cfm?station=85 "Parking. Anacostia Station." WMATA.com. 2011.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131065428/http://wmata.com/rail/parking/parking_detail.cfm?station=85 |date=January 31, 2010 }} Accessed June 14, 2011.</ref> were reported at the station that year.<ref>Sun, Lena H. "Most Crimes Occur At Ends of the Lines." ''Washington Post.'' April 19, 2008.</ref> To help deter crime, Metro installed outdoor security cameras at all 10 high-crime Metrorail stations in July 2008.<ref>Sun, Lena H. "D.C. to Fund Cameras at High-Crime Metro Spots." ''Washington Post.'' July 11, 2008; "Where the Security Cameras Would Go." ''Washington Post.'' July 11, 2008.</ref> In September 2008, Metro Transit Police stepped up their visibility and presence at all stations with high student ridership, including Anacostia.<ref>Sun, Lena H. "Transit Police Look At Text-Messaging." ''Washington Post.'' September 14, 2008.</ref>

Although historically, Metro has had a significantly lower crime rate than any comparable transit system in the United States, crime on Metro as a whole was rising in the late 2000s.<ref>La Vigne, p. 163-164; Albanese, p. 172.</ref> Crime on the transit system began spiking in 2008 and 2009. Robbery rose by 30% to 581 incidents in 2008, and in the first four months of 2009 rose another 28.3% to 240 robberies.<ref name="SpikeinCrime">Sun, Lena H. "Robberies Spike in Metro System." ''Washington Post.'' June 23, 2009.</ref> Crime on the Green Line continued to be high: Gallery Place–Chinatown had the most robberies of any station throughout the Metro system, followed by Anacostia (25% fewer than Gallery Place) and L'Enfant Plaza (20% fewer than Anacostia).<ref name="SpikeinCrime" /> Crime by juveniles (usually robbery or assault) also continued to be a serious issue for Metro, with more than 260 juvenile arrests in the first nine months of 2009, and Metro Transit Police continued to engage in large numbers of high-visibility patrols.<ref name="StepsUpPatrols">Alcindor, Yamiche. "Metro Steps Up Patrols After School at Troubled Spots." ''Washington Post.'' September 24, 2009.</ref> Anacostia, Fort Totten, Gallery Place–Chinatown, L'Enfant Plaza, and Minnesota Avenue continued to be trouble spots, and Metro added {{wmata|Metro Center}} to the list in 2009.<ref name="StepsUpPatrols" />
