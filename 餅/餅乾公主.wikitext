<!--==劇情==
The episode begins ''[[in_media_res|in media res]]'', with Finn, Jake, and Princess Bubblegum at the scene of a hostage situation. The perpetrator, a [[chocolate_chip_cookie|chocolate chip cookie]] named Baby-Snaps (voiced by [[Donald_Faison|Donald Faison]]) demands Bubblegum's crown in exchange for the prisoners. Jake, disguised as a milkman, and Finn, disguised as his shadow, successfully enter the building. Finn sneaks off to take care of Baby-Snaps's [[chocolate_chip|chocolate chip]] accomplices, while Jake tries to reason with the cookie.

Jake soon learns that Baby-Snaps grew up in an [[orphanage|orphanage]], and that his life changed when he first met Princess Bubblegum, due to the happiness she brought to the children. However, after a young Baby-Snaps told her that he too wanted to be a princess, she laughed at him. This in turn, caused him to resent her. Jake, sympathetic to Baby-Snaps's plight, helps him escape, although the two are pursued by the Banana Guards. Cornered on the precipice of a canyon, Baby-Snaps realizes the futility of his flight, thanks Jake, and jumps over the edge.

However, instead of dying, he is merely fragmented into several pieces. Baby-Snaps is later put back together and institutionalized. At the hospital, Finn and Jake arrive and, with the approval of Princess Bubblegum, Jake gives Baby-Snaps a grass crown so that he can be the princess of the Grasslands.

Faison later noted in an interview that his experience with ''Adventure Time'' was extremely positive; DiMaggio came and read lines with him, which Faison called "really cool because usually when you do voiceover work it's just you in a box and a director and a writer and whoever else is in another room."<ref name=examinerinterview/> He also revealed that he has received a large amount of positive feedback for his role, and that he would love to reprise his character if given the chance.<ref name=examinerinterview>{{cite web|title=Donald Faison Discusses 'Wish I Was Here,' 'Adventure Time,' and More|url=http://infoweb.newsbank.com/resources/doc/nb/news/14E4B0EE2CA29ED8?p=NewsBank|website=Houston Examiner|accessdate=October 2, 2014|date=June 6, 2014}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Likewise, the writing and production staff of ''Adventure Time'' were pleased with both Faison's performance and his amiability, with Herpich noting he was "so, so nice."<ref name=tom>Herpich, Tom (Storyboard artist). 2014.
