'''库尔特·勒温'''（'''Kurt Zadek Lewin'''，{{bd|1890年|9月9日|1947年|2月12日}}）是一位德裔美国[[心理学家|心理学家]]，他是现代[[社会心理学|社会心理学]]、[[组织心理学|组织心理学]]和[[应用心理学|应用心理学]]的创始人，常被称为“社会心理学之父”，最早研究[[群体动力学|群体动力学]]和组织发展。

==生平==
1890年9月9日，库尔特·勒温出生在德国普鲁士波森省[[莫吉尔诺|莫吉尔诺]]乡村（今属[[波兰|波兰]]）的一个[[犹太人|犹太人]]家庭。1905年，全家迁往首都[[柏林|柏林]]。1909年，他进入[[弗萊堡大学|弗萊堡大学]]学习医学，以后转入[[慕尼黑大学|慕尼黑大学]]学习[[生物学|生物学]]，1910年又转入[[柏林大学|柏林大学]]，在[[卡尔·斯图姆夫|卡尔·斯图姆夫]]的指导下，攻读心理学。当时，后来[[格式塔心理学|格式塔心理学]]的三位创始人[[马科斯·韦特墨|马科斯·韦特墨]]、[[沃尔夫冈·苛勒|沃尔夫冈·苛勒]]和[[科特·考夫卡|科特·考夫卡]]也都是斯图姆夫的学生。勒温原本应该在1914年获得博士学位，但是恰逢[[第一次世界大战|第一次世界大战]]爆发，于是他加入德国陆军作战，官至陆军中尉。由于在战争中负伤，他获得[[铁十字勋章|铁十字勋章]]。然后他回到[[柏林大学|柏林大学]]，终于获得博士学位。  

库尔特·勒温起初属于行为主义心理学学派，后来由于与[[马科斯·韦特墨|马科斯·韦特墨]]、[[沃尔夫冈·苛勒|沃尔夫冈·苛勒]]等共事，转而接受了[[格式塔心理学|格式塔心理学]]。勒温与早期的[[法兰克福学派|法兰克福学派]]有密切的联系，[[法兰克福学派|法兰克福学派]]起源于一个主要由犹太人[[马克思主义|马克思主义]]者构成的有影响的团体<!--  at [[Institute_for_Social_Research|Institute for Social Research]] in 德国 -->。1933年，[[阿道夫·希特勒|阿道夫·希特勒]]在德国掌权，学会解散，成员经英国前往美国<!-- 。同年，他遇到[[Eric_Trist|Eric Trist]], of 伦敦[[Tavistock_Clinic|Tavistock Clinic]].  Trist was impressed with 他的理论 and went on to use them in his studies on soldiers 第二次世界大战期间 -->。

1933年8月，纳粹在德国掌权以后，开始迫害[[犹太人|犹太人]]，于是库尔特·勒温移居[[美国|美国]]，在1940年成为美国公民。勒温任教于[[康奈尔大学|康奈尔大学]]以及[[爱荷华大学|爱荷华大学]]儿童福利研究工作站。1944年，他又在[[麻省理工学院|麻省理工学院]]建立了群体动力学研究中心。1946年，<!-- Lewin received a phone call from 主任 of[[Connecticut_State_Inter_Racial_Commission|Connecticut State Inter Racial Commission]] requesting help to find an effective way to combat 宗教种族偏见。He set up a workshop to conduct a 'change' experiment, which laid the foundations for what is now known as [[sensitivity_training|sensitivity training]]. In 1947, this led to the establishment of [[National_Training_Laboratories|National Training Laboratories]], at [[Bethel|Bethel]], [[Maine|Maine]].[[Carl_Rogers|Carl Rogers]]相信 sensitivity training is "perhaps the most significant social invention of this century." --> 

<!-- [[第二次世界大战|第二次世界大战]]以后，勒温专心于心理康复of former occupants of displaced persons camps with Dr [[Jacob_Fine|Jacob Fine]] at [[哈佛大学医学院|哈佛大学医学院]].  When [[Eric_Trist|Eric Trist]] and [[A_T_M_Wilson|A T M Wilson]] wrote to Lewing proposing a journal in partnership with their newly founded [[Tavistock_Institute|Tavistock Institute]] and his group at [[MIT|MIT]], Lewin agreed.The Tavistock [[Journal|Journal]][[Human_Relations|Human Relations]] was founded with two early papers by Lewin entitled "Frontiers in Group Dynamics".-->勒温任教于[[杜克大学|杜克大学]]一段时间。<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phy.duke.edu/people/HerthaSponer/RefugeeScholarsAtDukeUniversity.pdf |title=存档副本 |accessdate=2007-07-27  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613003608/http://phy.duke.edu/people/HerthaSponer/RefugeeScholarsAtDukeUniversity.pdf |archivedate=2007-06-13 }}</ref>.

勒温铸造了genidentity的概念<ref> Lewin, K. (1922). ''Der Begriff der Genese in Physik, Biologie und Entwicklungsgeschichte.'' (Lewin's Habilitationsschrift)</ref><!--  which has gained some importance in various theories of [[space-time|space-time]] and related fields. He also proposed [[Herbert_Blumer|Herbert Blumer]]'s [[Symbolic_interactionism|interactionist]] perspective of 1937 as an alternative to the [[nature_versus_nurture|nature versus nurture]] debate.  Lewin suggested that neither nature (inborn tendencies) nor nurture (how [[experience|experience]]s in [[personal_life|life]] shape individuals) alone can account for individuals' behavior and personalities, but rather that both nature and nurture interact to shape each person.  This idea was presented in the form of [[Lewin's_Equation|Lewin's Equation]] for behavior B=ƒ(''P,E'').  Prominent psychologists mentored by Kurt Lewin included [[Leon_Festinger|Leon Festinger]] (1919 - 1989), who became known for his [[cognitive_dissonance|cognitive dissonance]] theory (1956), environmental psychologist [[Roger_Barker|Roger Barker]], and [[Bluma_Zeigarnik|Bluma Zeigarnik]]. -->

1947年2月12日，他在美国马萨诸塞州的牛顿维尔因心脏病发作去世，运回家乡埋葬。

<!-- {{main|Force field analysis}} -->
<!-- 'Force field analysis is one of the most influential developments in the field of social science.  Force field analysis provides a framework for looking at the factors (''forces'') that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a [[Objective_(goal)|goal]] (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces).  The principle, developed by Kurt Lewin, is significant contribution to the fields of [[社会科学|社会科学]], [[心理学|心理学]], [[社会心理学|社会心理学]], [[organizational_development|organizational development]], [[process_management|process management]], and [[change_management|change management]].<ref>Lewin K. (1943).  Defining the "Field at a Given Time."  ''Psychological Review.''  50: 292-310.  Republished in ''Resolving Social Conflicts & Field Theory in Social Science,'' Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association, 1997.</ref> -->

<!-- == Action research == -->
<!-- {{main|Action research}}
Lewin, then a professor at MIT, first coined the term “action research” in about 1944, and it appears in his 1946 paper “Action Research and Minority Problems”.<ref>Lewin, K. (1946) Action research and minority problems. J Soc. Issues 2(4): 34-46</ref>  In that paper, he described action research as “a comparative research on the conditions and effects of various forms of social action and research leading to social action” that uses “a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of a circle of planning, action, and fact-finding about the result of the action”. -->   

<!-- == Leadership climates == -->
<!-- Lewin often characterized organizational [[management|management]] styles and [[culture|culture]]s in terms of [[leadership|leadership]] climates defined by (1) [[authoritarian|authoritarian]], (2) [[democratic|democratic]] and (3) [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire]] work environments. Authoritarian environments are characterized where the leader determines policy with techniques and steps for work tasks dictated by the leader in the [[division_of_labor|division of labor]].  The leader is not necessarily hostile but is [[aloof|aloof]] from [[participation|participation]] in work and commonly offers personal praise and criticism for the work done.  Democratic climates are characterized where policy is determined through collective processes with decisions assisted by the leader.  Before accomplishing tasks, perspectives are gained from group discussion and technical advice from a leader.  Members are given [[choice|choice]]s and [[collective|collective]]ly decide the division of labor.  [[Praise|Praise]] and [[criticism|criticism]] in such an environment are [[objective|objective]], fact minded and given by a group member without necessarily having participated extensively in the actual work. Laissez faire environments give freedom to the group for policy determination without any participation from the leader.  The leader remains uninvolved in work decisions unless asked, does not participate in the division of labor, and very infrequently gives praise. (Miner 2005: 39-40) <ref> {{cite book | last = Miner| first = J. B. |year = 2005| title = ''Organizational Behavior: Behavior 1:  Essential Theories of Motivation and Leadership''| publisher = M.E. Sharpe | location = Armonk| isbn = }}</ref> -->  

<!-- == Change process == -->
<!-- {{main|Change management}}
An early model of change developed by Lewin described change as a three-stage process. The first stage he called "unfreezing". It involved overcoming inertia and dismantling the existing "mind set". Defense mechanisms have to be bypassed. In the second stage the change occurs. This is typically a period of confusion and transition. We are aware that the old ways are being challenged but we do not have a clear picture to replace them with yet. The third and final stage he called "refreezing". The new mindset is crystallizing and one's comfort level is returning to previous levels. -->

<!-- == Lewin's equation == -->
<!-- {{main|Lewin's equation}}
'''Lewin's Equation''', B=ƒ(P,E), is a [[psychology|psychological]] equation of [[behavior|behavior]] developed by [[Kurt_Lewin|Kurt Lewin]].  It states that behavior is a [[function_(mathematics)|function]] of the [[person|person]] and his or her [[Social_environment|environment]] <ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=_cfK_miMqVQC&pg=PA119&lpg=PA119&dq=lewin's+equation&source=web&ots=vd-kAR_nJd&sig=y-mQfs8LLKq193E7xuyAUN0-hNo</ref>.  The equation is the psychologist's most well known formula in [[social_psychology|social psychology]], of which Lewin was a modern pioneer.  When first presented in Lewin's book ''Principles of Topological Psychological'', published in [[1936|1936]], it contradicted most popular theories in that it gave importance to a person's momentary situation in understanding his or her behavior, rather than relying entirely on the past. <ref>http://www.lucs.lu.se/People/Christian.Balkenius/Thesis/Chapter04.html</ref> -->
