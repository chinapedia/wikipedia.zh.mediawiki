==Countries that have banned propyphenazone==
Excerpt from [[WHO|WHO]] comments:
::''“Propyphenazone, a [[pyrazolone|pyrazolone]] derivative with [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatory]], [[analgesic|analgesic]] and [[antipyretic|antipyretic]] activity, was introduced in 1951 for the treatment of [[rheumatic_disorders|rheumatic disorders]]. As it is structurally related to aminophenazone it has been associated with severe blood [[dyscrasia|dyscrasias]]. However, it cannot be transformed into potentially carcinogenic [[nitrosamines|nitrosamines]] and has therefore been widely used as a replacement drug for [[aminophenazone|aminophenazone]]. In certain countries, products containing propyphenazone have now been restricted in their indications, whereas in others they are still available, sometimes as over-the-counter preparations.”''<ref name="Rejected">{{ cite book | title = Consolidated List of Products whose Consumption and/or Sale have been Banned, Withdrawn, Severely Restricted or not Approved by Governments, Twelfth Issue | publisher = Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the United Nations Secretariat | year = 2005 | location = New York | page = 232 | url = http://www.un.org/esa/coordination/CL12.pdf | format = pdf }}</ref>
