'''狼瘡腎炎'''({{lang|en|Lupus nephritis}})是[[紅斑性狼瘡|紅斑性狼瘡]](SLE)造成的腎臟炎症，屬於一種[[免疫系统|免疫系统]]的疾病。除了腎臟，SLE也會損害[[皮膚|皮膚]]、[[關節|關節]]、[[神經系統|神經系統]]和在體內的幾乎任何器官或系統。

==症狀和病徵==
{{seealso|腎功能|腎生理學}}

狼瘡的一般症狀包括[[顴骨疹|顴骨疹]](malar rash)、盤狀疹(discoid rash)、光敏感(photosensitivity)、口腔潰瘍(oral ulcer)、非糜爛性關節炎(nonerosive arthritis)、胸膜心包炎(pleuropericarditis)、腎疾病、神經系統的表現，以及血液疾病。

臨床上，全身性紅斑狼瘡常表現為發燒、體重減輕(100％)、關節痛(arthralgias)、滑膜炎(synovitis)、關節炎(95％)、胸膜炎(pleuritis)、心包炎(80％)、顴面部皮疹、光照性皮膚病、脫髮(75％)、貧血、白细胞减少症、血小板減少及血栓形成(50％)。

約半數的SLE病例在同一時間或其他的情況被證實為狼瘡性腎炎。腎特異性第標誌包括蛋白尿(100％)、腎病綜合徵(55％)、顆粒管(30％)、紅細胞管型(10％)、鏡檢血尿(80％)，肉眼血尿(2％)、腎功能降低(60％)、[[急进性肾小球肾炎|RPGN]](30％)、[[急性腎損傷|ARF]](Acute kidney injury)(2％)、高血壓(35％)、高鉀血症（15％)及和管狀異常(70％)。

In [[histology|histology]], stage I (minimal mesangial) disease has a normal appearance under light microscopy, but mesangial deposits are visible under [[electron_microscopy|electron microscopy]]. At this stage urinalysis is typically normal.

Stage II disease (mesangial proliferative) is noted by mesangial hypercellularity and matrix expansion. Microscopic haematuria with or without proteinuria may be seen. Hypertension, nephrotic syndrome, and acute renal insufficiency are rare at this stage.

Stage III disease (focal lupus nephritis) is indicated by sclerotic lesions involving less than 50% of the glomeruli, which can be segmental or global, and active or chronic, with endocapillary or extracapillary proliferative lesions. Under electron microscopy, subendothelial deposits are noted, and some mesangial changes may be present. Immunofluorescence reveals the so-called "Full House" stain, staining positively for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q.  Clinically, haematuria and proteinuria is present, with or without nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and elevated serum creatinine.

Stage IV lupus nephritis (diffuse proliferative) is both the most severe, and the most common subtype.  More than 50% of glomeruli are involved. Lesions can be segmental or global, and active or chronic, with endocapillary or extracapillary proliferative lesions. Under electron microscopy, subendothelial deposits are noted, and some mesangial changes may be present. Immunofluorescence reveals the so-called "Full House" stain, staining positively for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, and C1q. Clinically, haematuria and proteinuria are present, frequently with nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, hypocomplementemia, elevated anti-dsDNA titres and elevated serum creatinine.

A [[wire-loop_lesion|wire-loop lesion]] may be present in stage III and IV. This is a glomerular capillary loop with subendothelial immune complex deposition that is circumferential around the loop. Stage V is denoted by a uniformly thickened, eosinophilic basement membrane. Stage III and IV are differentiated only by the number of glomeruli involved (which is subject to inherent sample bias), but clinically the presentation and prognosis are both expected to be more severe in stage IV versus stage III.

Stage V (membranous lupus nephritis) is characterized by diffuse thickening of the glomerular capillary wall (segmentally or globally), with diffuse membrane thickening, and subepithelial deposits seen under electron microscopy. Clinically, stage V presents with signs of nephrotic syndrome. Microscopic haematuria and hypertension may also been seen. Plasma creatinine is usually normal or slightly elevated, and stage V may not present with any other clinical/serological manifestations of SLE (complement levels may be normal; anti-DNA Ab may not be detectable). Stage V also predisposes the affected individual to thrombotic complications such as renal vein thromboses or pulmonary emboli.

A final stage is usually included by most practitioners, stage VI, or '''advanced sclerosing lupus nephritis'''.  It is represented by Global sclerosis involving more than 90% of glomeruli, and represents healing of prior inflammatory injury. Active glomerulonephritis is usually not present. This stage is characterised by slowly progressive renal dysfunction, with relatively bland urine sediment. Response to immunotherapy is usually poor.

A tubuloreticular inclusion is also characteristic of lupus nephritis, and can be seen under electron microscopy in all stages. It is not diagnostic however, as it exists in other conditions. It is thought to be due to chronic interferon exposure.-->

==診斷==
狼瘡腎炎的診斷依賴於[[血液检查|血液检查]]、[[尿液分析|尿液分析]]、[[X射线|X射线]]、腎臟的[[超聲波|超聲波]]掃描，及[[腎活檢|腎活檢]](kidney biopsy)。<!--On urinalysis, a nephritic picture is found and RBC casts, RBCs and proteinuria is found.

The [[World_Health_Organization|World Health Organization]] has divided lupus nephritis into five stages based on the biopsy. This classification was defined in 1982 and revised in 1995.<ref name="pmid14747370">{{cite journal |author=Weening JJ, D'Agati VD, Schwartz MM, ''et al.'' |title=The classification of glomerulonephritis in systemic lupus erythematosus revisited |journal=J.

*Class I is [[minimal_mesangial_glomerulonephritis|minimal mesangial glomerulonephritis]] which is histologically normal on light microscopy but with mesangial deposits on electron microscopy.

*Class II is based on a finding of [[mesangial_proliferative_lupus_nephritis|mesangial proliferative lupus nephritis]].

It constitutes about 20% of cases.<ref name=agabegi2nd-table6-4/> Renal failure is rare in this form.<ref name=agabegi2nd-table6-4/>
*Class III is [[focal_proliferative_nephritis|focal proliferative nephritis]] and often successfully responds to treatment with high doses of corticosteroids. It constitutes about 25% of cases.<ref name=agabegi2nd-table6-4/> Renal failure is uncommon in this form.<ref name=agabegi2nd-table6-4/>
*Class IV is [[diffuse_proliferative_nephritis|diffuse proliferative nephritis]]. This form is mainly treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressant drugs. It constitutes about 40% of cases.<ref name=agabegi2nd-table6-4/> Renal failure is common in this form.<ref name=agabegi2nd-table6-4/>
*Class V is [[membranous_nephritis|membranous nephritis]] and is characterized by extreme edema and protein loss. It constitutes about 10% of cases.<ref name=agabegi2nd-table6-4/> Renal failure is uncommon in this form.<ref name=agabegi2nd-table6-4/>

Medicines are prescribed that decrease swelling, lower blood pressure, and decrease inflammation by suppressing the immune system: Patients may need to monitor intake of protein, sodium, and potassium. Patients with severe disease should restrict their sodium intake to 2 grams per day and limit fluid as well. Depending on the histology, renal function and degree of proteinuria, patients may require steroid therapy or chemotherapy regimens such as cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, or cyclosporine.-->

==治療==<!--
Drug regimens prescribed for lupus nephritis include [[mycophenolate_mofetil|mycophenolate mofetil]] (MMF), intravenous [[cyclophosphamide|cyclophosphamide]] with corticosteroids, and the immune suppressant [[azathioprine|azathioprine]] with [[corticosteroid|corticosteroid]]s. MMF and cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids are equally effective in achieving remission of the disease. MMF is safer than cyclophosphamide with corticosteroids, with less chance of causing ovarian failure, immune problems or hair loss. It also works better than azathioprine with corticosteroids for maintenance therapy.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Henderson | first1 = L. | last2 = Masson | first2 = P. | last3 = Craig | first3 = JC. | last4 = Flanc | first4 = RS. | last5 = Roberts | first5 = MA. | last6 = Strippoli | first6 = GF. | last7 = Webster | first7 = AC. | title = Treatment for lupus nephritis. | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = CD002922 | month = | year = 2012 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD002922.pub3 | PMID = 23235592 }}</ref>-->
