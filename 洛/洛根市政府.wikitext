'''洛根市政府'''是[[澳大利亞|澳大利亞]]昆士蘭州[[昆士蘭東南|東南部]]、統轄著[[洛根市_(昆士蘭州)|洛根市]]的[[地方政府區域|地方政府]]，地緣南北分別與[[布里斯本|布里斯本]]和[[黃金海岸_(澳大利亞)|黃金海岸]]接壤。人口排名上，洛根市是州內排名第3大城<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oesr.qld.gov.au/queensland-by-theme/demography/population/tables/erp/erp-qld-cities/index.shtml|title=(3218.0) Estimated resident population, Queensland cities, 1996 to 2006 (preliminary)|author=Australian Bureau of Statistics|date=3 October 2007|accessdate=2008-04-15|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411114126/http://www.oesr.qld.gov.au/queensland-by-theme/demography/population/tables/erp/erp-qld-cities/index.shtml|archivedate=2008年4月11日|df=}}</ref>；地緣上，與[[西斯寧緣區|西斯寧緣]]和[[紅土市|紅土]]也有接連。


==行政改革==
昆士蘭州的行政區域改-{制}-前，各地皆於2008年3月15日舉辦地方首長與民意代表的改選。洛根市方面因《[[昆士蘭州地方政府區域|行政改革報告]]》指出，變革有助於提昇經濟、交通、基礎建設效益，提高財務效率和打破地理隔閡而新納進市民78,400人。文件中，原本提議洛根市與[[紅土市|紅土市]]合併，惟由於兩地交通聯結不便、地方反對及社區對此缺乏認同，遂終止此議。 


==社會經濟==
洛根市的轄區：Springwood、Rochedale South、Underwood、Daisy Hill、Shailer Park、Cornubia與Forestdale的居民多是中產階級。Woodridge、Logan Central、Kingston、Loganlea的屋況則因較上述7區簡樸而被視為勞動階級居多；後者初期於建築完工後，租賃或以租售分期付款等方式予住戶，惟至今日已發展為「居者擁其屋」。

洛根市的[[工業區|工業區]]集中於Woodridge區之北部和東部。[[商業區|商業區]]則集中於Springwood區和Daisy Hill區的西部；團聚在洛根路（Logan Road）、太平洋高速公路（Pacific Highway ）和金士頓路（Kingston Road）的三角地段上，延伸至坎普頓路（Compton Road）。

== Transportation ==
Logan City is serviced by [[Queensland_Rail|Queensland Rail]]'s [[Beenleigh_railway_line,_Brisbane|Beenleigh]] and [[Gold_Coast_railway_line,_Queensland|Gold Coast]] railway lines.  The stations in Logan City are [[Trinder_Park_railway_station,_Brisbane|Trinder Park]], [[Woodridge_railway_station,_Brisbane|Woodridge]], [[Kingston_railway_station,_Brisbane|Kingston]], [[Loganlea_railway_station,_Brisbane|Loganlea]], [[Bethania_railway_station,_Brisbane|Bethania]], [[Edens_Landing_railway_station,_Brisbane|Edens Landing]], [[Holmview_railway_station,_Brisbane|Holmview]] and [[Beenleigh_railway_station,_Brisbane|Beenleigh]] although Gold Coast trains stop only at Beenleigh and Loganlea stations. [[Integrated_ticketing|Integrated ticketing]] was introduced in South East Queensland in 2004 through [[Translink_(Brisbane)|TransLink]] which has improved access to public transport. [[TransLink_(Brisbane)_services#Routes_540-597_.28Southern_Region_.28Logan_and_Beaudesert.29.29|TransLink bus routes]] now service most of the built-up areas of Logan City.

Logan City Bus Service is a bus operator, servicing places between Brisbane and Gold Coast at Logan City.  First operated as Greenline Bus Service, it was purchased by Clark's Bus Service in 1987.  Further development included the purchasing of Rochedale Bus Service in 1995.  The trading name of Logan City Bus Service was adopted in 2003. Logan City Bus Service operates a number of services under the TransLink banner, in which most services are based around Loganholme and Springwood Bus Stations along Pacific Motorway.  They also operate peak hour buses between Logan City and Brisbane City.

There are also disability transport services available, as well as limousines, Coach Chaters and taxi services.-->

<!--

Logan has 871 parks and reserves all with combinations of facilities. Also Logan offers plenty of active choices such as local swimming pools, sporting clubs, cycling tracks, walking tracks, little athletics, tinnie trails (self guided heritage trail), golf, basketball/volleyball parks, skate parks, bmx tracks, walking groups and go karting.

Logan City has recently been under development for new bistro areas across the region. Cinemas, shopping complexes and parks are prevalent.  Logan City has a free public Art Gallery.  The internationally successful Australian band [[Savage_Garden|Savage Garden]], who sold 25 million albums, are from Logan and so does Jodie Henry, three time gold medalist n the pool at the 2004 Olympics and world record holder.

Logan City is home to [[Souths_Logan_Magpies|Souths Logan Magpies]] rugby league team, one of the oldest existing rugby league clubs in Australia. It is also home to the [[Logan_Thunder|Logan Thunder]] [[WNBL|WNBL]] team.-->
