'''錫耶納賽馬節'''（{{lang|it|Palio di Siena}}，{{IPA-it|ˈpaːljo di ˈsjɛːna}}），於每年的7月2日以及8月16日在[[意大利|義大利]][[锡耶纳|錫耶納]]舉辦的傳統[[赛马|赛马]]。競賽時，17個[[锡耶纳分区|區]]會選出10區進行比賽，一區只能派出一名騎士。競賽規定不能使用馬鞍，騎士穿著的衣服顏色象徵他們所代表的區。在7月2號舉辦的賽馬節被稱為普罗文萨诺賽馬節（Palio di Provenzano），用來紀念[[普罗文扎诺圣母堂|普罗文萨诺的瑪丹娜]]，這是一場特別為了錫耶納的瑪麗亞獻身精神所舉辦的，作為{{Le|錫耶納三分區|Terzi (Siena)|卡莫利亞三分區}}（Terzo Camollia）的一個象徵。而8月16日舉行的賽馬節則被稱為Palio dell'Assunta，以紀念[[圣母升天|聖母瑪麗亞的升天]]。

有時候如果有特殊的事件，例如:地方週年紀念或國家型紀念活動時，被認為是與活動密切相關的城市可能會決定在5月至9月之間舉辦一個非凡的賽馬節。而最近一次的特殊活動舉辦在2000年，以慶祝新世紀的到來。

在比賽前夕舉辦的{{tsl|en|Corteo Storico||Corteo Storico}}是{{tsl|en|Medieval pageant||一個盛大的遊行}}，他吸引了來自世界各地的遊客和觀眾。

比賽時，騎師骑坐无鞍墊的马，在[[田野廣場|田野廣場]]進行比賽，廣場上鋪了一層厚厚的泥土。比賽需要跑廣場的三圈，通常賽程不超過90秒。而因為在廣場上常有危險的彎道，所以經常可以看到騎手被甩出賽道，但是，无鞍墊的马在沒有他們的騎手的情況下，獨自完成比賽的情況並不罕見。
 
== 歷史 ==

=== 起源 ===
中世紀起，錫耶納在城鎮中心的廣場進行各種競賽。如多人[[拳击|拳擊]]（''pugna''）、[[马上长矛比武|馬術]]、[[鬥牛|鬥牛]]（16世紀起）等多人競賽。 14世紀起，城市開始有[[锡耶纳分区|分區]]參賽的慣例，這類在錫耶納境內舉行的大型競賽開始有''[[palii_alla_lunga|palii alla lunga]]''的名稱。比賽之盛大，往往擴及整個城市。

1590年[[托斯卡纳统治者列表|托斯卡尼大公]]立法禁止[[鬥牛|鬥牛賽]]，因此各分區改在[[田野广场|田野廣場]]舉行其他非鬥牛的競賽。一開始是[[水牛|水牛賽]]（''bufalate''），後來改為[[驢|賽驢]]（''asinate''）, 此時其他地方已開始有賽馬活動出現。1633年始開始有我們現在看到的賽馬（義大利文稱''palio alla tonda''，有別於早期的''palii alla lunga''）。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilpalio.org/vittorie1633-1691.htm|title=The Palio Horse Race - All the victories at the Palio di Siena from 1633 to 1691|accessdate=15 September 2016|date=|publisher=Ilpalio.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420182210/http://www.ilpalio.org/vittorie1633-1691.htm|archive-date=2017-04-20|dead-url=no}}</ref>

=== 八月賽馬節 ===
一開始，每年只在七月二號舉行一次賽馬。1701年起，第二場賽馬節才偶爾在8月16號舉行。由於8月16號恰逢[[聖母升天節|聖母升天節]]，因此第二場賽馬節常常被自動歸類為聖母升天節的慶典之一。而之所以會訂在8月16日是因為8月14和15號已經被廣泛認定為{{tsl|it|Processione dei Ceri||聖安東尼日}}。

八月賽馬節一開始僅作為七月賽馬節的延伸。八月賽馬節通常由七月勝利的分區出資舉行（若該區負擔得起）。1802年後，八月賽馬節改由整個城市出資舉行，不再由分區獨力承擔，八月賽馬節正式成為年年都有的節日。

第一場八月賽馬節舉辦於1581年8月15日。<sup>[''[[Wikipedia:来源请求|citation needed]]'']</sup>

=== 法令限制 ===

1792年，來自[[慕尼黑|慕尼黑]]的執政者{{tsl|en|Duchess Violante Beatrice of Bavaria|巴伐利亞公爵夫人薇奧蘭特·比亞特麗斯|巴伐利亞的薇奧蘭特}}首次替錫耶納的17個分區訂定了正式的劃分界線；同時還整併了部分分區，將整個錫耶納的分區數縮減為17個。鑑於往年競賽中發生的意外，法令於同年規定最多十個分區參賽。

每一場比賽中, 十七分區中只有十個分區參與：去年未參賽的七個分區，其餘三隊則為抽籤決定。<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilpalio.siena.it/ |title=Archivio del Palio di Siena |publisher=Il Palio.Siena .it |date= |accessdate=19 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223073947/http://www.ilpalio.siena.it/ |archive-date=2014-12-23 |dead-url=no }}</ref>

== 現今的比賽 ==

第一場比賽於7月2日舉行，既是[[聖母訪親|聖母訪親]]盛宴，也是當地節日[[普羅旺茲諾麥當娜|普羅旺斯諾麥當娜]]的日期。第二場比賽是8月16日舉行的，是[[馬利亞(耶穌的母親)|聖母]]盛宴之後的第二場比賽。在特殊事件（例如，[[阿波罗11号|阿波羅11號]]登陸）和重要紀念日（例如[[意大利統一|義大利統一]]百週年）之後，西南社區可能決定在5月至9月期間舉行第三次比賽。最近一次是在千禧年（西元2000年）。

比賽僅有十個隊伍，所以並非所有分區皆能上場比賽。去年未參賽的七個分區將優先進入比賽名單，再用抽籤決定其餘三隊。（每年有兩次，分別於五月底及七月初）。
在預備賽結束一年後，私人業主（其中包括一些騎師）為義大利其他賽馬節提供馬廄以供挑選並聘請獸醫為馬匹檢查身體狀況，於比賽前三天決定十個規模相等的馬廄，並以[[彩票|彩票]]決定哪一批馬代表其分區出賽。將會舉辦六場預備賽用以選擇馬匹，第一場將於傍晚舉行，最後一場則結束於賽馬節開始前的早晨。比賽期間經常生[[賄賂|賄賂]]的情形，促使各分區的選手走會密切注意對手的一舉一動。僅允許雜種馬上場比賽，不能使用純種馬。<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ilpalio.org/palioenglish3.htm |title=The Palio Horse Race - Commonly Asked Questions Regarding The Horses |publisher=Ilpalio.org |date= |accessdate=19 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412192731/http://www.ilpalio.org/palioenglish3.htm |archive-date=2017-04-12 |dead-url=no }}</ref>

The race is preceded by a spectacular pageant, the {{tsl|en|Corteo Storico||Corteo Storico}}, which includes (among many others) ''Alfieri'', flag wavers, in medieval costumes. Just before the pageant, a squad of ''[[卡賓槍騎兵|carabinieri]]'' on horseback, wielding swords, demonstrate a mounted {{tsl|en|charge (warfare)||charge}} around the track. They take one lap at a walk, in formation, and a second at a gallop that foreshadows the excitement of the race to come, before exiting down one of the streets that leads out of Piazza del Campo. Spectators arrive early in the morning, eventually filling the centre of the town square, inside the track, to capacity; the local police seal the entrances once the festivities begin in earnest. Seats ranging from simple {{tsl|en|bleacher||bleacher}}s to elaborate {{tsl|en|box (theatre)||box seats}} may be had for a price, but sell out long before the day of the race.

在比賽之前有個壯觀的盛會，{{tsl|en|Corteo Storico||古裝遊行}}，其中包括（在許多其他人中）Alfieri，旗幟揮舞，在中世紀的服裝。 就在賽前，卡賓槍騎兵隊揮舞著劍，在賽道周圍表演衝鋒。 他們步行一圈，形成一秒鐘，另外一個賽道，預示著比賽的興奮，然後退出了出自Piazza del Campo的一條街道。 觀眾清晨到達，最終填補了城市廣場的中心，在軌道內，容納; 一旦慶祝活動開始，當地警方就會密封入口。 從簡單的長椅到精心製作的座椅座椅的座位可能有一個價格，但在比賽當天很久才賣出。
 
七月賽馬節的下午七點半及八月賽馬節的下午七點，爆炸聲響徹整個廣場，向成千上萬的圍觀者通報了比賽即將開始。比賽將會繞著[[田野廣場|田野廣場]]奔跑三圈，the perimeter of which is covered with several inches of dirt and [[凝灰岩|tuff]]<!--NOT TUFA!!!--> (imported and laid for the occasion at great expense to the city) and the corners of which are protected with padded crash barriers for the occasion. The jockeys ride the horses bareback from the starting line, an area between two ropes. Nine horses, in an order only decided by lot immediately before the race starts, enter the space. The tenth, the ''rincorsa'', waits outside. When the ''rincorsa'' finally enters the space between the ropes the starter (''mossiere'') activates a mechanism that instantly drops the ''canapo'' (the front rope). This process (the ''mossa'') can take a very long time, as deals have usually been made between various ''contrade'' and jockeys that affect when the ''rincorsa'' moves - he may be waiting for a particular other horse to be well- or badly-placed, for example.

在危險的，陡峭的斜坡軌道上，騎士被允許使用他們的鞭子（義大利語， nerbi，拉伸的，乾公牛皮）不僅為自己的馬，而且為了擾亂其他馬和騎士。事實上，是由代表他的對手的馬贏得的，而不是騎師。 獲勝者是穿過終點線的第一匹馬 - 一匹馬可以沒有騎手贏得勝利（一種被稱為cavallo scosso的條件）。 一匹馬也可以沒有它的裝飾頭飾（spennacchiera），雖然相反的信念也被廣泛地持有，甚至在塞內加爾人之間。 比賽中的失敗者被認為是馬匹是第二，而不是最後的對手。

{{TransH}}

The winner is awarded a banner of painted silk, or ''palio'', which is hand-painted by a different artist for each race. The enthusiasm after the victory, however, is so extreme that the ceremony of attribution of the ''palio'' is quite instantaneous, being the first moment of a months-long celebration for the winning ward. There are occasional outbreaks of violence between partisans of rival ''contrade''.

There may be some danger to spectators from the sheer number of people in attendance. There have also been complaints about mistreatment of horses, injuries and even deaths, especially from animal-rights associations and even from some [[兽医|veterinarian]]s. In the Palio held on 16 August 2004, the horse for the ''contrada'' of Bruco (the Caterpillar) fell and was badly trampled, as the race was not stopped despite possible additional safety risks for other horses. The horse died of its injuries, raising further complaints from animal-rights organizations.

The Palio differs from "normal" horse races in that part of the game is for the wards to prevent rival ''contrade'' from winning. When a ''contrada'' fails to win, its historical enemy will celebrate that fact nearly as merrily as a victory of its own, regardless of whether adversarial interference was a deciding factor. Few things are forbidden to the jockeys during the race; for instance, they can pull or shove their fellows, hit the horses and each other, or try to hamper other horses at the start.

The most successful ward is Oca, the Goose, which has won 63 races (at least according to their records, which start from 1644), followed by Chiocciola, the Snail, with 51, and Tartuca, the Tortoise, with 46. Oca is also the ''contrada'' with the most wins in recent history (from 1900 to 2010) with 21 victories, followed by Selva, the Forest, with 18, and Drago, the Dragon, with 17.

Among jockeys, the most victorious of all time is {{tsl|en|Andrea Degortes||Andrea Degortes}}, nicknamed ''Aceto'' ('Vinegar'), with 14 wins (from 1964 to 1996). Angelo Meloni, nicknamed ''Picino'' (active from 1897 to 1933) has the second in the number of wins with 13 successes, and Luigi Bruschelli, nicknamed ''{{tsl|en|Luigi Bruschelli||Trecciolino}}'' (still active), has the third most of 12 wins (although he claims 13 victories, his horse won without him one year).

The most successful horses were Folco and Panezio with eight wins each, followed by Topolone with seven.

In recent history (from 1900 to the present), only three wards have ever succeeded in winning both the July and the August races in a single year (the term in Italian is ''fare cappotto'').  Tartuca (the Tortoise) accomplished the feat in 1933, while Giraffa (the Giraffe) won both races in 1997, with jockey Giuseppe Pes, nicknamed ''Il Pesse''.  In 2016, jockey Jonatan Bartoletti, on the mount "Preziosa Penelope", won both the July and August races for Lupa (the She-wolf).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sienafree.it/palio-e-contrade/palio/83048-palio-di-siena-del-16-agosto-2016-trionfa-incredibilmente-la-lupa-e-cappotto- |title=存档副本 |access-date=2017-04-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331214436/http://www.sienafree.it/palio-e-contrade/palio/83048-palio-di-siena-del-16-agosto-2016-trionfa-incredibilmente-la-lupa-e-cappotto- |archive-date=2017-03-31 |dead-url=no }}</ref>

==Ritual and rivalry==
The ''Palio di Siena'' is more than a simple horse race. It is the culmination of ongoing rivalry and competition between the ''contrade''. The lead-up and the day of the race are invested with passion and pride. Formal and informal rituals take place as the day proceeds, with each ''contrada'' navigating a strategy of horsemanship, alliances and animosities. There are the final clandestine meetings among the heads of the ''contrade'' and then between them and the jockeys.<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref> There is the two-hour pageant of the ''Corteo Storico'', and then all this is crowned by the race, which takes only about 75 seconds to complete. Although there is great public spectacle, the passions displayed are still very real.

The ''contrada'' that has been the longest without a victory is nicknamed ''nonna'' ('grandmother').  Civetta (the Owlet) had the title from 1979 until 2009, when it won 16 August race. Torre (the Tower) had this title for being without victory for 44 years (from 1961 to 2005), and Bruco (the Caterpillar) held the title for not winning over 41 years (from 1955 to 1996). Last ''nonna'' was Lupa (the She-Wolf), which has not had a victory since 2 July 1989, a period of {{Age in years|1989}} years, until July 2016, when it finally won, leaving now the ''nonna'' title to Aquila (the Eagle).

==Palio (Drappellone)==
[[File:Drappellone.jpg|thumb]]
The ''drappellone'' ("banner"), or ''palio'', known affectionately as "the rag" in Siena, is the trophy that is to be delivered to the ''contrada'' that wins the Palio.

The ''palio'' is an elongated rectangular piece of silk, hand-painted by an artist for the occasion. It is held vertically on a black-and-white shaft halberd and topped by a silver plate, with two white and black plumes draped down the sides.

The ''palio'', along with the plumes, remains the property of the ''contrada''. The plate is returned to the city of Siena before the two Palii of the following year, after the date and the name of the victorious ''contrada'' are inscribed on its back. There is one silver platter for the Palio in July and another for the August Palio. The plates are replaced approximately every ten years.

The value of the banner is unique, because it represents a particular historical period of the city of Siena. The ''palii'' often reflect the symbols of the various governments that have presided at various times, including the crest of the grand duchy of Lorraine, the crest of the [[托斯卡纳统治者列表|Grand Dukes of Tuscany]], the crest of the [[薩丁尼亞王國|Kingdom of Savoy]] of Italy, symbols from [[意大利王國_(1861年–1946年)|Fascist Italy]], and most recently, imagery of the [[意大利|Republic]].

The process that an artist should follow in designing the ''palio'' is rigid: it must follow a precise iconography that includes some sacred symbols, as the July Palio is dedicated to the Madonna of Provenzano, and that of August to the Madonna of the Assumption. It must present the insignia of the city, those of the third part of the city,<ref>[[Terzi_(Siena)|Terzi (Siena)]]</ref> and the symbols or colors of the ten ''contrade'' participating in the race. There are, however, no limits regarding the style of the art. The ''palio'' is first presented at a press conference in the courtyard of the Podestà of the City Hall about a week before the race.

== The Palio runs throughout the year ==
[[File:Contradaioli_lg_tempodipalio147_nit.jpg|thumb]] on stage singing]]
Although many activities take place within each ''contrada'', the organization of the Palio is still the largest, since it is not just in two races each year. Each time, the festival itself runs for four days of events, the preparation for which lasts all year.

Beginning in early winter, the contrada leaders talk and develop strategies, making contacts with the jockeys and horse owners. These leaders prepare those who will race in the Piazza del Campo or take part in minor Palios elsewhere in nearby towns (''la cosiddetta provincia'') and bring them to training courses organized by the city in the spring.

The full activities of the Palio start to grow in momentum towards the end of May, with the drawing of lots of the three remaining ''contrade'' that will join the seven that have won the right to race. With districts and teams outlined, ''contrade'' begin to talk about "deals" (engagement of jockeys) and "parties" (secret pacts for the win), despite not knowing which horse they will draw in the lot.

About a week before the race, the ''palio'' (''drappellone'') itself is presented to the city, which has commissioned a local artist (in the case of the Palio of July) or internationally recognized artist (in the case of the Palio of August or a special Palio) to create the prize. Also at this time, visits occur to the horses which will be presented for the lottery.

In the first of the four days of the festival, the lottery is held to select which ''barbero'' (the term for "racehorse" in the city of Siena and [[托斯卡纳大区|Tuscany]]) will go to which contrada. The stone race track around the square is covered with a layer of dirt composed of a mixture of [[凝灰岩|tuff]], [[黏土|clay]] and [[沙|sand]]. Six trials are run, during which the riders have the opportunity to familiarize themselves with their horse and with the track itself, its sounds and rhythms of the race. Although the trials are attended by many tourists and ''contrada'' members in square, barriers are mounted on the outside of the track.

Among the events that mark the approach of the Palio are the rehearsal dinner, the "mass" of the jockeys and the blessing of the horse and jockey.

== Extraordinary Palios ==
An extraordinary Palio is a third Palio which may take place during the period between May and September and is associated with events or anniversaries of major importance for the community of Siena. The last extraordinary Palio coincided with the advent of the new millennium. It was actually held on 9 September 2000 and was won by [[锡耶纳分区|Selva (Forest)]], by jockey Giuseppe Pes riding on the horse Urban II. Prior to this, the last extraordinary Palio was held on 13 September 1986 to celebrate the centenary of the abolition of the Balia and Biccherna governments.

In earlier times, the third Palio was a way to honor distinguished guests passing through or visiting Siena. Examples are the extraordinary Palio of 7 June 1676, during the visit to Siena of the wife of Prince Don Agostino Chigi, and that of 15 June 1673 (not considered official), honouring the visit to Siena of {{tsl|en|Flavio Chigi (1631-1693)||Cardinal Flavio Chigi}}. Even the [[托斯卡纳统治者列表|Grand Duke of Tuscany]] requested another round of Palio, perhaps closer to the ordinary.

From the second half of the 19th century, extraordinary Palios began to be organized for celebration of special events, rather than illustrious visits. This was the case of a meeting of the Society of Sciences or the inauguration of important monuments (such as the inauguration of the monument to the fallen in the [[库尔塔托内|Battle of Curtatone]] and [[萨尔梅德|Montanara]], on 29 May 1893). In 1896, they even ran four Palios, both ordinary and two extraordinary. The first extraordinary race was on 16 August, which is considered extraordinary because it was requested by the citizens as the original race was moved to 25 August due to transfer from Siena's VIII Corps, and the second was on 23 September for the inauguration of the monument to [[朱塞佩·加里波底|Giuseppe Garibaldi]].

A third Palio, the "Palio of Peace", was held in 1945 by popular acclaim to celebrate the end of World War II and was won by Gioacchino Calabro riding Rubacuori su Folco, for the ''contrada'' of [[锡耶纳分区|Drago (Dragon)]]. An extraordinary Palio was held in 1969 to commemorate the conquest of the moon by the Apollo 11 mission.

The following years created the habit of running on the occasion of a centenary of particular importance. This is the case for 28 May 1950, the fifth centenary of the canonization of [[聖伯爾納定|St. Bernardine of Siena]], and 5 June 1961, the centenary of the [[意大利統一|Unification of Italy]].

==馬匹安全之爭議==
幾年來，錫耶納賽馬節一直是動物權益組織抗議活動的焦點，其中包括{{le|反活體解剖聯盟|American Anti-Vivisection Society}}。主要原因是比賽造成的跌倒經常導致了馬的死亡。

這些擔憂導致了意大利旅遊部部長在2011年阻止錫耶納賽馬節被提名為[[聯合國教科文組織|聯合國教科文組織]] [[人类非物质文化遗产代表作名录|非物質文化遺產名錄]]。<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/17/palio-siena-ban-horse-cruelty |title=存档副本 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427103600/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/apr/17/palio-siena-ban-horse-cruelty |archive-date=2017-04-27 |dead-url=no }}</ref>

根據{{le|反活體解剖聯盟|American Anti-Vivisection Society}}統計，1970至2007年共有48匹馬因錫耶納賽馬節而死亡，<ref>[http://www.lav.it/index.php?id=499 Il palio di Siena] {{Wayback|url=http://www.lav.it/index.php?id=499 |date=20130316080152 }} dossier della [[Lega_Anti_Vivisezione|Lega Anti Vivisezione]]</ref> 然而，賽馬節的支持者指出，因錫耶納賽馬節而死亡的馬匹死亡數量僅有交通事故死亡的2.05%。<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sunto.org/I%20libri%20elettronici%20di%20Sunto/Leverecifresugliinfortuni/Le%20vere%20cifre%20degli%20infortuni%20sul%20tufo.pdf |title=Sergio Profeti, Le vere cifre degli infortuni sul tufo, Ed.Sunto, 2004 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=19 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312222523/http://www.sunto.org/I%20libri%20elettronici%20di%20Sunto/Leverecifresugliinfortuni/Le%20vere%20cifre%20degli%20infortuni%20sul%20tufo.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-12 |dead-url=no }}</ref> 自90年代以來，制定和執行了許多關於動物保護的規定，賽馬節的支持者強調自那時以來，馬匹受傷情形已經大大減少。

近幾十年來，錫耶納市採取了一系列措施，確保馬匹（和騎手）在比賽進行期間的安危，但這些措施仍然被一些動物福利團體判斷不足，他們繼續要求廢除比賽，所採取的措施包括：
*由市議會任命的由兩名外科醫生強制進行健康檢查<ref>cf. Regulation of the Palio (Chapter IV – The submission, selection and award lots of horses) Article 37: ''The horses to be presented must, in the days immediately preceding the question on the written request of owners, undergo a visit by a Veterinary Commission, which must express opinion on health at the races in "Campo".''</ref>。
* 於1999年5月引入化學血清分析技術，以確保無使用興奮劑和抑製劑和局部麻醉劑管理物質<ref>cf. Regulation of the Palio (Cap.V, testing and racing jockeys) .57 Article: It is prohibited to administer their peers in any way, intoxicating, practice clutches of any kind, or apply "Perette.''</ref>。
{{TransH}}
* Approval in 1999 the "Protocol for the provision of incentives for the maintenance of the Palio horse" and the establishment of the register of horses trained to run. A register of farmers was introduced in 2004, instead of half blood Arabian horses (deemed physically fit to travel) and a register of barriers<ref>This project aims to achieve: the accreditation of the owners, after verification of appropriate conditions, the selection of horses with common features of the biometric considered optimal for the commitment to be addressed; training of subjects in competitions and training courses to order to optimize the preparation and adaptability to the location of the Palio, the implementation of a system of economic incentives for owners to address the purchase and breeding of horses with shared characteristics, the constant monitoring of animals by veterinarians being the Regulatory Commission Technical Hall.
