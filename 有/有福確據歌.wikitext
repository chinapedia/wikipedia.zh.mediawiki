'''第1段'''<br>

由圣灵重生，作神后嗣。<br>

:这是我见证，是我诗歌，<br>
:赞美我救主，终日欢乐！<br>

'''第2段'''<br>
完全的顺服，完全甘甜，<br>
被提的景象，显在眼前；<br>
似乎有声音，从天而来，<br>
细说主怜悯，柔述主爱。<br>

'''（副歌）'''<br>

'''第3段'''<br>
完全的顺服，完全安息，<br>
与主时交通，何等福气；<br>

=== 英语 ===
'''vs.1'''<br>
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!<br>
O what a foretaste of glory divine!<br>
Heir of salvation, purchase of God, <br>
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.<br>

'''Refrain:'''<br>
''This is my story, this is my song, <br>
''praising my Savior all the day long; <br>''
''this is my story, this is my song, <br>''
''praising my Savior all the day long. <br>''

'''vs.2'''<br>
Perfect submission, perfect delight! <br>
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight; <br>
Angels descending bring from above <br>
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love. <br>

'''(Refrain)'''<br>

'''vs.3'''<br>
Perfect submission, all is at rest! <br>
I in my Savior am happy and blest, <br>
Watching and waiting, looking above, <br>
Filled with his goodness, lost in His love. <br>
'''(Refrain)'''<br>
