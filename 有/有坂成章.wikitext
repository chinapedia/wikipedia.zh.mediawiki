1897年, Arisaka completed work on the [[Type_30_Rifle|Type 30 Rifle]], an improvement on the Murata Rifle, which was adopted by the Japanese Army as its standard weapon in time for the [[Boxer_Rebellion|Boxer Rebellion]].<ref>Bishop, ''The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II''</ref> In 1898, he also completed design work on the [[Type_31_75mm_Mountain_Gun|Type 31 75mm Mountain Gun]], and his name became known in the world of [[artillery|artillery]] as well as [[small_arms|small arms]]. However, his earlier designs were not well received by combat troops. The Type 30 Rifle was regarded as underpowered and lacked lethality. The Type 31 guns lacked [[recoil_buffer|recoil buffer]]s and had poor accuracy. 

In 1903, Arisaka was appointed head of the Army Technical Bureau. He oversaw a committee charged with improving older models, including the Type 30 Rifle. The chief designer on the project was Captain [[Kijirō_Nambu|Nambu Kijirō]], who would later attain fame as a weapons designer on his own. The result of this project was the famous [[Type_38_Rifle|Type 38 Rifle]], otherwise known as the “Arisaka Rifle”, which was issued to front line [[infantry|infantry]] troops just in time for the end of the [[Russo-Japanese_War|Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905.<ref>[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BQY/is_5_50/ai_114283920] Japan's Intriguing Arisakas</ref> The ruggedness of the Type 38 rifle was praised by combat troops, although the issue of its small caliber was not addressed until much later.<ref>Mayer. ''The Rise and Fall of Imperial Japan''. pp44-45</ref> The Type 38 Rifle, and its various modified versions, continued to be used by the Japanese military until the end of [[World_War_II|World War II]].

Throughout the Russo-Japanese War, Arisaka continued to work on improvements and variations to his rifles, and at the request of [[Imperial_Japanese_Army_General_Staff|Chief of the General Staff]] [[Yamagata_Aritomo|Yamagata Aritomo]], he also worked on designs for large [[caliber|caliber]] siege weapons and fortress guns{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}. In 1906, Arisaka was awarded with the [[Order_of_the_Golden_Kite|Order of the Golden Kite]] (2nd Class) and promoted to [[lieutenant_general|lieutenant general]]. In 1907, he was further elevated to the ''[[kazoku|kazoku]]'' peerage when he was made a [[baron|baron]] (''danshaku''). In 1910, he was awarded with the [[Order_of_the_Sacred_Treasure|Order of the Sacred Treasure]] (1st class).

Arisaka died in 1915, and his grave is at the [[Yanaka_Cemetery|Yanaka Cemetery]] in Tokyo.
