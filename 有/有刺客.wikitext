<!--==劇情==
While spending time with Flame Princess (voiced by [[Jessica_DiCicco|Jessica DiCicco]]), Finn and Jake learn that she misses her scented candles, which she left in the Fire Kingdom. The duo volunteer to retrieve them, but Flame Princess tells them to be careful and watch out for her evil father, Flame King (voiced by [[Keith_David|Keith David]]). Once they enter the Flame Kingdom, Finn and Jake manage to acquire the candles, but hear a conspiracy to assassinate the king between two fire beings, one of whom has an untied shoe, and the other has a hissy voice.

Finn and Jake traverse the Flame Kingdom palace, trying to identify the culprits. Eventually, Jake gets the idea to dress up as actors and perform a play wherein they pretend to be the conspirators; this will cause the real assassins to act suspicious. Their plan goes awry, and Flame King believes them to be the actual assassins. However, by a lucky turn of events, Finn and Jake are able to unveil the actual culprits, who are the children of Flame King's brother, whom he murdered to acquire the throne. Finn is concerned that, because her father is truly evil, Flame Princess might be evil as well, but Flame King notes that someone with a good spirit could change her.

==Production==
"Ignition Point" was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Ignition Point| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Somvilay Xayaphone & Bert Youn (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=September 17, 2012| season = 4 | number = 22}}</ref> The origin for the episode was from a writers game. The impetus had been pitched by Herpich, who was interested in "political intrigue in the Fire Kingdom".<ref name=tomignition/> Originally, he wanted to base it tonally on ''[[Game_of_Thrones|Game of Thrones]]'', but the ending episode came out more Shakespearean.<ref name=tomignition>Herpich, Tom (Storyboard artist). 2014.
