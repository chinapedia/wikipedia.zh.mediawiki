'''槲叶环'''（{{lang-la|corona civica}}）是一种以[[橡树|橡树叶]]编织而成的花冠状头冠，它在[[古罗马|古罗马]]时代是公民能獲得的次高[[軍事勳章|軍事勳章]]，僅次於[[禾草環|禾草環]]。它被颁授于那些以实際行动拯救同袍于危难中的罗马公民。<ref name=Pliny16.5>{{cite book|author=Pliny|authorlink=Pliny the Elder|coauthors=H.

<!--After [[Lucius_Cornelius_Sulla|Sulla]]'s constitutional reforms, any recipient of the Civic Crown was entitled entry into the [[Senate|Senate]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}} Furthermore, the recipient was required by law to wear his crown at every public gathering, and was applauded even by men much senior to himself. It later became a prerogative for [[Roman_Emperor|Roman Emperor]]s to be awarded the Civic Crown (originating with Augustus, who was awarded it for saving the lives of citizens by ending the series of civil wars). Famous recipients include [[Julius_Caesar|Julius Caesar]] and [[Caesar_Augustus|Caesar Augustus]].

[[Pliny_the_Elder|Pliny]] wrote about the Civic Crown at some length in ''[[Pliny's_Natural_History|Naturalis Historia]]'':

:''Nor is the same honour any greater if the rescued person is a general, because the founders of this institution wished the honour to be supreme in the case of any citizen. The receiver of the wreath may wear it for the rest of his life; when he appears at the games it is the custom for even the senate always to rise at his entrance, and he has the right to sit next to the senators; and he himself and his father and his paternal grandfather are exempt from all public duties. Siccius Dentatus, as we have mentioned at the proper place, won fourteen Civic Wreaths, and Capitolinus six, one in his case being actually for saving the life of his commanding officer Servilius. [[Scipio_Africanus|Scipio Africanus]] refused to accept a wreath for rescuing his father at the Trebbia.<ref>It was not actually the [[Battle_of_Trebia|Battle of Trebia]] but the [[Battle_of_Ticinus|Battle of Ticinus]]. Roman writers often found the events of Roman history as confusing as moderns do; however, it is not clear what Pliny meant by "Trebia." The honor was offered in camp at [[Piacenza|Piacenza]], which is near the [[Trebbia|Trebbia]] river.</ref> How worthy of eternity is a national character that rewarded exploits so distinguished with honour only, and whereas it enhanced the value of its other wreaths with gold, refused to allow the rescue of a citizen to be a thing of price, thus loudly proclaiming that it is wrong even to save the life of a human being for the sake of gain!''<ref name=Pliny16.5/>-->
