《'''雅各福音書'''》（{{lang-en|Gospel of James}}），又被稱為《雅各原始福音書》或《首卷福音書》（{{lang|en|Protoevangelium of James}}，也就是{{lang|en|Infancy Gospel of James}}），是基督教[[新約|新約]][[偽典|偽經]]之一，寫作年代大約在西元150年左右，作者題為[[公義者雅各|公義者雅各]]。它的內容記錄了[[瑪麗亞|瑪麗亞]]、他的丈夫約瑟，以及約瑟之子約書亞(耶穌)在幼年時的事蹟。

它最大的特色在於強調母親瑪麗亞的童貞無瑕，並將她視為第二個[[夏娃|夏娃]]；而耶穌的兄弟都其實是約瑟與他已離世的前妻母親瑪麗亞所生<ref name="Origen">{{cite book |author=[[俄利根|Origen of Alexandria]] |title=Origen's Commentary on Matthew in [[Ante-Nicene_Fathers|Ante-Nicene Fathers]] Volume IX |accessdate=2008-09-18 |chapter=The Brethren of Jesus |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf09.xvi.ii.iii.xvii.html |quote=But some say, basing it on a tradition in the Gospel according to Peter, as it is entitled, or "The Book of James,"  that the brethren of Jesus were sons of Joseph by a former wife, whom he married before Mary.  Now those who say so wish to preserve the honour of Mary in virginity to the end, so that that body of hers which was appointed to minister to the Word which said, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee," might not know intercourse with a man after that the Holy Ghost came into her and the power from on high overshadowed her.  And I think it in harmony with reason that Jesus was the first-fruit among men of the purity which consists in chastity and Mary among women; for it were not pious to ascribe to any other than to her the first-fruit of virginity.|language=en}}</ref>
