'''雅法门'''是[[耶路撒冷|耶路撒冷]]老城城墙上的一道石门，是8座[[耶路撒冷城门|耶路撒冷城门]]之一。 

雅法门外的雅法街通往[[地中海|地中海]]边[[以色列|以色列]]最大的港口城市[[特拉维夫|特拉维夫]]。在古代，这条路通往港口城市雅法，雅法就是今日特拉维夫的南部边缘。<!-- 

雅法门的老城一侧是一个小型广场te is a small square between [[Christian_Quarter|Christian]] and [[Armenian_Quarter|Armenian Quarter]]s.  The Christian Quarter is to the north, on the left, and the Armenian Quarter is to the South, on the right. Straight ahead an Arab 'shuq' (market) runs due east along a narrow street that leads to the [[Muslim_Quarter|Muslim Quarter]]. The [[Jewish_Quarter|Jewish Quarter]] is accessed by a number of streets and alleyways running off the gate square.

Running along the high city walls just to the south of the Gate is [[大卫塔|The Citadel of Jerusalem]], also referred to as the "Tower of David", a notable Jerusalem landmark that dates back to antiquity.  The current tower was built during the reign of the Ottoman sultan [[Suleiman_the_Magnificent|Suleiman the Magnificent]].

When German Kaiser [[Wilhelm_II|Wilhelm II]] visited Jerusalem, the Turkish authorities created a gap in the city's wall, in order to allow the visitor to enter the city without dismounting his horse. The act was a symbol of friendship between the two empires. In 1917, British general [[Edmund_Allenby|Edmund Allenby]] entered the Old CIty through this gate, giving a speech at the nearby Tower of David. During Israel's [[War_of_Independence|War of Independence]], Israeli forces fought hard to connect the Jewish Quarter of the Old City with western Jerusalem by controlling the Jaffa Gate. With a Jordanian victory in 1948, Israeli forces were not able to regain control of the gate until the Six Day War in 1967.

As the westernmost of the gates, it is heavily used by pedestrians and vehicles, and the plaza in front of the gate has been expanded to connect with new residential developments outside the gate. -->
