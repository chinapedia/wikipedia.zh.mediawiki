The ''Bureau du Roi'' was probably started in 1760, when the commission was formally announced. Its first designer was [[Jean_Francis_Oeben|Jean-François Oeben]], the master cabinet maker of the royal arsenal. The first step in its construction was the fabrication of an extremely detailed miniature model in wax . The full scale desk was finished in 1769 by his successor, [[Jean_Henri_Riesener|Jean Henri Riesener]], who had married Oeben's widow. Made for the new ''Cabinet du Roi'' at the [[Palace_of_Versailles|Palace of Versailles]], it was transferred to the [[Louvre|Louvre]] Museum in [[Paris|Paris]] after the [[French_Revolution|French Revolution]], but has been returned to the [[Palace_of_Versailles|Palace of Versailles]] in the 20th century where it stands again in the room where it was standing before the Revolution, i.e. the ''Cabinet intérieur du Petit Appartement'' ("Inner study of the Private Apartments"), the famous study room where kings [[Louis_XV_of_France|Louis XV]] and [[Louis_XVI_of_France|Louis XVI]] carried out their daily work, and inside which King [[Louis_XVI_of_France|Louis XVI]] took the decision to support the [[American_Revolutionary_War|American insurgents]] in 1777. Secret diplomatic papers were kept inside the secretary's secret drawers, whose only key the king always carried with him.

The desk is covered with intricate [[marquetry|marquetry]] of a wide variety of fine woods. In an oval reserve at the center of its 'public' side, away from the king himself, is the marquetry head of Silence, with forefinger to lips, a reminder of the discretion required in the king's business. Gilt-bronze moldings of plaques, statuettes, miniature busts and vases, even integral scrolling gilt-bronze candle stands, further adorn the surfaces of the desk. The original design was to have a miniature bust of [[Louis_XV_of_France|Louis XV]] on top, but it was replaced by [[Minerva|Minerva]] after his death in 1770.

Riesener later executed a simplified second version of the Bureau du Roi for Pierre-Gaspard-Marie Grimod, comte d'Orsay; today this may be seen in the [[Wallace_Collection|Wallace Collection]] in [[London|London]].
