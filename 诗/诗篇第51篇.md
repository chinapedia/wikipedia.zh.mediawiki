'''《诗篇》第51篇'''是《[[希伯来圣经|希伯来圣经]]·[[诗篇|诗篇]]》中的一篇，在原稿前说明作者是[[大卫王|大卫王]]，他与[[拔示巴|拔示巴]][[同房|同房]]以后，受到先知[[拿单|拿单]]的责备；于是作了这首痛悔的诗歌。<!--  （penitential psalms）。 -->它开始于：

:“神啊，求你按你的慈爱恩待我”

一般的基督徒都按照字面意义来理解这首诗，但是有批评却认为这首诗是由几位作者写成。

作为一首悔罪诗歌，它是[[东正教|东正教]]使用最频繁的诗歌之一（东正教将其列为第50篇）。<!-- It is typically included during the [[Eastern_Orthodox_Church#Repentance|Mystery of Repentance]] (corresponding to the [[Sacrament_of_Penance_(Catholic_Church)|sacrament of confession]]), in personal daily prayers, and many of the liturgical services. Verse 15 is recited as a preface to the [[Amidah|Amidah]], the central prayer in the [[Siddur|Jewish liturgy]].  In the [[Coptic_Church|Coptic Church]]'s [[Book_of_Hours|Book of Hours]] (the [[Agpeya|Agpeya]]), it is recited at every office throughout the day as a prayer of confession and repentence. Psalm 51 is associated with [[Ash_Wednesday|Ash Wednesday]].<ref>Psalm 51 is the Ash Wednesday reading in both the [[Revised_Common_Lectionary|Revised Common Lectionary]] and the [http://www.nccbuscc.org/nab Roman Catholic Lectionary].</ref> In Roman Catholic use, Verse 7 is traditionally sung as the priest sprinkles holy water over the congregation before Mass, in a rite known as the ''Asperges me'', the first two words of the verse in Latin. -->

<!-- The psalm's opening words in Latin, ''Miserere mei, Deus'', have led to its being called the ''Miserere''. It is often known by this name in musical settings. -->

<!-- == Musical settings ==
The Miserere was a frequently-used text in [[Roman_Catholic_Church|Catholic]] [[liturgical_music|liturgical music]] before [[Second_Vatican_Council|Vatican II]].  Most of the settings, which are often used at [[Tenebrae_(service)|Tenebrae]], are in a simple [[falsobordone|falsobordone]] style.  During the Renaissance many composers wrote settings.  The earliest known polyphonic setting, probably dating from the 1480s, is by [[Johannes_Martini|Johannes Martini]], a composer working in the [[Este|Este]] court in [[Ferrara|Ferrara]].<ref>Macey, p. 185</ref>  The extended polyphonic [[Miserere_(Josquin)|setting]] by [[Josquin_des_Prez|Josquin des Prez]], probably written in 1503/1504 in Ferrara, was likely inspired by the prison meditation ''[[Infelix_ego|Infelix ego]]'' by Girolamo Savonarola, who was burned at the stake just five years before.  Later in the 16th century [[Orlande_de_Lassus|Orlande de Lassus]] wrote an elaborate setting as part of his ''Penitential Psalms'', and [[Palestrina|Palestrina]], [[Andrea_Gabrieli|Andrea Gabrieli]], [[Giovanni_Gabrieli|Giovanni Gabrieli]], and [[Carlo_Gesualdo|Carlo Gesualdo]] also wrote settings.<ref>Caldwell, Grove</ref> [[Antonio_Vivaldi|Antonio Vivaldi]] may have written a setting or settings, but such composition(s) have been lost, with only two introductory motets remaining.

One of the best-known settings of the [[Miserere_(Allegri)|Miserere]] is the 17th century version by [[Roman_School|Roman School]] composer [[Gregorio_Allegri|Gregorio Allegri]]. According to a famous story, [[Wolfgang_Amadeus_Mozart|Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], aged only fourteen, heard the piece performed once, on April 11, 1770, and after going back to his lodging for the night was able to write out the entire score from memory.  He went back a day or two later with his draft to correct some errors.<ref> Sadie, Grove; Boorman, Grove</ref>

Modern composers who have written notable settings of the Miserere include [[Michael_Nyman|Michael Nyman]], [[Arvo_Pärt|Arvo Pärt]], and [[Henryk_Mikołaj_Górecki|Henryk Mikołaj Górecki]]. -->

# Miserere mei, Deus: secundum magnam misericordiam tuam.
# Et secundum multitudinem miserationum tuarum: dele iniquitatem meam.
# Amplius lava me ab iniquitate mea: et a peccato meo munda me.
# Quoniam iniquitatem meam ego cognosco: et peccatum meum contra me est semper.
# Tibi soli peccavi, et malum coram te feci: ut justificeris in sermonibus tuis, et vincas cum judicaris.
# Ecce enim in iniquitatibus conceptus sum: et in peccatis concepit me mater mea.
# Ecce enim veritatem dilexisti: incerta et occulta sapientiæ tuæ manifestasti mihi.
# Asperges me hyssopo, et mundabor: lavabis me, et super nivem dealbabor.
# Auditui meo dabis gaudium et lætitiam: et exsultabunt ossa humiliata.
# Averte faciem tuam a peccatis meis: et omnes iniquitates meas dele.
# Cor mundum crea in me, Deus: et spiritum rectum innova in visceribus meis.
# Ne projicias me a facie tua: et spiritum sanctum tuum ne auferas a me.
# Redde mihi lætitiam salutaris tui: et spiritu principali confirma me.
# Docebo iníquos vias tuas: et impii ad te convertentur.
# Libera me de sanguinibus, Deus, Deus salutis meæ: et exsultabit lingua mea justítiam tuam.
# Domine, labia mea aperies: et os meum annuntiabit laudem tuam.
# Quoniam si voluisses sacrificium, dedissem utique: holocaustis non delectaberis.
# Sacrifícium Deo spiritus contribulatus: cor contritum et humiliatum, Deus, non despicies.
# Benigne fac, Domine, in bona voluntate tua Sion: ut ædificentur muri Jerusalem.
# Tunc acceptabis sacrifícium justitiæ, oblationes et holocausta: tunc imponent super altare tuum vitulos.

# Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness: according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions.
# Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
# For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before me.
# Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and be clear when thou judgest.
# Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
# Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
# Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
# Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
# Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
# Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
# Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
# Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
# Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
# Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
# O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
# For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou delightest not in burnt offering.
# The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
# Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls of Jerusalem.
# Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba.
# Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy steadfast love; according to thy abundant mercy blot out my transgressions.
# Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin!
# For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me.
# Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done that which is evil in thy sight, so that thou art justified in thy sentence and blameless in thy judgment.
# Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.
# Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward being; therefore teach me wisdom in my secret heart.
# Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.
# Fill me with joy and gladness; let the bones which thou hast broken rejoice.
# Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.
# Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right spirit within me.
# Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not thy holy Spirit from me.
# Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit.
# Then I will teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners will return to thee.
# Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation, and my tongue will sing aloud of thy deliverance.
# O Lord, open thou my lips, and my mouth shall show forth thy praise.
# For thou hast no delight in sacrifice; were I to give a burnt offering, thou wouldst not be pleased.
# The sacrifice acceptable to God is a broken spirit; a broken and contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
# Do good to Zion in thy good pleasure; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem,
# Then wilt thou delight in right sacrifices, in burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings; then bulls will be offered on thy altar.

# 求你按你的美意善待锡安，建造耶路撒冷的城墙。 
# 那时，你必喜爱公义的祭、燔祭、并全牲的燔祭；那时，人必将公牛献在你坛上。
