'''《诗篇》第23篇'''（{{lang-en|'''Psalm 23'''}}），因其首句“מִזְמ֥וֹר לְדָוִ֑ד  (舊約聖經希伯來文)大衛的詩歌, 耶和華 (יְהֹוָ֥ה) 是我的牧者 (רֹ֜עִ֗י)  (舊約聖經希伯來文)”而有时被称为'''{{lang|en|Shepherd Psalm}}'''（“牧者诗篇”），是《[[诗篇|诗篇]]》中较著名的一首。

这首诗歌的主题是说到[[上帝|上帝]]扮演保护者和供应者的角色，因而为[[犹太人|犹太人]]和[[基督徒|基督徒]]所喜爱。对于基督徒，“[[耶稣是主|主]]”指[[耶稣|耶稣]]；因为《[[约翰福音|约翰福音]]》记载，耶稣自称“[[好牧人|好牧人]]”。

《诗篇》第23篇已经多次被[[圣诗|圣诗]]作者谱上乐曲。

== 寫作背景 ==
正如詩篇23篇所言，這篇的作者是[[大卫王|大衛]]。由於大衛原是牧人，這篇亦以牧人和羊作比喻的詩篇對大衛的身世尤其貼切。除了以「牧者」、「青草」、「安歇的水邊」、「你的木杖和短棒」等充滿牧人特色的詞句外，這篇詩篇亦對應了大衛的人生經歷。

大衛一生都在逃避敵人殺害的日子中渡過。除了早年被掃羅追殺外，晚年更經歷兒子押沙龍的叛變，但大衛往往能逃命。因此，詩篇中有提到「我雖然行過死蔭的幽谷，也不怕遭害，因為你與我同在」，以及「在我敵人面前，你為我摆設筵席」。

== 译文 ==
=== 汉语 ===
{{HideH|[[国语和合本|国语和合本]]（1919年出版旧约）}}
<u>大衛</u>的诗。<br />
[[耶和华|耶和华]]是我的牧者；我必不至缺乏。<br />
祂使我躺卧在青草地上，<br />
领我在可安歇的水边。<br />
祂使我的灵魂甦醒，<br />
为自己的名引导我走义路。<br />
我虽然行过死荫的幽谷，<br />
也不怕遭害，因为你与我同在；你的杖，你的竿，都安慰我。<br />
在我敌人面前，你为我摆设筵席；<br />
你用油膏了我的头，使我的福杯满溢。<br />
我一生一世必有恩惠慈爱随着我，<br />
我且要住在耶和华的殿中，直到永远。

=== 犹太教 ===
在周六下午，[[犹太人|犹太人]]进食[[安息日|安息日]]第三餐时，经常用古代[[希伯来语|希伯来语]]吟唱这首诗歌。[[瑟法底犹太人|瑟法底犹太人]]和部分Hassidic犹太人在周五下午仪式上，以及安息日晚餐和日餐上都唱这首诗。犹太教葬礼（Yizkor）中也会唱这首诗歌。在犹太假日期间，墓地葬礼上用诵读这首诗来代替传统的祷告。

=== 基督教 ===
[[东正教|东正教]]徒在领受[[圣餐|圣餐]]前的祷告中通常都包括这首诗歌。<!-- It is also a popular passage to memorize, for those who choose to memorize selected portions of the Bible. --><!--
Psalm 23 was set in meter as part of the [[Metrical_psalter|Scottish Psalter]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20061116224839/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/anonymous/scotpsalter.p24.html] shortly after the [[Reformation|Reformation]]. It is in that form that it is most popularly encountered in [[Protestant|Protestant]] Churches and common culture to the present day. Traditionally, the metrical psalm is set to the tune 'Crimond' ([http://www.cyberhymnal.org/mid/c/r/i/crimond.mid MIDI file]), although other tunes such as [[Brother_James'_Air|Brother James' Air]] are also popular.  The words of Psalm 23, as arranged in the Scottish Psalter, are as follows: --><!--
{{Quotation|The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want:<br>
 He maketh me down to lie<br>
In pastures green; he leadeth me<br>
 The quiet waters by.<br>
<br>
My soul He doth restore again,<br>
 And me to walk doth make<br>
Within the paths of righteousness,<br>
 E'en for His own Name's sake.<br>
<br>
Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,<br>
 Yet will I fear none ill;<br>
For Thou art with me; and Thy rod<br>
 And staff me comfort still.<br>
<br>
My table Thou hast furnishèd<br>
 In presence of my foes;<br>
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,<br>
 And my cup overflows.<br>
<br>
Goodness and mercy all my life<br>
 Shall surely follow me;<br>
And in God's house for evermore<br>
 My dwelling-place shall be.|[[Scots_Metrical_Psalter|Scots Metrical Psalter]], 1650}} -->

由于诗中提到安慰与保护，以及曲调为人们所熟知，诗篇23篇成为葬礼仪式中的重要部分。<!--
Many composers have set the psalm to music, including [[Franz_Schubert|Schubert]]、[[Charles_Villiers_Stanford|Stanford]] and [[Herbert_Howells|Howells]]（included as part of his Requiem）. A recent contemporary setting was made by composer [[Howard_Goodall|Howard Goodall]] for the [[Great_Britain|British]] television series ''[[The_Vicar_of_Dibley|The Vicar of Dibley]]''. Goodall's melody is now regularly performed in many English churches
