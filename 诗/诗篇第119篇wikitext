'''《诗篇》第119篇'''（在[[通用希腊语|通用希腊语]]《[[七十士译本|七十士译本]]》中被列为'''第118篇'''）是《[[希伯来圣经|希伯来圣经]]·[[诗篇|诗篇]]》中最长的一篇，也是整本[[基督教|基督教]]《[[圣经|圣经]]》中最长的一[[圣经章节|章]]。在[[希伯来语|希伯来语]]原文中，开头一句是“Ashrei temimei derech（行为完全，遵行[[上主|上主]]律法的，这人便为有福。）”。这是喜爱并遵行神圣的[[律法|律法]]的人的祷告。这首诗的每一节都使用一个律法的同义词，诸如''dabar''、''mishpatim''等等。

这首诗共有176节，分为22段，每段包括8节，分别以22个[[希伯来字母|希伯来字母]]开始。在第一段，每一节都以第一个希伯来字母''aleph''开头；第二段，每一节都以第二个字母''bet''开头；依次类推。<!-- Poems that use patterns involving the initial letter of a line are called [[acrostics|acrostics]]; Psalm 119 is one of about a dozen alphabetic 离合诗 in the Bible. -->   

<!-- The acrostic form and the use of the Torah words constitute the framework for an elaborate prayer.  The grounds for the prayer are established in the first two stanzas (''alef'' and ''beth''): the Torah is held up as a source of blessing and right conduct, and the psalmist pledges to dedicate himself to the law.  The prayer proper begins in the third stanza (''gimel'', v. 17).  Like many other psalms, this prayer includes both dramatic lament (e.g. verses 81-88) joyous praise (e.g., verses 45-48) and prayers for life, deliverance and vindication (e.g., verses 132-134).  What makes Psalm 119 unique is the way that these requests are continually and explicitly grounded in the gift of the Torah and the psalmist's loyalty to it. -->

=== 东正教 ===
这首诗在[[通用希腊语|通用希腊语]]《[[七十士译本|七十士译本]]》中被列为第118篇，在[[东正教|东正教]]礼拜仪式中占有显著地位。<!--  There is a tradition that King David used this psalm to teach his young son Solomon the alphabet--but not just the alphabet for writing letters: the alphabet of the spiritual life. --> 

<!-- Psalm 118 comprises an entire [[Kathisma|Kathisma]] (division of the [[Psalter|Psalter]]) in Orthodox liturgical practice. This psalm is read daily at the Midnight Office in Orthodox monasteries. Verse 62 says “At midnight I arose to give thanks unto Thee for the judgments of Thy righteousness” (LXX). It is read at [[Matins|Matins]] on Saturdays and is also chanted on many Sundays throughout the year. A major portion of Matins on [[Holy_Saturday|Holy Saturday]] comprises chanting the entire psalm as a [[threnody|threnody]], divided into three parts (stases) with Praises (in Greek: ''Enkomia'') interspersed between each verse. This chanting is done as all stand holding candles around a catafalque over which has been placed a shroud embroidered with the figure of Christ laid out for burial. -->

<!-- Psalm 118 is also chanted with special solemnity at funeral services and on the various All-Souls Days which occur throughout the year, with "[[哈利路亚|哈利路亚]]" chanted between each verse. Its use here is a reflection of the chanting done on Holy Saturday.  "Alleluia" is used at Orthodox funerals to signify the victory over death accomplished by Christ's death and Resurrection, and the eternal reward promised to the faithful. -->
