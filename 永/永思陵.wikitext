Jurchen armies also began to run into the usual operational problems that diminished the power of steppe arimes on extended campaigns. Even in economically developed areas, an army that lived off the land could not return through the same place it had just looted. As Jurchen soldiers became more encumbered with loot, they became less mobile and less interested in further campaigning, though they might be more willing to reutrn in the future. Southern China was also much less favorable for cavalry than northern China, and the Jurchen had to cross not only numerous small rivers and canals but also the Huai and Yangzi rivers.|location=|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=t203wZyNqIwC&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=false|isbn=0415316901|page=55|pages=|title=War, politics and society in early modern China, 900-1795|author=Peter Allan Lorge|accessdate=2012-03-02|archive-date=2014-06-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140622185735/http://books.google.com/books?id=t203wZyNqIwC&pg=PA55#v=onepage&q&f=false|dead-url=no}}</ref>位于[[浙江省|浙江省]][[绍兴市|绍兴市]]东南17公里的皋埠镇牌口村攒宫茶场内，设有上宫、下宫和地宫。墓在[[元朝|元朝]]被[[杨琏真珈|杨琏真珈]]掘毁。
