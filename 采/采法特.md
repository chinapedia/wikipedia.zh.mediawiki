== 历史 ==

[[File:Safed1908.jpg|thumb]]
在《圣经》《士师记》1章17节中提到的迦南城市"Tzefat" or Safed 可能是指另一个不同的城市，位于现在以色列的南部而不是北部。

根据传说，采法特是大洪水之后，[[挪亚|挪亚]]的一个儿子所建。<!-- Historical sources indicate that the town was founded in the [[2nd_century|2nd century]] [[AD|AD]], during Roman times.  It was not mentioned for centuries after that, but in [[1289|1289]] it is known that a chief rabbi of Safed, one [[Moses_ben_Judah_ha-Cohen|Moses ben Judah ha-Cohen]], went to [[Tiberias|Tiberias]] to pay homage to [[Rambam|Rambam]].

In the early 16th century, the [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman Empire]] under [[Selim_I|Selim I]] conquered [[Palestine|Palestine]].  Under the Ottomans, Safed was part of the [[vilayet|vilayet]] of [[Sidon|Sidon]].

In [[1491|1491]], mention is made that the rabbi in the town had to supplement his income through a grocery market.  After the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in [[1492|1492]], many prominent rabbis found their way to Safed, which became the key center for Jewish mysticism, known as [[Kabbalah|Kabbalah]].  Among the prominent kabbalists who made their home in Safed were [[Isaac_Luria|Isaac Luria (Arizal)]]  and [[Moshe_Cordovero|Moshe Kordovero]]. Besides the kabbalists, Safed also attracted numerous other Jewish scholars and spirtualists, including [[Joseph_Caro|Joseph Caro]], the author of the [[Shulchan_Aruch|Shulchan Aruch]] and [[Shlomo_Halevi_Alkabetz|Shlomo Halevi Alkabetz]], composer of the [[Sabbath|Sabbath]] hymn [[Lecha_Dodi|Lecha Dodi]]. The influx of [[Sephardi_Jews|Sephardi Jews]] made Safed a global center for Jewish learning and a regional center for trade throughout 15th and 16th centuries.  A Hebrew printing press is established in Safed in 1577. It's the first press in Palestine and the first in whole Asia.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} The 8,000 or 10,000 Jews in Safed in 1555 grew to 20,000 or 30,000 by the end of the century. -->
<!-- A plague in [[1742|1742]] and an earthquake in [[1759|1759]] led to a decline of the Jewish community in Safed, leaving only seven families at its nadir.  An influx of Russian Jews in [[1776|1776]] and [[1781|1781]], and of the [[Perushim|Perushim]] in 1809 and 1810 reinvigorated the community. -->

[[File:Seraya_-_Ottoman_fortress_-_Safed.jpg|thumb]]
<!-- In [[1812|1812]], another plague killed an estimated 80% of 犹太人, and in [[1819|1819]] the remaining Jews were held for ransom by [[Abdallah_Pasha|Abdallah Pasha]], the governor of [[Akko|Akko]]. In [[1833|1833]] and [[1834|1834]], an [[Arab|Arab]] mob attacked the Jewish community, killing and pillaging many; Seven percent of the lost property was subsequently returned. On [[January_1|January 1]], [[1837|1837]], an earthquake killed 4,000 Jewish inhabitants, mostly by burying them in their homes. In [[1847|1847]], plague struck Safed again. During the whole 19th century, the Jewish community suffered from [[Bedouin|Bedouin]] and [[Arab|Arab]] attacks.<ref>http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/PLACES/safed.html</ref>

The Jewish population was increased in the last half of the 19th century by immigration from [[Persia|Persia]], [[Morocco|Morocco]], and [[Algeria|Algeria]]. [[Moses_Montefiore|Moses Montefiore]] visited Safed seven times and financed rebuilding of much of the town. Virtually all the antiquities of Safed were however destroyed by earthquakes.

Eighteen Jews were killed and 80 injured in the [[1929_Hebron_massacre|1929 Arab riots]].

Prior to 1948, about 10,000 of Safed's 12,000 residents were Arabs,<ref>[http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/PLACES/safed.html]</ref> most of whom fled as a result of the [[1948_Arab-Israeli_War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. Among the residents who [[Palestinian_exodus|became refugees]] are [[Palestinian_Authority|Palestinian Authority]] Prime Minister [[Mahmoud_Abbas|Mahmoud Abbas]] and his family.<ref name=Myre>Myre, Greg.

Today, Tzfat has seen a resurgence of popularity, and has again become a center for Jewish learning.  With quaint cobblestone streets, it has also gained a reputation as an [[art_colony|artist colony]]. -->
