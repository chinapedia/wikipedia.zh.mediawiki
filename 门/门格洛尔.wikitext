<!--==Origin of the name==
The city Mangalore was named after the local Hindu deity [[Mangaladevi|Mangaladevi]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/mangalore/mangaladevitemple.htm| title=   Mahatobhara Shree MangalaDevi Temple, Mangalore| accessdate= 2006-11-07| publisher = Our Karnataka.com}}</ref> According to legend [[Matsyendranath|Matsyendranath]], one of the important protagonist of the [[Nath|Nath]] cult had arrived at Mangalore with the princess of the South, Premaladevi, he converted the princess to his cult and she became his follower. He renamed her Mangaladevi. It is believed that they could not proceed further as Mangaladevi died after a brief period of illness and a temple was consecrated in her name at Bolar. Later the Mangaladevi temple was renovated by the Alupa king, Kundaverma Alupendra II in 968 AD.

===Other names===
The cosmopolitan nature of Mangalore is centuries old. This is reflected in the names used by the various linguistic groups in this region. In the native Tulu language, the city is known as ‘Kudla’ meaning ‘junction’ as the city is situated at the confluence of the two rivers – Netharavathi and Phalguni. [[Konkani|Konkani]]s use the variant ''Kodial''.   The [[Beary|Beary]]s, a  Muslim community who speak a dialect of their own, call it [[Maikala|Maikala]]. The southern Kerala people officially use the word ''Mangalapuram''.

On the occasion of ''"Suvarna Karnataka"'' in 2006, the [[Karnataka|Karnataka]] state government stated that the city would be renamed '''Mangalooru''' in English. [http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/oct82006/index2044162006107.asp]

==历史==
{{Unreferenced|date=February 2007}}
[[File:Town_Hall_014.jpg|thumb]], Mangalore]]
There are many historical references regarding to the town. Cosninos Indigo Plsustes referred to the port of Mangarouth <ref> http://www.laputanlogic.com/articles/2003/10/19-0002.html </ref>.  [[Pliny|Pliny]], a Roman historian made references of River Nithrias, and Greek historian [[Ptolemy|Ptolemy]] referred to Nitre.  Both the references probably referred to River Netravathi. Roman writer Arien called Mangalore Mandegora.  A copper inscription belonging to 7th century called Mangalore, Mangalapura. This region, given away as a reward to sage Parashurama by Samudraraja, is well known for its Kadali fruits.  It is the land of enchantment of Sahyadri mountains, where the great sages Kanva, Vysa, Vashista, Vishwamitra and other in the Loral past spent their days of meditation.

The ancient history proved Mangalore had been the capital of Alupa dynasty till 14th century.  A traveler, [[Ibn_Batuta|Ibn Batuta]] who had visited the town in 1342 stated that he arrived at a place named Manjurun or Mandjaur situated on a large estuary.  He had mentioned that the town was trading centre and [[Persian_people|Persian]] and [[Yemen|Yemen]] merchants were involved in trading activities.  In 1448, Abdul Razak, a Persian Ambassador passed via this route to [[Vijayanagar|Vijayanagar]]. He said that he had seen a glorious temple here. The inscriptions at [[Moodabidri|Moodabidri]] stated a king Mangaras Odeya was the governor of Mangaluru Raajya during the reign of Vira Harihararaya II of Vijayanagar dynasty. Another inscription stated that Deeva Raaja Odeya ruled the Mangalura Raajya in [[1429|1429]] during the reign of Vijayanagara King Veera Devaraya II.

Various powers have fought for control over Mangalore.  The major dynasties that ruled the town till the arrival of Portuguese were [[Kadambas|Kadambas]], the Western [[Chalukyas|Chalukyas]], [[Rastrakutas|Rastrakutas]], [[Alupas|Alupas]] and [[Hoysalas|Hoysalas]].  In [[1520|1520]] the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] took control of the area from Vijayanagara rulers, but in [[1695|1695]], the town was burned by the Arabs in retaliation for Portuguese restrictions on Arab trade. [[Mysorean|Mysore sultan]] ruler [[Hyder_Ali|Hyder Ali]] (1722–1782) conquered Mangalore in [[1763|1763]], and it was under his administration till [[1768|1768]], before being annexed by the [[Kingdom_of_Great_Britain|British]] between [[1768|1768]] and [[1794|1794]].  Later in 1794 [[Hyder_Ali|Hyder Ali]]'s son [[Tippu_Sultan|Tippu Sultan]] again took control of the area, but it was re-conquered by the British upon the fall of Srirangapatana in 1799.  A part of the [[Madras_Presidency|Madras Presidency]] up to [[Indian_independence|Indian independence]], Mangalore was merged into a unified Karnataka state in 1956.

<!--
==Transportation==
Mangalore's location makes it accessible by all forms of transport: road, rail, air and sea.  It is notable here that a native of Mangalore [[U._Srinivas_Mallya|U. Srinivas Mallya]] (a Member of the Indian Parliament) was instrumental in getting the National Highway system, the Mangalore Airport and the New Mangalore Port to Mangalore. In his tribute there is a statue of him along NH 17 near the [[Kadri_Park|Kadri Park]], and another at the entrance of the New Mangalore Harbour. 

===Roads===
[[File:Jyothi_Talkies_0111.jpg|250px]]
Three National Highways pass through Mangalore connecting the city to the rest of the country. NH-17, which runs from [[Panvel|Panvel]] (in [[Maharashtra|Maharashtra]]) to Cranganur Junction (near [[Edapally|Edapally]] in [[Kerala|Kerala]]), passes through Mangalore in a north-south direction, while NH-48 runs eastward to the state capital [[Bangalore|Bangalore]]. NH-13 runs north-east from Mangalore to [[Sholapur|Sholapur]], and a state highway connects it to the city of [[Mysore|Mysore]] passing through the hill town of [[Madikeri|Madikeri]]. There are about 300 buses from Bangalore to Mangalore on daily basis. 

Currently this cluster of highways is inadequate to handle the traffic that flows through the region, resulting in a [[NHAI|NHAI]] has decided to upgrade the national highways connecting New Mangalore Port to [[Surathkal|Surathkal]] on NH-17 and B.C. Road junction on NH-48.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/10/07/stories/2005100700631900.htm| date= [[2005-10-07|2005-10-07]]| title=   4-lane road project in Mangalore likely to be completed in 30 months| accessdate= 2006-10-13| publisher = Hindu Business Line}}</ref> Under the port connectivity programme of the National Highway Development Project (NHDP), a 37.5km stretch or these highways will be upgraded from two-lane to four-lane roads.

===Local public transport===
Mangalore's city bus service is operated by private operators, with routes covering the full extent of the city and beyond. There are two distinct sets of routes for the buses, with the city routes being covered by city buses, and the intercity routes being covered by service and express buses. Service buses essentially touch all towns and villages on the intercity route, while express buses reach their destination with very limited or no stops in between.

Another mode for local transportation is the [[autorickshaw|autorickshaw]]. This three wheeled vehicle operated within the city, often reaching places not covered by the routes of the city buses. While they are costlier than a bus ride, they are very convenient and a popular mode of transport.

===Railways===
The Mangalore Railway Station used to be the last station connecting Mangalore to the state of [[Kerala|Kerala]] in the south and to the rest of the country. While the British had left behind an extensive railway network when they left India, the stretch between Mangalore - [[Mumbai|Mumbai]], and Mangalore - [[Hassan|Hassan]] had never been connected.

A [[metre_gauge|metre gauge]] railway track was built through the [[Western_Ghats|Western Ghats]] in the east, connecting Mangalore with Hassan. While this provided a very picturesque journey, it was not very successful, and the tracks were removed several years later to be replaced with a [[broad_gauge|broad gauge]] line. However, due to lack of funds, and official apathy, and political backtracking and hard lobbying by the surface transport sector(REf: Times of India 6th April 2007){{Fact|date=March 2007}}, the conversion project was halted for several years. It has since resumed and some sections of this track are now functional. The broad gauge track connecting Mangalore to Bangalore via Hassan is open for freight traffic since May 2006.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2006/05/06/stories/2006050601880700.htm| date = [[2006-05-06|2006-05-06]]
|title = Mangalore-Hassan rail line open for freight traffic| accessdate = 2006-10-13| publisher = Hindu Business Line}}</ref> Movement of passenger traffic was supposed to start after December 2006. A certification on track safety is still awaited. As per news reports, passenger traffic will resume in May 2007

When India gained independence Mangalore was not connected to Mumbai by rail. The railway network established by the British terminated at Mangalore. Since independence there was a strong need to connect Mangalore to Mumbai and hence the [[Konkan_Railway|Konkan Railway]] came into being. The project was completed in 1998 and since then the travel time to the north of the country have come down considerably.

===Sea===
[[File:Panamburbeach057.jpg|250px]]
The Mangalore Harbour provides a connection by sea to the rest of the world. Currently dry, bulk and fluid cargos are handled by the [[New_Mangalore_Port|New Mangalore Port]], providing an important gateway to the state of Karnataka. It is also the station for the Coast Guard. The modern artificial harbour 10 km north of the town, is now India's ninth largest cargo handling port.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.newmangalore-port.com/| title =  http://www.newmangalore-port.com/| accessdate = 2006-10-13| publisher = New Mangalore Port}}</ref>

===Air===
[[Mangalore_International_Airport|Mangalore International Airport]] ([[IATA|IATA]]: IXE) is located near [[Bajpe|Bajpe]], around 20km north-east of the city centre.  Until 2005,  its small 1.6 km (5,200 ft) runway meant that it could only handle [[Boeing_737|Boeing 737]]-sized aircraft. However, on [[January_10|January 10]], [[2006|2006]] an [[Airbus_A320#A319|Airbus 319]] of [[Kingfisher_Airlines|Kingfisher Airlines]] was the first aircraft in that class to land on this runway.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.daijiworld.com/news/news_disp.asp?n_id=17758&n_tit=Mangalore%3A%20Kingfisher%20Creates%20History%20%2D%20Airbus%20A%2D319%20Trial%20Flight%20Lands%20at%20Bajpe| date = [[2006-01-13|2006-01-13]]| title =  Kingfisher Creates History - Airbus A-319 Trial Flight Lands at Bajpe| accessdate = 2006-11-03| publisher = DaijiWorld}}</ref> A new international length (2.9 km) runway was constructed and commissioned on [[10_May|10 May]] 2006.

With larger aircraft now able to fly to Mangalore, a proposal to build a new terminal building, which will reduce the distance between Mangalore city and the airport by about 7km, is under consideration. Construction of the terminal building would start likely in January 2007 and take about 19 months time according to the Airports Authority of India.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.bellevision.com/newshead.asp?nhid=3702| title =  Mangalore: Work on Airport terminal building to begin soon| accessdate = 2006-10-27| publisher = Bellevision Global}}</ref>

At present, daily flights are available to [[Mumbai|Mumbai]], [[Bangalore|Bangalore]] and [[Chennai|Chennai]], and international flights are available to the Gulf countries.  On [[3_October|3 October]] 2006, an [[Air-India_Express|Air-India Express]] Boeing 737-800 (flight IX-802) from [[Dubai_International_Airport|Dubai]] became the first international flight to land at Mangalore, touching down at 6:11 (IST).<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.bellevision.com/indexdetail.asp?lupd=435| date = [[2006-10-03|2006-10-03]]| title = First International Flight Lands At Bajpe| accessdate = 2006-10-04| publisher = Bellevision Global| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061029174346/http://www.bellevision.com/indexdetail.asp?lupd=435| archive-date = 2006-10-29| dead-url = yes}}</ref> Now there are flights from Mangalore to Abu Dhabi, Muscat, Bahrain and Doha. The frequency of flights to Mangalore from Dubai has been increased to five times a week. The number of passengers using Mangalore Airport has gone up by 100% last year.(From 2.6 lakhs to almost 5 lakhs)

==Industry==
Mangalore's economy is dominated by agricultural processing and port-related activities. Imports include tropical [[timber|timber]] from south-east Asia for furniture making, a necessity since India places major restrictions on its own teak felling. The port handles 75% of India’s [[coffee|coffee]] exports and the bulk of its cashew nuts. The latter are brought from many coastal areas (notably from [[Kerala|Kerala]]); the National Cashew research centre is nearby at [[Puttur,_Karnataka|Puttur]]. Mangalore roof tiles are famous all over India. The roof tiles made from red clay and baked, is used as roof in many parts of the country. There is rapid decline in this industry due to use of RCC roofs.

Mangalore is home to the automobile [[leaf_spring|leaf spring]] industry. In 1950 the Canara Workshops Ltd started production under the brand name Canara Springs, and in 1976 Lamina Suspension Products Ltd stared production under the brand name Lamina. Thereafter various small scale manufacturers have put up shop in the industrial area at Baikampady to manufacture leaf springs. Over the period there has been a lot of consolidation because of some of the smaller units shutting down. Currently there are about six or seven units producing about one thousand metric tonnes of leaf springs per month. They cater almost entirely to the replacement or after market of South India.  Beedi rolling industry is also famous in Mangalore.

The major industries  in Mangalore are Mangalore Chemical and Fertilizers Ltd., Kuduremukh Iron Ore Company Ltd., Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd, BASF, ELF GAS.

===Modern industry===
Major [[information_technology|information technology]] and [[outsourcing|outsourcing]] companies have started locating their facilities in Mangalore. IT major [[Infosys|Infosys]] was one of the first to move in and establish a large presence. Wipro also plans to set-up its development facility soon in Mangalore. Outsourcing major MPhasis BPO was one of the first outsourcing companies to set up their facilities near the city. First Indian corporation,a division of First American corporation  has set up shop in the Manasa Towers on MG Road. 

Three dedicated IT parks are currently under construction. Two such parks are under construction, one Export Promotion Industrial Park (EPIP) at Ganjimatt and a second IT SEZ near Mangalore University. A third IT SEZ is being proposed at Ganjimat. Another IT SEZ of 2 million square feet is under construction at Thumbay by the BA group. This will include a business centre, convention centre, Mall and helipad facility.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/08/31/stories/2006083118290300.htm| date = 2006-08-31| title = Two more plans for EPIP cleared| accessdate = 2006-09-29| publisher= [[The_Hindu|The Hindu]]}}</ref>

The Oil and Natural Gas Corporation [[ONGC|ONGC]] plans to invest over Rs. 35,000 crore in a new 15 million tonnes refinery, petrochemical plant and power and LNG plants at the Mangalore Special Economic Zone. This will be the first Petroleum, Chemicals, Petrochemicals Investment Region (PCPIR) of the country.<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.hindu.com/2006/09/20/stories/2006092006341700.htm| date = 2006-09-19| title =  ONGC's huge outlay for Mangalore SEZ| accessdate = 2006-09-29| publisher= [[The_Hindu|The Hindu]]}}</ref>

The recent investors meet in Mangalore received proposals worth more than 3,000 crores in the IT and Hospitality sectors. 67,000 new jobs would be created in Mangalore by TCS, Wipro, KEL and a few other companies.{{Fact|date=February 2007}} This does not however include the massive expansion by Infosys.

Thus, with rapid strides in the nearby future Mangalore is well on its course to be one of the most promising future Metropolis of India. Is expected to house a number of well known IT Companies in the nearby future, thereby providing a serious alternative to Bangalore for the aspiring IT professionals.
According to International edition of 'India Today' (November 28-December 4'th,2006),Mangalore is the fastest growing non metro in the south followed by Kochi.

===Banking and finance===
Three of the nineteen nationalised banks were established in Mangalore during the first half of the 20th century. The three banks are:-
* [[Corporation_Bank|Corporation Bank]] (founded in 1906 by Late Khan Bahadur Haji Abdulla Haji Kasim Saheb Bahadur)
* [[Canara_Bank|Canara Bank]] (founded in 1906 by Late Shri [[Ammembal_Subba_Rao_Pai|Ammembal Subba Rao Pai]])
* [[Vijaya_Bank|Vijaya Bank]] (founded in 1931 by Late Shri A B Shetty)
In addition to these three there was one more which was established in nearby Manipal, and one more which was not nationalised. These two banks are:-
* [[Syndicate_Bank|Syndicate Bank]], (co-founded in 1924 by Dr. [[T_M_A_Pai|T M A Pai]] and Sri [[Upendra_Ananth_Pai|Upendra Ananth Pai]] in Manipal, along with a Mangalorean Sri [[V_S_Kudva|V S Kudva]]. 
* [[Karnataka_Bank|Karnataka Bank]], (founded in 1924 one of the larger private sector banks which escaped nationalisation)

These banks are considered quality institutions across the country - the national character taken on with nationalisation has been combined with the culture and quality of service inculcated by the founders. Prior to nationalisation, these banks were stewarded by very efficient and competent teams of managers, predominantly Mangaloreans. During this tremendous growth phase, these banks spawned a whole generation of bankers from Mangalore across these firms from the top to bottom. A large proportion of the Konkani, Bunt and brahmin community from Mangalore were at one point employed by these banks. 

While Karnataka Bank and Corporation Bank are still head quartered in Mangalore, Vijaya Bank and Canara Bank are head quartered in Bangalore and Syndicate Bank is head quartered in Manipal. Even to date, a large proportion of employees at all levels in these banks are of Mangalorean origin.

===Traditional areas===
[[File:Mangalore_fishing.JPG|250px]]
Mangalore developed as a fishing town and this has been maintained to this day, with the local diet maintaining a high proportion of fish. The fishing industry employs thousands of people, and their produce is exported from around the region.

The nationalisation of the banking sector was a big blow to the Mangalorean economy, but it has not affected the entrepreneurial spirit of the population.
