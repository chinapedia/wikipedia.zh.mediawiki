<!--==劇情==
Root Beer Guy (voiced by Jack Pendarvis) is a candy citizen with a dead-end job; as a method of [[escapism|escapism]], he often tries his hand at writing a crime and detective novel. One night, while working at his typewriter, he oversees Finn and Jake kidnapping Princess Bubblegum. He tells his wife, Cherry Cream Soda (voiced by [[Anne_Heche|Anne Heche]]), who brushes Root Beer Guy's story off as a dream. Root Beer Guy decides to take matters into his own hands, and he begins investigating. After being told forcefully by Finn and Jake to drop the case, Root Beer Guy soon discovers that they recently purchased suspicious materials and are headed out to Lake Butterscotch, possibly to dispose of a body.

Root Beer Guy follows them, only to witness them throwing what appears to be Princess Bubblegum into the lake. In a desperate attempt to alert the authorities, he calls the banana guards and tells them that he himself kidnapped the princess. They arrive to arrest him, but soon Bubblegum emerges from the lake and admits that the entire scheme was a set up to test the banana guard's sleuthing skills. Soon, the princess learns that Root Beer Guy was the one who actually solved the case, and she promotes him to head of the security force.

"Root Beer Guy" was written and storyboarded by guest artist [[Graham_Falk|Graham Falk]], from a story by [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], Jack Pendarvis, and Adam Muto.<ref name=episodecredits/> The basis for the episode was largely developed by Muto, who wrote the outline concerning a "Candy Kingdom everyman" whose life is changed after witnessing a crime.

Pendarvis voiced the titular character after Osborne and Muto suggested that he do it. Reportedly, the staff thought about asking horror writer [[Stephen_King|Stephen King]], but he was never approached.<ref name=rbg1/> Pendarvis agreed to play the part and—because he lives in Mississippi—he flew down in May 2013 to record his lines.<ref name=rbg1/><ref>{{cite web|last=Pendarvis|first=Jack|title=In the Land of Richard Dix|url=http://jackpendarvis.blogspot.com/2013/05/in-land-of-richard-dix.html|publisher=[[Blogspot|Blogspot]]|accessdate=February 3, 2014|date=May 2, 2013}}</ref> [[Anne_Heche|Anne Heche]] was chosen to voice Cherry Cream soda after Pendarvis noted that her character was similar to Maggie Pistone, a character played by Heche in the 1997 crime film ''[[Donnie_Brasco_(film)|Donnie Brasco]]''. Osborne, a noted fan of Heche, seconded the idea and Heche was approached about the part.<ref name=rbg1/> The episode also featured a vocal cameo by Christopher, a 14-year-old who was able to appear on the show thanks to the [[Make-a-Wish_Foundation|Make-a-Wish Foundation]]; he voiced Gum Drop Guy.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cartoon Network|title=14yr-old Make A Wish child wished 2 do a voice over 4 #AdventureTime|url=https://twitter.com/cartoonnetwork/status/407612736395550720|publisher=[[Twitter|Twitter]]|accessdate=December 3, 2013|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Cartoon Network|title=14-year-old Christopher wished through Make-A-Wish America and Make-A-Wish Massachusetts and Rhode Island to do a voice over on his favorite show, Adventure Time|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152118349943383&set=a.10152118349838383.1073741854.321031023382&type=1|publisher=[[Facebook|Facebook]]|accessdate=December 3, 2013|date=December 2, 2013}}</ref>
