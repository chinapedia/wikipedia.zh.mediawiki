《'''帶我去看棒球賽'''》（''Take Me Out to the Ball Game''）是20世紀初[[美國|美國]][[紐約|紐約]][[叮砰巷|叮砰巷]]創作出的歌曲，儘管作曲作詞者從未在現場看過球賽，但这首歌卻受到相當大地迴響成了非官方的棒球國歌。傳統上，球場會在第七局的伸展活動中播放這首歌，而球迷也會跟著旋律合唱。

==歌曲歷史==
這首歌的歌詞是由[[Jack_Norworth|Jack Norworth]]撰寫，除此以外他還寫了另一首知名作品〈''Shine On, Harvest Moon''〉。某日Jack Norworth搭乘地鐵看到窗外公車廣告板上寫著「今日球賽-[[舊金山巨人|馬球球場]]」的廣告詞，突然啟發了他的靈感寫下了這首歌的歌詞，然後交由[[Albert_Von_Tilzer|Albert Von Tilzer]]負責譜曲，儘管兩人過去從未在現場看過球賽。

==英文歌詞==
以下為1908年和1927年，兩個不同版本的比較：

Katie Casey was baseball mad,<br>
Had the fever and had it bad.<br>
Just to root for the home town crew,<br>
Ev'ry sou<br>
Katie blew.<br>
On a Saturday her young beau<br>
Called to see if she'd like to go<br>
To see a show<br>
But Miss Kate said "No,<br>
I'll tell you what you can do:"<br>

Nelly Kelly loved baseball games,<br>
Knew the players, knew all their names.<br>
You could see her there ev'ry day,<br>
Shout "Hurray" <br>
When they'd play.<br>
Her boyfriend by the name of Joe<br>
Said, "To Coney Isle, dear, let's go",<br>
Then Nelly started to fret and pout,<br>
And to him, I heard her shout:<br>

Take me out to the ball game, <br>
Take me out with the crowd; <br>
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jacks, <br>
I don't care if I never get back. <br>
Let me root, root, root for the home team, <br>
If they don't win, it's a shame. <br>
For it's one, two, three strikes, you're out, <br>
At the old ball game. <br>

Katie Casey saw all the games,<br>
Knew the players by their first names.<br>
Told the umpire he was wrong,<br>
All along,<br>
Good and strong.<br>
When the score was just two to two,<br>
Katie Casey knew what to do,<br>
Just to cheer up the boys she knew,<br>
She made the gang sing this song:<br>

Nelly Kelly was sure some fan,<br>
She would root just like any man,<br>

Just to cheer up the boys she knew,<br>
