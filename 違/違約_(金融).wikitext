Default can be of two types: debt services default and technical default.  Debt service default occurs when the borrower has not made a scheduled payment of interest or principal.  Technical default happens when an affirmative or a negative covenant is violated. 

Affirmative covenants are clauses in debt contracts that require firms to maintain certain levels of capital or [[accounting_ratio|financial ratio]]s.  The most commonly violated restrictions in affirmative covenants are tangible net worth, [[working_capital|working capital]]/short term [[liquidity|liquidity]], and debt service coverage.

Negative covenants are clauses in debt contracts that limit or prohibit corporate actions (e.g. sale of assets, payment of dividends) that could impair the position of creditors. Negative covenants may be continuous or incurrence-based. Violations of negative covenants are rare compared to violations of affirmative covenants.

With most debt (including corporate debt, mortgages and bank loans) a covenant is included in the debt contract which states that the total amount owed becomes immediately payable on the first instance of a default of payment. Generally, if the debtor defaults on any debt to the lender, a cross default covenant in the debt contract states that that particular debt is also in default.

In [[corporate_finance|corporate finance]], upon an uncured default,  the holders of the debt will usually initiate proceedings (file a petition of involuntary bankruptcy) to foreclose on any collateral securing the debt. Even if the debt is not secured by collateral, debt holders may still sue for bankruptcy, to ensure that the corporation's assets are used to repay the debt.

There are several financial models for analyzing default risk, such as the [[Jarrow-Turnbull_model|Jarrow-Turnbull model]], [[Edward_Altman|Edward Altman]]'s [[Z-score|Z-score]] model, or the structural model of default by [[Robert_C._Merton|Robert C. Merton]] ([[Merton_Model|Merton Model]]).

Sovereign borrowers such as [[nation-state|nation-state]]s generally are not subject to bankruptcy courts in their own jurisdiction, and thus may be able to default without legal consequences. One example is with [[North_Korea|North Korea]], which in 1987 defaulted on some of its loans. In such cases, the defaulting country and the creditor are more likely to renegotiate the interest rate, length of the loan, or the [[principal_sum|principal]] payments<ref>{{cite book |author=Rahnama-Moghadam, Samavati, Dilts |title=Doing Business in Less Developed Countries: Financial Opportunities and Risks |year=1995 |publisher=Quorum/Greenwood |pages=108 |isbn=0899308546|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=C4Z6kHpadd4C&pg=PA108&lpg=PA108&dq=%22north+korea+defaulted%22&source=web&ots=wSBHZCbtMY&sig=P7n3fDbn1SiZMYFE4XHUs03dSlY}}</ref>.

When a debtor ''chooses'' to default on a loan, despite being able to service it (make payments), this is said to be a [[strategic_default|strategic default]]. This is most commonly done for [[non-recourse_loan|non-recourse loan]]s, where the creditor cannot make other claims on the debtor; a common example is a situation of [[negative_equity|negative equity]] on a [[mortgage_loan|mortgage loan]] in [[common_law|common law]] jurisdictions such as the [[United_States|United States]], which is in general non-recourse. In this latter case, default is colloquially called '''jingle mail''' – the debtor stops making payments and mails the keys to the creditor, generally a bank.
