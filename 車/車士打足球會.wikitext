'''車士打足球會'''（{{lang-en|'''Chester Football Club'''}}）是位於[[英格蘭|英格蘭]][[英格兰西北|西北部]]與[[威爾斯|威爾斯]]邊境接壤[[柴郡|柴郡]]首府[[切斯特|切斯特]]的[[足球俱乐部|足球俱乐部]]，由球迷自主擁有，於前身球隊[[切斯特城足球俱乐部|切斯特城足球俱乐部]]在2010年被[[清盤|清盤]]後成立<ref name=gdn>{{cite news|language=en|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2010/may/06/john-amaechi-sports-administrators|title=Chester FC on the rise|publisher=''guardian.co.uk''|accessdate=19 June 2010|date=6 May 2010|first=Owen|last=Gibson|location=London}}</ref>，現時在[[英格蘭足球聯賽系統|英格蘭足球聯賽系統]]第五級的[[英格蘭足球議會全國聯賽|英格蘭足球議會全國聯賽]]參賽。球會以{{tsl|en|Deva Stadium||德瓦运动场}}（Deva Stadium）作為主場球場。

車士打當初被罰到第九級的[[英格蘭西北郡足球聯賽|英格蘭西北郡足球聯賽]]（Northwest Counties League）作賽，經成功向[[英格蘭足球總會|英格蘭足球總會]]提出上訴，於2010/11年球季在[[英格蘭北部超級聯賽|北部超級聯賽甲組北]]（Northern Premier League Division One North）從新起步。

球會成立的首三個球季連續取得參賽組別的冠軍錦標：2011/11年的北部超級聯賽甲組北、2011/12年的北部超級聯賽超聯組和2012/13年的[[英格蘭足球議會北部聯賽|足球議會北部聯賽]]。雖然車士打在2013/14年球季在[[英格蘭足球議會全國聯賽|足球議會全國聯賽]]的首個球季落入降班區域，由於[[靴尔福特联足球俱乐部|-{zh-hans:靴尔福特; zh-hk:赫里福特聯;}-]]因財務問題被逐出[[英格蘭足球議會聯賽|足球議會聯賽]]而獲得挽留。

==歷史==
===背景===
車士打的[[切斯特城足球俱乐部|前身]]早於1885年成立，並於1931/32年球季加入[[英格蘭足球聯賽|英格蘭足球聯賽]]的北區丙組聯賽。球會於1983年由車士打更名為車士打城。在英格蘭足球聯賽時期主要在第四級作賽，間中升班到第三級聯賽，直到2000年首次降班到[[英格蘭足球議會聯賽|足球議會聯賽]]。2004年贏得冠軍重返英格蘭足球聯賽<ref>{{cite web |language=en |url=http://www.chester-city.co.uk/archive.asp |title=Chester City: A Brief History |publisher=''chester-city.co.uk'' |deadurl=yes |accessdate=22 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100327161505/http://www.chester-city.co.uk/archive.asp |archive-date=2010-03-27 }}</ref>。車士打城於2009年再次降班到足球議會聯賽，而球會亦陷入財務危機。隨著車士打城降班，球會即時申請進入財務接管<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chester/8054327.stm |title=Chester move into administration |work=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2009-05-17 |accessdate=2014-09-11 }}</ref>，並於新球季開季前被扣減25分<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chester/8184045.stm |title=Chester hit by 25-point penalty |work=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2009-08-06 |accessdate=2014-09-11 }}</ref>，其間前主席斯蒂芬·沃恩（Stephen Vaughan）的家族全資收購球會<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chester/8095360.stm |title=Vaughan family buy Chester City |work=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2009-06-11 |accessdate=2014-09-11 }}</ref>。車士打城於2010年1月26日以1[[英鎊|英鎊]]的代價求售<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chester/8479433.stm |title=Chester City up for sale for £1 |work=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2010-01-26 |accessdate=2014-09-11 }}</ref>，惟無人問津，球隊於2月26日先被逐出[[英格蘭足球議會聯賽|足球議會聯賽]]<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chester/8538236.stm |title=Chester City expelled from Football Conference |work=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2010-02-26 |accessdate=2014-09-11 |archive-date=2010-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304233243/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chester/8538236.stm |dead-url=no }}</ref>，並取消該季的所有比賽記錄<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_conf/8499219.stm |title=Chester City results erased from Blue Square Premier |work=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2010-03-08 |accessdate=2014-09-11 |archive-date=2010-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313133459/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_conf/8499219.stm |dead-url=no }}</ref>，再於3月10日被[[英格蘭及威爾斯高等法院|高等法院]]頒令[[清盤|清盤]]<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/c/chester/8559704.stm |title=Chester City wound up in High Court |work=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2010-03-10 |accessdate=2014-09-11 |archive-date=2017-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730125126/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/chester/8559704.stm |dead-url=no }}</ref>。

「車士打城球迷聯盟」（City Fans United，簡稱CFU）於2009年10月在車士打城風雨飄搖中成立，當時球會深陷財務危機之中<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://www.twohundredpercent.net/?p=2457 |title=An Open Letter To The Owners Of Chester City FC |work=''twohundredpercent.net'' |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2010-05-13 }}</ref>。僅於「球迷聯盟」正式成立一個月後，球迷於對伊斯特本（Eastbourne Borough）的主場賽事中衝進球場草坪抗議當時球會的管理層，球證鳴笛腰斬比賽<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/8376691.stm |title=Chester-Eastbourne game abandoned] |work=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=30 April 2011 }}</ref>。其後「球迷聯盟」舉行會員投票，於2010年1月呼籲球迷[[杯葛|杯葛]]車士打城<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://www.cityfansunited.com/the-news/72-official-boycott-decision-reached-by-cfu-members.html |title=City Fans United: Official Boycott Decision reached by CFU Members |work=''cityfansunited.com'' |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2012 }}</ref>，事件的導火線是球會辭退一直辛苦維持的領隊吉姆·哈维（Jim Harvey），致使「球迷聯盟」表達其對事件感到『失望、震驚和憤怒』<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://www.cityfansunited.com/the-news/69-cfu-respond-to-departure-of-jim-harvey.html |title=City Fans United: CFU respond to departure of Jim Harvey |work=''cityfansunited.com'' |date=21 January 2010 |accessdate=30 April 2012 }}</ref>。「球迷聯盟」早於2月在車士打城解散前數星期已開始籌組一支「鳳凰重生」球隊於來季參賽<ref>{{citenews |language=en |url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-city-fc/chester-city-fc-news/2010/02/25/chester-city-fc-blues-legends-throw-their-support-behind-cfu-s-phoenix-club-plan-59067-25908080/ |title=Chester City FC: Blues legends throw their support behind CFU's phoenix club plan work=''chesterchronicle.co.uk'' |date=25 February 2010 |accessdate=13 May 2010 }}</ref>。

===建立===
Chester FC started competing in the [[2010–11_in_English_football#New_clubs|2010–11 season]]. The FA initially recommended that they should be placed in the [[North_West_Counties_Football_League|North West Counties Football League]] Premier Division,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/article.asp?aid=10575&iid=189&sud=1691|title=FA Recommend Chester To NW Counties|publisher=The Non-League Paper|accessdate=19 June 2010|date=18 May 2010|first=Andy|last=White}}</ref> a decision that the club appealed against.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityfansunited.com/the-news/124-chester-fc-lodge-formal-appeal-with-fa-over-placing.html|title=Chester FC lodge formal appeal with FA over placing |publisher=City Fans United|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> On 18 June 2010, the FA made a statement<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/Leagues/NewsAndFeatures/2010/chester-180610|title=Chester Decision Upheld}}</ref> saying that Chester would instead be placed a step higher and would play in the [[Northern_Premier_League_Division_One_North|Northern Premier League Division One North]], the 8th tier of the [[English_football_league_system|English football league system]]. The club was formally relaunched on 20 May 2010, when [[Neil_Young_(football_manager_born_1975)|Neil Young]] and [[Gary_Jones_(footballer_born_1975)|Gary Jones]] were announced as the first manager and assistant of the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenonleaguefootballpaper.com/article.asp?aid=10609&iid=190&sud=1693|title=Young appointed Chester Manager|publisher=The Non-League Paper|accessdate=19 June 2010|date=24 May 2010|first=Andy|last=White}}</ref> A pre-season friendly played at [[Colwyn_Bay_F.C.|Colwyn Bay]] on 10 July 2010 was the first fixture for the new club, the match resulting in a 2–0 victory for Colwyn Bay.

===Inaugural 2010–11 season===
The club's first league match was on 24 August 2010, away at [[Warrington_Town_F.C.|Warrington Town]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityfansunited.com/component/content/article/125-manager-appointed-at-chester-fc.html|title=Manager appointed at Chester FC |publisher=City Fans United|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=22 May 2010}}</ref> Rob Hopley scored the first ever goal for the club in the 6th minute, but the game ended in a 1–1 draw.<ref name="Warrington Town 1 Chester FC 1">{{cite web | url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-fc/chester--fc-match-reports/2010/08/24/warrington-town-1-chester-fc-1-59067-27130245/ | title=Warrington Town 1 Chester FC 1 | work=Chester Chronicle | date=24 August 2010| accessdate=21 May 2011 |last=Triggs|first=David}}{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> Chester played their first home game against [[Trafford_F.C.|Trafford]] and won 6–0, Michael Wilde scoring a hat-trick.<ref name="CHESTER 6 TRAFFORD 0">{{cite web | url=http://www.leaderlive.co.uk/news/92959/chester-6-trafford-0.aspx | title=CHESTER 6 TRAFFORD 0 | work=The Leader | accessdate=21 May 2011 |last=Wall|first=Dennis}}</ref> In September, Chester lost their first game after a 2–1 home defeat to [[Chorley_F.C|Chorley]].<ref name="Penalty sinks Chester as Chorley extend lead">{{cite web | url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/chesterfootballclub/s/results-reports-23021.html&official=1&fixture_id=168207 | title=Penalty sinks Chester as Chorley extend lead | work=pitcherio.com | accessdate=21 May 2011 |last=Banks|first=Jeff}}</ref>

Second-placed Skelmersdale then dropped points, to leave Chester three points clear with one remaining game, and a goal difference eight ahead of their chasing rivals.<ref name="Second half show puts the Blues on the verge of title win">{{cite web | url=http://www.pitchero.com/clubs/chesterfootballclub/s/results-reports-23021.html&official=1&fixture_id=168635 | title=Second half show puts the Blues on the verge of title win | work=pichero.com | accessdate=21 May 2011}}</ref> In a wild finale to the season, Chester were promoted by only a single point of goal difference, as the Blues went down to a shock 2–1 defeat at [[Garforth_Town_F.C.|Garforth Town]], while Skelmersdale thrashed [[Ossett_Albion_A.F.C.|Ossett Albion]] 7–2, with two goals from Ossett striker Danny Toronczak the difference between promotion and the playoffs for Chester.<ref name="Garforth Town 2 Chester 1 - Blues clinch title after last-day drama ">{{cite web | url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-news/featured-stories/2011/04/29/garforth-town-2-chester-1-blues-clinch-title-after-last-day-drama-59067-28609323/ | title=Garforth Town 2 Chester 1 – Blues clinch title after last-day drama | work=Chester Chronicle | date=29 April 2011 | accessdate=21 May 2011 | last=Dowling|first=Mark}}</ref>

Unusually for a club at the eighth level of English football, Chester played in neither the [[FA_Trophy|FA Trophy]] nor the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] in their inaugural season, as FA rules required a minimum of one season of prior football before playing in the Trophy, and two years before playing in the Cup.

===2011–12 season===
Following Chester's promotion to the [[Northern_Premier_League_Premier_Division|NPL Premier Division]], form was initially variable, with two losses in their first six league fixtures. However, form, particularly defensively, improved greatly, with no goals conceded in September, and the 1–0 win against [[Chasetown_F.C.|Chasetown]] was their seventh successive clean sheet in the league. This run ended after a 1–1 draw away at [[Buxton_F.C.|Buxton]] in the next match, but only after they established a new Chester City/Chester FC record of 781 minutes without conceding across eight games in all competitions.

Chester's form was strong through November and December, with a run of five consecutive victories, resulting in Chester going top of the table after the 1–0 win against [[Ashton_United_F.C.|Ashton United]], a position the club held at the end of the year, finishing 2011 with a stormy 1–1 draw at second placed [[Northwich_Victoria_F.C.|Northwich Victoria]], a game which saw three dismissals.<ref name="Northwich Victoria 1 Chester 1 - Northwich Victoria 1 Chester FC 1: Neil Young lets rip after red card drama in top-of-table clash ">{{cite web |url=http://www.chesterchronicle.co.uk/chester-fc/chester--fc-match-reports/2011/12/26/northwich-victoria-1-chester-fc-1-neil-young-lets-rip-after-red-card-drama-in-top-of-table-clash-59067-30015782/ |title=Northwich Victoria 1 Chester FC 1: Neil Young lets rip after red card drama in top-of-table clash |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> They were not to be caught again in the league during the season. During the calendar year 2011, Chester were unbeaten in home league fixtures. Chester's last loss of the season came in their 2–1 home defeat to Hednesford on 21 January. After that point, the team went on a 16-match unbeaten run, including a period of eight consecutive victories encompassing the entirety of March.

On 9 April 2012, Chester gained their second successive promotion, after a late goal from Matty McGinn in the game against second-placed Northwich gave the club a 1–1 draw and the point they needed to see off the challenge with three games remaining. The game was watched by a crowd of 5,009, which was not only a record for the reformed club, but also the highest gate ever recorded in the seventh tier of English football. At the conclusion of the season, Chester finished with 100 points, 17 clear of second-placed [[Northwich_Victoria_F.C.|Northwich]], having scored 102 goals along the way, and conceded only 29.

In the [[FA_Trophy|FA Trophy]], Chester went on an extended run, winning through three qualifying rounds to reach the first round proper, where they recorded a 5–1 away victory against [[North_Ferriby_United_A.F.C.|North Ferriby United]]. They bowed out of the competition in the second round in an away tie against [[Conference_Premier|Conference Premier]] side [[Ebbsfleet_United_F.C.|Ebbsfleet United]], losing 3–2. As this was only the club's second season, they remained ineligible for the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]].

===2012–13 season===
Chester began the 2012–13 season as second favourites with bookmakers for the [[Conference_North|Conference North]] title. Their start to the season justified those predictions, as they won their first seven matches, a club record for Chester FC and also surpassing Chester City's best start to the season. Included in that run were victories over pre-season favourites [[F.C._Halifax_Town|F.C. Halifax Town]] and a 4–0 drubbing of previously unbeaten [[Guiseley_A.F.C.|Guiseley]]. Despite this, the club only sat in second place in the division, as [[Brackley_Town_F.C.|Brackley Town]] also won each of their first seven games. The run came to an end with a 3–2 defeat at [[Boston_United_F.C.|Boston United]] in Chester's eighth match. After two more victories, against [[Stalybridge_Celtic_FC|Stalybridge Celtic]] and [[Bishop's_Stortford_FC|Bishop's Stortford]], Chester went to the top of the table for the first time due to a 1–1 draw with [[Bradford_Park_Avenue|Bradford Park Avenue]]. Following this draw, Chester then went on a run of twelve consecutive league victories, including a 3–2 win at Brackley. This run came to an end with a goalless draw, again against Bradford PA on 5 January, which was also the first league match of the season in which Chester failed to score. Chester were promoted to the Conference Premier following their 1–0 win at home to Boston United.

In the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]], Chester FC's first ever match was a 1–1 draw away at [[Gainsborough_Trinity_FC|Gainsborough Trinity]] in the second qualifying round. Chester won the replay at the [[Exacta_Stadium|Exacta Stadium]] 2–1 with goals from Dominic Collins and [[Levi_Mackin|Levi Mackin]]. Chester's third qualifying round tie, at home to [[FC_Halifax_Town|FC Halifax Town]], was marred by crowd trouble, and finished in a 1–1 draw. Chester exited the FA Cup following a 3–1 win by Halifax at [[The_Shay|The Shay]] in the replay. The [[FA_Trophy|FA Trophy]] proved less successful for Chester than in the previous season, as the Blues failed to win a single match, exiting in a replay at [[Worksop_Town_F.C.|Worksop Town]].

On 6 April 2013, Chester were confirmed as champions of the Conference North, beating Boston United 1–0 at the Exacta through a Lewis Turner header, winning a third successive title, and in doing so, becoming the first club in English football history to achieve three successive promotions. Three promotions in their first three years means that Chester will play their next season's football in the [[Conference_Premier|Conference Premier]], the level from which their predecessors [[Chester_City_F.C.|Chester City]] were expelled in 2010.

Chester set several league records for the Conference North in this prolific season: most wins (34), fewest defeats (3), most points (107), most goals scored (103), best goal difference (+71) and also the longest unbeaten streak (30 games).

===2013–14 season===
As expected, for the 2013–14 season, Chester remained as a semi-professional club, despite the presence of a number of full-time clubs in the Conference Premier.<ref name="Neil Young warns fans to be realistic as Blues resist temptation to switch to full-time football ">{{cite web |url=http://www.chesterfirst.co.uk/news/119172/chester-fc-to-stay-part-time.aspx |title=Neil Young warns fans to be realistic as Blues resist temptation to switch to full-time football |deadurl=no |accessdate=22 January 2013}}</ref> Before the season, bookmakers had high expectations for the Blues, with bookmakers making them eighth favourites for the Conference title.<ref name="Bookies list Chester FC at 16/1 for the title">{{cite web |url=http://www.chesterfirst.co.uk/sport/122731/bookies-list-chester-fc-at-16-1-for-the-title.aspx|title=Bookies list Chester FC at 16/1 for the title |deadurl=no |accessdate=27 August 2013}}</ref> However, the season started with the Blues in terrible form, with five consecutive defeats, including a 2–0 home defeat to fellow part-timers [[Woking_F.C.|Woking]] after the visitors played the entire second half with ten men.

==會徽與隊色==
===會徽===
車士打的會徽由居於[[切斯特|切斯特]]的平面設計師兼車士打球迷马丁·赫胥黎（Martin Huxley）設計<ref name="chester-crest">{{cite web|language=en|url=http://files.pitchero.com/clubs/6069/storyofthelogo.pdf|title=Story of the logo|publisher=''files.pitchero.com''|accessdate=29 May 2010}}</ref>，他解釋當中的原素：『[[狼|狼]]可以追溯至當[[威廉一世_(英格兰)|征服者威廉]]的侄兒休·德·阿夫朗什（Hugh d'Avranches）獲任命為切斯特伯爵（Earl of Chester），他的綽號是「''Lupus''」，是[[拉丁语|拉丁语]]「狼」的意思。而「[[皇冠|皇冠]]」意指切斯特是保皇城市。不同會徽的變化令到兩側的葉片可能是代表勝利的[[月桂|月桂]]，或是在切斯特隨處可的[[栎属|橡樹]]。而橡樹葉長久以來用於柴郡团（Cheshire Regiment）的徽號，源於1743年軍團於[[德廷根战役|德廷根战役]]在橡樹下救回[[乔治二世_(英国)|喬治二世]]一命。』<ref name="chester-crest"/>。

為了與會徽女土維持一致性，車士打採用一隻稱為「''Big Lupus''」友善的狼作為[[吉祥物|吉祥物]]<ref name="Speculation rife over the identity of Chester FC mascot Big Lupus">{{cite web| language=en| url=http://www.flintshirechronicle.co.uk/flintshire-news/local-flintshire-news/2011/01/20/speculation-rife-over-the-identity-of-chester-fc-mascot-big-lupus-51352-28016171/| title=Speculation rife over the identity of Chester FC mascot Big Lupus| work=''flintshirechronicle.co.uk''| accessdate=26 January 2012| archive-date=2013-04-20| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130420041735/http://www.flintshirechronicle.co.uk/flintshire-news/local-flintshire-news/2011/01/20/speculation-rife-over-the-identity-of-chester-fc-mascot-big-lupus-51352-28016171/| dead-url=no}}</ref>。
