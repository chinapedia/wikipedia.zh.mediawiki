===領隊===
<!--
====班士利====
In 1993 he joined Barnsley on a [[free_transfer_(football)|free transfer]]. 12 months later his management career began, becoming player-manager of Barnsley whose previous manager [[Viv_Anderson|Viv Anderson]] had been appointed assistant manager to [[Bryan_Robson|Bryan Robson]] at [[Middlesbrough_F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. Anderson had brought Wilson to Barnsley.

In 1994–95, Barnsley finished sixth in [[Football_League_First_Division|Division One]]. In an ordinary season this would have meant occupying a playoff place, but due to the [[Premier_League|Premier League]] reducing from 22 to 20 clubs, only two teams would be promoted (with fifth placed club occupying the final playoff place) and Barnsley missed out. The following season was a disappointment as the club finished mid-table.

In the following season, 1996–97, Wilson guided Barnsley to the Premier League as Division One runners-up. It was the first time that the 125-year-old Barnsley Football Club had won promotion to the top division of English football. Although their stay lasted only a single season before relegation, Wilson's side reached the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] quarter finals knocking out favourites [[Manchester_United_F.C.|Manchester United]] in the fifth round.

====錫周三====
In the summer of 1998, Wilson returned to his old club [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] as manager and was hopeful of revitalising the club's fortunes. They had just finished 16th in the Premier League and five seasons earlier, when Wilson was still on the club's playing staff, they had reached both domestic cup finals and finished sixth in the first ever Premier League.

In 1998–99, Wilson guided Sheffield Wednesday to a respectable 12th place in the Premier League and had hopes for a top half finish the following season. But he was sacked the following March, having led the club only toward relegation.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Owls sack Wilson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sport/football/fa_carling_premiership/685121.stm |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 March 2000 |accessdate=21 March 2000 }}</ref> Four Sheffield based MPs including [[David_Blunkett|David Blunkett]] called for his head in January 2000 (he picked up the Premier League's [[FA_Premier_League_Manager_of_the_Month|Manager of the Month]] award in January 2000) following some poor results like losing 8–0 to [[Newcastle_United|Newcastle United]]. [[Bassetlaw_(UK_Parliament_constituency)|Bassetlaw]] MP [[Joseph_Ashton_(politician)|Joe Ashton]] said after his sacking: "Danny was a lovely fellow, but he couldn't do it (manage Sheffield Wednesday).<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink=|coauthors= |title=Wilson sacking inevitable – MPs |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/685422.stm |work= |publisher=BBC News |date=21 March 2000 |accessdate=21 March 2000 }}</ref>

====布里斯托城====
In June 2000, Wilson was appointed manager of [[Football_League_Second_Division|Division Two]] [[Bristol_City_F.C.|Bristol City]] on a four-year contract. His contract expired at the end of the 2003–04 season, and was not renewed because he had failed to achieve promotion after several seasons.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors=|title=Wilson leaves Robins post |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_city/3778575.stm |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 June 2004 |accessdate=5 June 2004 }}</ref>

====米爾頓凱恩斯====
In December 2004, Wilson took over from [[Stuart_Murdoch_(football_manager)|Stuart Murdoch]] as the new manager of the controversial [[Football_League_One|Coca Cola League One]] side [[Milton_Keynes_Dons_F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Wilson named Milton Keynes boss|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wimbledon/4076585.stm |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=7 December 2004 }}</ref> In his first season, he managed to save the club from relegation – they would have gone down had it not been for a 10-point penalty imposed on [[Wrexham_A.F.C.|Wrexham]] who had gone into receivership.

Wilson was unable to save MK Dons from relegation to [[Football_League_Two|League Two]] at the end of the 2005–06 season, and he was sacked on 10 May 2006.<ref>{{cite news|first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=MK Dons part company with Wilson |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wimbledon/4760117.stm |work=|publisher=BBC Sport |date=10 May 2006 |accessdate=10 May 2006 }}</ref>

====哈特普爾====
On 13 June 2006, Wilson was appointed manager of [[Hartlepool_United_F.C.|Hartlepool United]].<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Wilson appointed Hartlepool boss |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hartlepool_united/5044758.stm |work= |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 June 2006 |accessdate=13 June 2006 }}</ref> Wilson took over from Youth Team Coach [[Paul_Stephenson_(footballer)|Paul Stephenson]] who took temporary charge of the First Team for the late stages of the 2005–06 season. Hartlepool United were relegated alongside MK Dons to League Two.

In the [[2006-07_in_English_football|2006–07 season]], he brought Hartlepool to second from top of League 2 and won promotion back to League 1.

He left Hartlepool United on 15 December 2008, leaving Chris Turner in temporary charge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hartlepool_united/7784326.stm |title=Hartlepool dismiss manager Wilson |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=15 December 2008|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

====史雲頓====
Appointed manager of [[Swindon_Town_F.C.|Swindon Town]] on 26 December 2008, Wilson saved the team from relegation that season. Wilson brought in many new signings, including[[Gordon_Greer|Gordon Greer]], [[Alan_O'Brien|Alan O'Brien]], [[Jonathan_Douglas|Jonathan Douglas]], [[David_Lucas_(footballer)|David Lucas]] and [[Charlie_Austin|Charlie Austin]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/7800303.stm |title=Wilson appointed Swindon manager |date=26 December 2008 |accessdate=26 December 2008|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> After getting Swindon into the 10 League 1 Play-off Final, the club lost 0–1 against [[Millwall_F.C.|Millwall F.C.]].

The following 2009–10 play-off season saw Wilson and club chairman Andrew Fitton forge many relationships with Premier League and SPL sides, most notably [[Liverpool_F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester_City_F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Celtic_F.C.|Celtic]], who all loaned Wilson players to aid his development of the squad. Wilson released youth team goalkeeper [[Jamie_Stephens|Jamie Stephens]] to the Liverpool youth academy, who in turn loaned Swindon [[Stephen_Darby|Stephen Darby]], who later scored the winning penalty that put Swindon through to the 2009–10 play-off final. [[Simon_Ferry|Simon Ferry]] and [[Paul_Caddis|Paul Caddis]] were loaned from Celtic, both having since been signed on permanent deals from the club. Wilson loaned Manchester City striker [[David_Ball_(footballer)|David Ball]] for the 2010–11 season. On 2 March 2011, Wilson resigned his post after a poor run of form that had seen the club slip into the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swindon_town/9412294.stm|title=Danny Wilson quits as Swindon Town manager|publisher=BBC News|date=2 March 2011|accessdate=2 March 2011}}</ref>

====錫菲聯====
On 27 May 2011, Wilson was appointed the manager of [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United]]. The appointment was greeted with some dissatisfaction amongst the Blades support, as approximately 400 fans gathered outside [[Bramall_Lane|Bramall Lane]] to voice their anger at the appointment, particularly considering his links as a former player and manager of bitter rivals [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. Disapproving chants against his appointment could be heard throughout the announcing press conference. Wilson's subsequent statements suggested that he already felt the pressure resultant from having crossed the divide. As part of the restructure of the Blades managerial setup, captain [[Chris_Morgan_(English_footballer)|Chris Morgan]] was promoted to a player-coach position. Morgan had played under Wilson during his earlier years at Barnsley. A couple of weeks later, Wilson appointed the Sheffield-born former Blades player and well respected coach [[Frank_Barlow_(footballer)|Frank Barlow]] as his assistant.<ref name="Wilson Blades">{{cite news|title=Danny Wilson unveiled as Sheffield United manager|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13564627.stm|accessdate=27 May 2011|publisher=BBC Sport|date=27 May 2011}}</ref>

Wilson made a positive start at the Blades, winning his first league game in charge with a 2–0 victory over [[Oldham_Athletic_A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]]. This was then followed up by a [[Football_League_Cup|Football League Cup]] victory over [[Hartlepool_United_F.C.|Hartlepool United]] and a 2–0 home victory over[[Brentford_F.C.|Brentford]] in Wilson's first home league game. Wilson was named [[Football_League_One|Football League One]] manager of the month for December 2011 after managing the Blades to league victories over [[Rochdale_F.C.|Rochdale]], [[A.F.C._Bournemouth|A.F.C. Bournemouth]], [[Notts_County_F.C.|Notts County]] and [[Hartlepool_United_F.C.|Hartlepool United]]. Despite the Blades scoring 92 league goals and accumulating 90 points (finishing 3rd) in Wilson's first season in charge, the team lost on penalties in the 2011–12 League One play-off final against [[Huddersfield_Town_F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].

Wilson won the League One manager of the month award for October 2012 after guiding the Blades into the automatic promotion places, including a 19 game unbeaten run in all competitions. However, six months later he left Sheffield United on 10 April 2013 following a poor run of form. <ref name="Wilson Blades">{{cite news|title=Danny Wilson unveiled as Sheffield United manager|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2307063/Sheffield-United-sack-Danny-Wilson.html|accessdate=27 May 2011|publisher=Daily Mail|date=27 May 2011}}</ref>
