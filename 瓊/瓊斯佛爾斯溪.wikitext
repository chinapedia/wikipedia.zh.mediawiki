'''瓊斯佛爾斯溪'''（Jones Falls）位於[[美國|美國]][[馬里蘭州|馬里蘭州]]，長{{convert|17.9|mi|km|adj=mid}}<ref name=NHD>U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. [http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ The National Map]  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/66gupqQDM?url=http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ |date=2012-04-05 }}, accessed April 1, 2011</ref>。本溪建有水壩，形成{{tsl|en|Lake Roland (Maryland)|羅蘭湖}}，流經巴爾的摩市，注入巴爾的摩的內港。

與其英文名字所暗示的不同，本溪僅有少數不算大的瀑布。瓊斯佛爾斯溪谷長久以來是巴爾的摩的重要運輸管道。沿著河谷有佛爾斯路（Falls Road）、[[美鐵|美鐵]]的東北走廊的軌道、[[83號州際公路|83號州際公路]]（又稱Jones Falls Expressway (JFX)），以及[[巴爾的摩輕軌|巴爾的摩輕軌]]。巴爾的摩的賓州車站也位於河邊。有許多橋梁跨越本溪，而83號州際公路常常就直接蓋在河流之上。

==Course==
The Jones Falls begins as a small stream in [[Baltimore_County|Baltimore County]] near [[Garrison,_Maryland|Garrison]] at the intersection of Caves and Garrison Road (39.41771° -76.75750°).<ref name="NHD" />  It travels southeast for {{convert|3.3|mi}}<ref name="NHD" /> before joining the North Branch Jones Falls stream near [[Stevenson,_Maryland|Stevenson]] (39.41225° -76.70937°).<ref name="NHD" />  North Branch Jones Falls originates near [[Worthington,_Maryland|Worthington]]<ref name="NHD" /> by the intersection of Park Heights Avenue and Walnut Avenue (39.46135° -76.75057°).<ref name="NHD" />  The North Branch travels south for {{convert|5.2|mi}}<ref name="NHD" /> before joining Jones Falls stream. The falls then travels east for {{convert|1.3|mi}} before [[Dipping_Pond_Run|Dipping Pond Run]] joins at ( 39.41424° -76.68557°).<ref name="NHD" />  The Jones Falls continues east another {{convert|0.8|mi}} before [[Deep_Run|Deep Run]] intersects near [[Brooklandville,_Maryland|Brooklandville]] (39.41467° -76.67060°).<ref name="NHD" />  The stream then continues south along [[Interstate_83|Interstate 83]] (I-83), which is named the Jones Falls Expressway, for {{convert|1.7|mi}} until it [[Slaughterhouse_Branch|Slaughterhouse Branch]] and [[Moores_Branch|Moores Branch]] join it next to the I-83 overpass over [[Maryland_Route_25|Maryland Route 25]] (MD 25, Falls Road) (39.39587° -76.66442°).<ref name="NHD" />  The Jones Falls travels southeast for {{convert|1.5|mi}}, passing through [[Robert_E._Lee_Park|Robert E. Lee Park]], until it meets [[Lake_Roland_(Maryland)|Lake Roland]], an impounding of the stream. (39.39069° -76.64639°)<ref name="NHD" />  In Lake Roland, [[Roland_Run|Roland Run]] and [[Towson_Run|Towson Run]] both join.<ref name="NHD" />  Once it leaves Lake Roland, the Jones Falls becomes a small river.

Not long after leaving the lake, the Jones Falls enters [[Baltimore|Baltimore]] directly underneath an intersection of Interstate 83 and the [[Baltimore_Light_Rail|Baltimore Light Rail]]'s mainline, with both routes beginning to parallel I-83.<ref name="NHD" />  For the remainder of the Jones Falls' course, I-83 enters the Jones Falls valley, where it constantly crosses over, parallels, and covers the river.  Another half mile after entering the city, [[Western_Run|Western Run]] joins near [[Mount_Washington,_Baltimore|Mount Washington]] (39.36717° -76.64835°).<ref name="NHD" />  The Jones Falls, I-83, and the Light Rail continue south for 4.4 miles before the last major stream, [[Stony_Run_(Maryland)|Stony Run]], empties into the stream near [[Druid_Hill_Park|Druid Hill Park]] (39.31683° -76.62672°).<ref name="NHD" />  Along the way, MD 25 enters the valley, running parallel to the river opposite of the highway and rail lines.  MD 25 is also paralleled by the [[Jones_Falls_Trail|Jones Falls Trail]].  About a quarter mile before it intersects Stony Run, the Jones Falls goes over a ten foot waterfall named "Round Falls".<ref name="American Whitewater">[http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/River/detail/id/3579], American Whitewater Jones Falls - Lake Roland to Round Falls.</ref>

About {{convert|0.6|mi}} after Stony Run, and after passing by the [[Baltimore_Streetcar_Museum|Baltimore Streetcar Museum]], the [[CSXT|CSXT]]-operated [[Baltimore_Belt_Line|Baltimore Belt Line]] bridges the river, bound for the [[Howard_Street_Tunnel|Howard Street Tunnel]].  The Jones Falls then immediately passes underneath [[U.S._Route_1_in_Maryland|North Avenue]].  Just south of North Avenue, the [[Amtrak|Amtrak]] [[Northeast_Corridor|Northeast Corridor]] enters the valley upon exiting the [[Baltimore_and_Potomac_Tunnel|Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel]] and bridging the Jones Falls, with Howard Street Bridge directly above this intersection.  MD 25 ends shortly after, with the Jones Falls Trail joining city streets, and the Light Rail also leaves the valley to join Howard Street.  After the rapid succession of bridges, the Jones Falls almost immediately enters a tunnel, the Jones Falls Conduit, which curves to flow directly underneath I-83 (39.30896° -76.61964°).<ref name="NHD" />  After passing by [[Pennsylvania_Station_(Baltimore)|Baltimore's Pennsylvania Station]], situated directly in the valley, the Northeast Corridor exits the valley, and the Jones Falls Conduit and I-83 curve sharply to the south.  The river and highway continue to Fayette Street.  Here, I-83 ends; two block south of this point, the Jones Falls exits the conduit and flows several more blocks before it empties into the east side of the [[Inner_Harbor|Inner Harbor]] (39.28657° -76.60457°).<ref name="NHD" />
