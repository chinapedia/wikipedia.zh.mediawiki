左前降支動脈
It passes at first behind the [[肺動脈|pulmonary artery]] and then comes forward between that vessel and the [[心房|left auricula]] to reach the {{tsl|en|anterior interventricular sulcus||anterior interventricular sulcus}}, along which it descends to the {{tsl|en|incisura apicis cordis||incisura apicis cordis}}. 

Although rare, multiple anomalous courses of the LAD have been described. These include the origin of the artery from the right sinus of {{tsl|en|Aortic sinus||valsalva}}.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ropers|first1=D.|title=Anomalous Course of the Left Main or Left Anterior Descending Coronary Artery Originating From the Right Sinus of Valsalva: Identification of Four Common Variations by Electron Beam Tomography|journal=Circulation|date=12 February 2002|volume=105|issue=6|pages=42e–43|doi=10.1161/hc0602.102020}}</ref>

In 78% of cases, it reaches the [[心臟|apex of the heart]].

===Branches===
The LAD gives off two types of branches: ''septals'' and ''diagonals''.  
* Septals originate from the LAD at 90 degrees to the surface of the heart, perforating and supplying the anterior 2/3rds of the {{tsl|en|interventricular septum||interventricular septum}}. 
* Diagonals run along the surface of the heart and supply the lateral wall of the [[心室|left ventricle]] and the anterolateral {{tsl|en|papillary muscle||papillary muscle}}.

==Function==
The artery supplies the anterolateral [[心肌|myocardium]], apex, and {{tsl|en|interventricular septum||interventricular septum}}. The LAD typically supplies 45-55% of the [[心室|left ventricle]] (LV) and is therefore considered the most critical vessel in terms of myocardial blood supply.

[[心电图|EKG]] changes associated with left anterior descending territory ischemia include ST segment changes in leads V1-V4, 1 and AVL.{{cit|date=February 2015}}

This term is used because the left main coronary, and/or the left anterior descending supply blood to large areas of the heart. This means that if these arteries are abruptly and completely occluded it will cause a massive [[心肌梗死|heart attack]] that will likely lead to sudden death. The blockage that kills is made up of [[血小板|platelets]] streaming to the site of a ruptured cholesterol plaque. Even a small amount of plaque in this area can (for a variety of poorly understood reasons) rupture and cause death; [[冠状动脉旁路移植|bypassing]] chronic blockages or trying to open them up with [[血管再成形術|angioplasty]] does not prevent heart attack but it can restore blood flow in case of a sudden blockage or heart attack and if performed within a rapid time period can minimize the damage done. An example of the devastating results of a complete occlusion of the LAD artery was the sudden death of former NBC News Washington Bureau Chief [[提姆·拉瑟特|Tim Russert]].<ref name="morg">{{cite news

From the minute a widow maker heart attack hits, survival time ranges from minutes to several hours. Rapidly progressing symptoms should signal the need for immediate attention. Symptoms of initial onset may include nausea, shortness of breath, pain in the head, jaw, arms or chest, numbness in fingers, often of a novel but imprecise sensation which builds with irregular heart beat. Early symptoms may be mistaken for food poisoning, flu or general malaise until they intensify. A widow maker cannot kill instantly but induces cardiac arrest which may do so within 10 to 20 minutes of no circulation. A victim with no pulse or breath is still alive, living off oxygen stored in the blood and may be able to be rescued if treatment is begun promptly within this window.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kearl | first = Mary | title = Surviving a Widow-Maker Heart Attack |  publisher = AOL Health | date = June 2009 | url = http://www.aolhealth.com/condition-center/heart-disease/surviving-a-heart-attack | accessdate = June 2009}}</ref> -->
