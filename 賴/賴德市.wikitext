<!--On 2 September 2009, one week before the 2009 mayoral election, Liberal mayor Vic Tagg resigned from the Liberal Party, bringing the number of independents to 5, and the Liberals down to 3.<ref>http://northern-district-times.whereilive.com.au/news/comments/shock-switch/</ref>

During the weeks leading to the vote for the Ryde City Mayoralty, Cr Tagg was unable to secure the support of sufficient councillors in retaining the mayoralty. As the Independent councillors were required for the Liberal candidate to secure the mayoralty, the Liberals moved to support Cr Etmekdjian who 3 of the 4 Independents were willing to support. 

At the Ryde City Council meeting on 8 September 2009, Cr Tagg supported the Labor candidate Cr Butterworth for the mayoralty, joining Cr Li and the Labor councillors. The 6-6 split forced a hat draw, which Cr Butterworth won. <ref>{{cite web|title=The City of Ryde Council minutes. 8 September 2009|url=http://www.ryde.nsw.gov.au/WEB_SITE_KNOWLEDGEBASE/MEETINGS/Council_2/Minutes_3/2009_1980/gm1509_080909m_2166.pdf}}</ref>
