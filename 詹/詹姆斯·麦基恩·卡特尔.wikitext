'''詹姆斯·麦基恩·卡特尔'''（'''James McKeen Cattell'''，1860年5月25日-1944年1月20日）是一位[[美国|美国]][[心理学家|心理学家]]，[[宾夕法尼亚大学|宾夕法尼亚大学]]的第一位心理学教授。  

在他的事业开始时，许多科学家将心理学看作一门辅修学科，甚或是一门类似于[[颅相学|颅相学]]的伪科学。<!-- Perhaps more than any of his contemporaries, Cattell helped establish psychology as a legitimate science, worthy of study at the highest levels of the academy.  At the time of his death, the ''New York Times'' hailed him as "the dean of American science."  Yet Cattell may be best remembered for his uncompromising opposition to American involvement in [[World_War_I|World War I]].  His public opposition to the draft led to his dismissal from his position at [[哥伦比亚大学|哥伦比亚大学]], a move that later led many American universities to establish [[tenure|tenure]] as a means of protecting unpopular beliefs. -->

==早年生活==
1860年5月25日，詹姆斯·麦基恩·卡特尔出生于美国宾夕法尼亚州的Easton<!-- Cattell grew up the eldest child of a wealthy and prominent family.  His father, William Cassady Cattell, a [[Presbyterian|Presbyterian]] minister, became president of [[Lafayette_College|Lafayette College]] in Easton, Pennsylvania shortly after James' birth.  William Cattell could easily provide for his children, as he had married Elizabeth "Lizzie" McKeen in 1859; together they shared Lizzie's substantial inheritance.  To this picture of the family's success one could add political power as well, as James' uncle [[Alexander_Gilmore_Cattell|Alexander Gilmore Cattell]]代表[[New_Jersey|New Jersey]] in the [[美国参议院|美国参议院]].  

1876年，16岁的卡特尔进入Lafayette College，and graduated in four years with the highest honors.  In [[1883|1883]] the faculty at Lafayette awarded him an M.A., again with highest honors.  Despite his later renown as a scientist, he spent most of his time devouring [[English_literature|English literature]], although he showed a remarkable gift for [[mathematics|mathematics]] as well. -->

<!-- Cattell did not find his calling until after he arrived in [[德国|德国]] for graduate studies, where he met [[威廉·冯特|威廉·冯特]] 在[[莱比锡大学|莱比锡大学]].  Cattell left Germany in [[1882|1882]] to study at [[Johns_Hopkins_University|Johns Hopkins University]], but returned to [[Leipzig|Leipzig]] the next year as Wundt's assistant. The partnership between the men proved highly productive, as the two helped to establish the formal study of [[intelligence_(trait)|intelligence]].  Under Wundt, Cattell became the first American to publish a dissertation in the field of psychology, ''Psychometric Investigation''.  More controversially, Cattell tried to explore the interiors of his own mind through the consumption of the then-legal drug [[hashish|hashish]].  Under the influence of this drug, Cattell once compared the whistling of a schoolboy to a [[symphony_orchestra|symphony orchestra]].  While recreational drug use was not uncommon among early psychologists, including [[Freud|Freud]], Cattell's experimentation with hashish reflected a willingness to go against conventional opinion and morality. -->

<!-- The main street in the College Hill Neighborhood of Easton, Pennsylvania, home to Lafayette College, is name after Catell. -->

==学术生涯==
卡特尔在德国获得博士学位后回到美国，1887年担任心理学讲师，Bryn Mawr；1888年担任[[宾夕法尼亚大学|宾夕法尼亚大学]]心理学教授；1891年-1905年，担任[[哥伦比亚大学|哥伦比亚大学]]心理学、[[人类学|人类学]]与[[哲学|哲学]]系主任；1895年担任美国心理学会主席。

<!-- <span style="color: ColorName;">From the beginning of his career,卡特尔努力工作，establish psychology as a field as worthy of study as any of the "hard" 自然科学，such as chemistry or physics.  Indeed, 他相信进一步的调查 would reveal that the intellect itself could be parsed into standard units of measurements. He also brought the methods of [[Francis_Galton|Francis Galton]] back to the United States, establishing the mental testing efforts in the U.S. The money he won from his tenure lawsuit was used to establish [[Harcourt_Assessment|The Psychological Corporation]], one of the largest mental testing firms in the U.S.</span> -->

<!-- ==Journals==
Cattell is well known for his involvement in creating and editing scientific journals. He was so involved in owning and publishing journals, that his research productivity declined. He founded the journal ''[[Psychological_Review|Psychological Review]]'' in 1894.  He also acquired the journal ''[[Science|Science]]'' and, within five years, made it the official publication of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1895-1900.  In 1904, he also founded ''Popular Science Monthly'', which later became ''[[Popular_Science|Popular Science]]''. In 1915 he founded and edited [[Scientific_monthly|Scientific Monthly]]. -->
