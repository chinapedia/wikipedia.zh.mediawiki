'''互聯網驗證服務'''({{lang|en|'''Internet Authentication Service'''}}，簡寫'''IAS''')是[[微軟|微軟]]對[[RADIUS|RADIUS]]服務的實現，是一種中央處理的用戶驗證系統。<!--
 provides centralized user authentication and authorization, centralized auditing and accounting.
While [[Routing_and_Remote_Access_Service|Routing and Remote Access Service]] (RRAS) security is sufficient for small networks, a large enterprise often needs a dedicated infrastructure for authentication. [[Radius_server|RADIUS]] is a standard for dedicated authentication servers. [[Windows_Server_2003|Windows Server 2003]] includes Microsoft Internet Authentication Service (IAS), an implementation of RADIUS server. IAS supports authentication for Windows-based clients, as well as for third-party clients that adhere to the RADIUS standard. IAS stores its authentication information in [[Active_Directory|Active Directory]] (AD), and you can manage it with Remote Access Policies.
While IAS requires the use of an additional server component, it provides a number of advantages over the standard methods of RRAS authentication. These advantages include centralized authentication for users, auditing and accounting features, scalability, and seamless integration with the existing features of RRAS.

==Logging==
By default, IAS logs to local files (%systemroot%\LogFiles\IAS\*) though it can be configured to log to [[SQL|SQL]] as well (or in place of).

When logging to SQL, IAS appears to wrap the data into [[Extensible_Markup_Language|XML]], then calls the stored procedure report_event, passing the XML data as ntext... the stored procedure can then unwrap the XML and save data as desired by the user.
