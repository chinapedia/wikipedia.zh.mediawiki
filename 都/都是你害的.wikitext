<!--==劇情==
After Princess Bubblegum (voiced by [[Hynden_Walch|Hynden Walch]]) discovers that the Earl of Lemongrab (voiced by [[Justin_Roiland|Justin Roiland]]) is watching her subjects while they sleep. She confronts the Earl, who complains that he has no one to govern. He then has a [[mental_breakdown|mental breakdown]], accusing Bubblegum of being "his [[god|glob]]". Bubblegum sends the Pup Gang, a band of delinquent youth, to Lemongrab's castle, but their unruly attitude causes them to incur the ire of the Earl. Lemongrab subsequently returns to watching the candy citizens as they sleep.

Princess Bubblegum, Finn, and Jake journey to Castle Lemongrab to try and help the Earl and save the Pup Gang. Finn and Jake find the youths in a "Reconditioning Chamber" that shocks anyone inside of it. Lemongrab soon presents himself, and tries to recondition Finn and Jake. Just when he is about to harm Bubblegum with his soundsword, a clone of Lemongrab, Lemongrab 2, walks into the room. Bubblegum explains that she made him to be the original Lemongrab's companion, so that he would not be so lonely.
