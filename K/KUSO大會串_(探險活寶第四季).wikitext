〈'''KUSO大會串'''〉（{{lang-en|''Five Short Graybles''}}）是《[[探險活寶|探險活寶]]》[[探險活寶_(第四季)|第四季]]的第2集。在[[卡通頻道|卡通頻道]]2012年4月9日播出。這集是一系列短篇故事，有嗶莫、[[阿寶·馬頓斯|阿寶]]和[[酷狗老皮|老皮]]、泡泡糖公主、冰霸王和腫泡泡公主，都是關於五感的主題，由一個來自未來、名叫「起司塊」（Cuber）的角色講述。

<!--==劇情==
The episode begins with a futuristic character named Cuber (voiced by [[Emo_Philips|Emo Philips]]) [[breaking_the_fourth_wall|announcing to the audience]] that they will be watching five short [[Vignette_(literature)|vignette]]s, and that they have to guess the theme.

The first short focuses on BMO (voiced by [[Niki_Yang|Niki Yang]]), who talks to itself in the mirror, pretending as if it is talking to another character named "Football". BMO insists that it is a real, living boy, and attempts to demonstrate this to Football by brushing its teeth and using the toilet. Unbeknownst to BMO, Finn and Jake are watching the activity from outside a window. The focus then shifts to Finn and Jake, who attempt to experience the ultimate [[high_five|high five]]. Eventually, Finn places himself in a catapult, and Jake stretches himself into a slingshot, and the two launch themselves across Ooo.

The next vignette focuses on Princess Bubblegum (voiced by [[Hynden_Walch|Hynden Walch]]) as she struggles to scientifically create the ideal sandwich. After exhausting herself going to extreme and ridiculous lengths to produce and combine all the ingredients perfectly, she offers the sandwich to Cinnamon Bun (voiced by [[Dee_Bradley_Baker|Dee Bradley Baker]]), who merely shoves it into his pastry body and belches foodstuff onto the princess, much to her dismay. The action then shifts to the Ice King (voiced by [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]]), who smells a stench in his ice castle. After mistakenly assuming that the smell was being caused by Gunter the penguin's flatulence, the Ice King realizes that his armpits, in fact, are the source of the smell. After taking a shower, he ponders aloud as to how he got so smelly. Gunter then proceeds to flatulate underneath his arms.

The final vignette focuses on Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]]) as she attempts to win a talent show by singing a song entitled "These Lumps". Before she can perform, however, a group of candy citizens steal her song. Lumpy Space Princess becomes enraged and throws a basketball into the audience, which hits and audience member and accidentally but impressively makes a basket in the process. Due to the impressiveness of this action, Peppermint Butler (voiced by [[Steve_Little_(actor)|Steve Little]]) names her the winner. Just then, Finn and Jake collide in mid-air, producing a high five that reverberates across Ooo. The duo are named the winner, much to Lumpy Space Princess' chagrin.

The episode comes to a close with Cuber revealing that the theme was the [[five_senses|five senses]]: BMO saw Football in the mirror, Finn and Jake touched each other's hands, Princess Bubblegum made a tasty sandwich, Ice King smelled something foul, and Lumpy Space Princess heard music.

"Five Short Graybles" was written and storyboarded by [[Tom_Herpich|Tom Herpich]], [[Skyler_Page|Skyler Page]], and [[Cole_Sanchez|Cole Sanchez]], from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]]. The episode was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref name=episodecreditsgraybles>{{cite episode| title=Five Short Graybles|series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Tom Herpich, Skyler Page, & Cole Sanchez (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=April 9, 2012| season = 4 | number = 2}}</ref> This was the first episode that Page worked on for the series; he was so excited that after he finished the storyboard, he travelled to Hawaii to "treat himself".<ref name=skylergraybles>Page, Skyler (Storyboard artist). 2014.

He later jokingly said via his [[Twitter|Twitter]] that he would make an episode entirely about high-fives, and this joke turned into the first act of "Five Short Graybles". In fact, Page had been hired by Ward largely due to how he storyboarded the first high-five between Finn and Jake, which Ward found humorous.<ref name=wardgraybles>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014.

He later noted that the two sections were united by the fact that they both featured characters who were "being a little bit mean" to others.<ref name=colegraybles>Sanchez, Cole (Storyboard artist). 2014.

Originally, it was planned for live action footage of Ward to appear in the episode; he would have introduced each clip, serving as a framing device. This idea, however, was eventually vetoed. Herpich came up with the idea to replace Ward with a futuristic man named Cuber. Furthermore, Herpich crafted Cuber's dialogue so that it would sound like it was a "dialect from thousand of years in the future". As such, the word "graybles" is a supposed distortion of the word "fables".<ref name=herpichgraybles>Herpich, Tom (Storyboard artist). 2014.
