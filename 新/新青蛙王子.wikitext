<!--Plot ==
During a rainy day, Finn and Jake are approached by a mudscamp named Woobeewoo (voiced by Kent Osborne), who pleads with the heroes to help save his village. Agreeing to help, Finn and Jake appear before the village elder (voiced by Jonathan Katz) who reveals that their community is under attack by a giant Mega Frog that apparently tries to eat them. Finn and Jake agree to find the beast and stop it, and they set off.

While in the forest, Finn and Jake think they see the Mega Frog, but it turns out to be a wooden effigy. However, behind them, the Mega Frog appears, and he attempts to eat them. Finn and Jake flee into a cave, but the frog gives chase. Then and there, Finn realizes that the frog is not trying to eat them, but rather kiss them; Finn summons up his courage and leaps towards the frog, giving him a kiss that turns the monster into Prince Huge (voiced by Brian Doyle-Murray). The prince thanks the two, noting that he had been cursed for some time, even though he had tried to break his own curse.

Oliver Sava of ''[[影音俱樂部|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode an "A–", writing that it "shows exactly why this show has become so successful with variations on that central idea."<ref name="avclubfrog">{{cite web|last1 = Sava|first1 = Oliver|title = Review: Adventure Time: 'The Hard Easy'|url = http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-the-hard-easy-85483|website = [[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]|publisher = [[The_Onion|The Onion]]|accessdate = September 12, 2014|date = October 1, 2012}}</ref> He felt that while the episode was not "too crazy for the milestone story" the "simple yet striking character designs, stylized dialogue, intense action, clever comedy, and generally chill atmosphere combine to create a delightful burst of animated whimsy, light and frothy but still substantial."<ref name="avclubfrog">{{cite web|last1 = Sava|first1 = Oliver|title = Review: Adventure Time: 'The Hard Easy'|url = http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-the-hard-easy-85483|website = [[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]|publisher = [[The_Onion|The Onion]]|accessdate = September 12, 2014|date = October 1, 2012}}</ref> Sava argued that the episode took elements from the fairy tales ''[[糖果屋|Hansel and Gretel]]'' and ''[[青蛙王子|The Frog Prince]]'', but managed to tweak and change them "through this show's psychedelic toilet filter".<ref name="avclubfrog">{{cite web|last1 = Sava|first1 = Oliver|title = Review: Adventure Time: 'The Hard Easy'|url = http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-the-hard-easy-85483|website = [[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
