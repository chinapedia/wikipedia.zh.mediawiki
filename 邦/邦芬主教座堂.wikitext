The veneration of ''Nosso Senhor do Bonfim'' (Our Lord of the Good End, represented by the crucified [[Jesus|Jesus]] in the moment of his death) is an old tradition in [[Portugal|Portugal]] that was imported to Brazil during [[Colonial_Brazil|colonial times]]. In 1740, in order to fulfill a vow, Portuguese captain ''Teodósio Rodrigues de Faria'' brought a statue of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim from [[Setúbal|Setúbal]] (Portugal) to Salvador. Some years later a religious brotherhood (''irmandade'') dedicated to Our Lord of Bonfim was founded and a church to house the statue - the current Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim - began being built on top of Montserrat hill, in the Itapagipe peninsula, in the lower town of Salvador. The church was inaugurated in 1754, with the towers being finished around 1772.

The façade of the church is two-dimensional, with a central body flanked by two towers. The windows and specially the elaborate [[volute|volute]]s of the [[gable|gable]] on top of the façade follow a [[Rococo|Rococo]] (late [[Baroque|Baroque]]) design. The lower parts of the façade were covered by Portuguese white [[tiles|tiles]] ([[azulejo|azulejo]]s) in 1873.

The inner decoration of the church was only finished in the 19th century. The [[Neoclassical|Neoclassical]] main altarpiece, which has the form of a [[baldachin|baldachin]] with a cupola sustained by volutes, was carved and probably also designed by sculptor ''Antônio Joaquim dos Santos'' between 1813 and 1814. The lateral walls of the single-[[aisle|aisle]]d [[nave|nave]] are decorated with several altarpieces.

Another notable feature of the church is the painted wooden ceiling, executed by Bahia artist ''Franco Velasco'' between 1818 and 1820, which shows people thanking Our Lord of Bonfim for having survived a [[shipwreck|shipwreck]]. The [[sacristy|sacristy]], nave and other rooms of the church display paintings by another notable Bahia painter, ''José Teófilo de Jesus'', executed in the 1830s.

In the 19th century, the Bonfim Brotherhood built houses in the square in front of the church to house the [[pilgrim|pilgrim]]s (''romeiros'') that come to Salvador every year to honour Our Lord of Bonfim.

== 缤纷主节（Festa do Senhor do Bonfim） ==
<!--

The ''Festa do Bonfim'' (Feast of Bonfim) is one of the most important annual popular celebrations in Salvador, starting on the second Thursday after [[Three_Kings_Day|Three Kings Day]] (January 6th). On this Thursday, the faithful gather in front of the Church of Conceição da Praia, in downtown Salvador (''Baixa''), including a large group of Bahia ladies (''bahianas'') in traditional white costume, with turbants and long, round skirts. After mass, the faithful take part on a [[procession|procession]] that leaves the Church of Conceição da Praia and, after an 8-km course, reaches the hill of the Bonfim Church. Upon reaching the top, the bahianas wash the steps and the square (''adro'') in front of the church with aromatised water while dancing and singing chants in [[Yoruba_language|Yoruba language]]. The washing ritual is called the ''Lavagem do Bonfim'' (Washing of Bonfim) and attracts a multitude of believers as well as tourists.

The celebrations last ten days and end with a massive [[mass|mass]] in the Bonfim Church. Many worshippers come from far away to honour [[vow|vow]]s taken with Our Lord of Bonfim. The church has a museum of [[ex-voto|ex-voto]]s brought by the worshippers in gratitude after receiving a [[divine_grace|divine grace]]. The feast includes stands serving traditional food, souvenirs, traditional dances and concerts by local musical groups.

Even though the feast is [[Catholic|Catholic]] in its origins, it also reveals much about the religious [[syncretism|syncretism]] between Catholicism and African religions in Bahia. In the [[Candomblé|Candomblé]] religion, Our Lord of Bonfim is associated with [[Oxalá|Oxalá]], father of the [[Orishas|Orishas]] and creator of humankind. Indeed, people dress in white during the feast to honour Oxalá.
