<!-- A [[conurbation|conurbation]] is formed when towns expand sufficiently that their urban areas join up with each other.  This process has happened many times in the [[United_Kingdom|United Kingdom]], with [[London|London]] being the most famous example of this type of development.

[[Green_Belt_(UK)|Green Belt]]s were introduced in the [[20th_century|20th century]] to try to stop new conurbations forming.  Clear conurbations however, exist at 

*[[South_East_Dorset_conurbation|South East Dorset conurbation]] - [[Bournemouth|Bournemouth]], [[Poole|Poole]] and [[Christchurch,_Dorset|Christchurch]] in [[Dorset|Dorset]]

*[[Greater_Glasgow|Greater Glasgow]] (Clydeside conurbation) - [[Glasgow|Glasgow]] and surrounding suburbs, towns and villages
*[[Leeds|Leeds]]/[[Bradford|Bradford]] in [[West_Yorkshire|West Yorkshire]]
*[[London|London]], [[Greater_London_Urban_Area|Greater London Urban Area]] and [[London_commuter_belt|London commuter belt]]
*[[Greater_Manchester_Urban_Area|Greater Manchester Urban Area]], including the city of [[Manchester|Manchester]], [[City_of_Salford|City of Salford]], [[Trafford|Trafford]], [[Stockport|Stockport]], [[Oldham|Oldham]], [[Bolton|Bolton]], [[Tameside|Tameside]].
*[[Medway|Medway]] towns ([[Chatham,_Kent|Chatham]], [[Rochester,_Kent|Rochester]], [[Gillingham,_Medway|Gillingham]])
*[[Greater_Belfast|Greater Belfast]] conurbation, including [[Belfast|Belfast]], [[Lisburn|Lisburn]], [[Newtownabbey|Newtownabbey]], [[North_Down|North Down]] (Bangor), [[Castlereagh|Castlereagh]] and [[Carrickfergus|Carrickfergus]]
*[[Greater_Merseyside|Greater Merseyside]] conurbation, centred on [[Liverpool|Liverpool]] in [[Merseyside|Merseyside]], also includes [[Ellesmere_Port_and_Neston|Ellesmere Port and Neston]], [[Halton_(borough)|Halton]] and [[St_Helens,_Merseyside|St Helens]].
*[[Coventry/Bedworth_Urban_Area|Coventry/Bedworth Urban Area]].
*[[Brighton|Brighton]] urban area ([[Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton|Brighton/Worthing/Littlehampton]]) on the [[Sussex_coast|Sussex coast]], including [[Littlehampton|Littlehampton]], [[Worthing|Worthing]], [[Lancing,_West_Sussex|Lancing]], [[Shoreham-by-Sea|Shoreham-by-Sea]], [[Brighton_&_Hove|Brighton & Hove]]

*[[The_Potteries_Urban_Area|The Potteries Urban Area]], including [[Stoke-on-Trent|Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Newcastle-under-Lyme|Newcastle-under-Lyme]] and [[Kidsgrove|Kidsgrove]].
*[[Nottingham_City_Area|Greater Nottingham]] - including [[Arnold,_Nottinghamshire|Arnold]], [[Hucknall|Hucknall]], [[Beeston,_Nottinghamshire|Beeston]], [[West_Bridgford|West Bridgford]], [[Eastwood,_Nottinghamshire|Eastwood]] and [[Long_Eaton|Long Eaton]]
*[[Greater_Sheffield|Greater Sheffield]] - the [[Sheffield|Sheffield]]/[[Rotherham|Rotherham]]/[[Swinton,_South_Yorkshire|Swinton]]/[[Mexborough|Mexborough]]/[[Doncaster|Doncaster]] area in [[South_Yorkshire|South Yorkshire]]
*[[Greater_Southampton|Greater Southampton]] - including [[Eastleigh|Eastleigh]], [[Hedge_End|Hedge End]], [[Totton_and_Eling|Totton and Eling]], [[Netley|Netley]]

*[[Tyneside|Tyneside]] conurbation, including [[Newcastle_upon_Tyne|Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Gateshead|Gateshead]], [[South_Shields|South Shields]], [[Chester-le-Street|Chester-le-Street]] and [[Washington,_Tyne_and_Wear|Washington]] 
*[[West_Midlands_conurbation|West Midlands conurbation]], including [[Birmingham|Birmingham]], [[Wolverhampton|Wolverhampton]], the [[Black_Country|Black Country]], [[Cannock|Cannock]] and [[Solihull|Solihull]] 

In all of these, regardless of local government, towns that have become part of the conurbation have retained clear identities as separate towns.  In England, some of these are recognised as [[metropolitan_counties|metropolitan counties]] (Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Yorkshire, Tyne and Wear, West Midlands, West Yorkshire), alongside [[Greater_London|Greater London]] which has a similar status.  Others have become unified local government districts (such as Torbay, Medway).

There is a spectrum that can be drawn between the conurbations that have a clear 'head' (such as Nottingham, Portsmouth, Southampton) to those that are do not - known as [[multi-centred_conurbation|multi-centred conurbation]]s (such as Bournemouth/Poole and Teesside) - via ones that are more borderline (Tyne and Wear, West Midlands).  In the case of the West Midlands, for example, the 'centre' city, Birmingham did expand massively and is now considered to include areas that were formerly independent towns, such as [[Sutton_Coldfield|Sutton Coldfield]] and [[Aston,_West_Midlands|Aston]].  However, here it stopped, with the Black Country and Wolverhampton retaining strong identities.

In various parts of the country are more borderline cases, where the areas expanded into did not necessarily have strong identities as towns.  However, the areas do retain separate local government structures, and are therefore considered conurbations by the [[Office_for_National_Statistics|ONS]], on this basis :

*[[Bristol_urban_area|Bristol urban area]] - [[Bristol|Bristol]], [[Kingswood,_South_Gloucestershire|Kingswood]], [[Longwell_Green|Longwell Green]], [[Mangotsfield|Mangotsfield]], [[Frenchay|Frenchay]], [[Downend,_South_Gloucestershire|Downend]], [[Filton|Filton]], [[Bradley_Stoke|Bradley Stoke]], [[Patchway|Patchway]], [[Cribbs_Causeway|Cribbs Causeway]]
*Greater [[Leicester|Leicester]], including [[Birstall,_Leicestershire|Birstall]], [[Syston|Syston]], [[Oadby_and_Wigston|Oadby and Wigston]], [[Glenfield,_Leicestershire|Glenfield]], [[Braunstone|Braunstone]]
*[[Reading/Wokingham_Urban_Area|Reading/Wokingham Urban Area]] - including [[Reading,_Berkshire|Reading]], [[Purley-on-Thames|Purley-on-Thames]], [[Wokingham|Wokingham]], [[Bracknell|Bracknell]]

There are also various places where whilst not actually running into each other, the amount of development in a large area is substantial.  Heavily built up areas of this type include :

*[[South_Hampshire|South Hampshire]], consisting of the Portsmouth and Southampton areas mentioned above, was considered for [[metropolitan_county|metropolitan county]] status in the [[1970s|1970s]]
*[[West_Yorkshire|West Yorkshire]] and [[South_Yorkshire|South Yorkshire]], which are both heavily built up but not entirely devoid of countryside (both are metropolitan counties)
*[[Cardiff|Cardiff]]/[[Newport|Newport]], consisting of the cities of [[Cardiff|Cardiff]] and [[Newport|Newport]], [[Cwmbran|Cwmbran]], much of the eastern South Wales Valleys with towns such as [[Risca|Risca]], [[Ebbw_Vale|Ebbw Vale]], [[Pontypool|Pontypool]] and [[Caerphilly|Caerphilly]] and part of the [[Vale_of_Glamorgan|Vale of Glamorgan]] including [[Penarth|Penarth]] and [[Barry,_Wales|Barry]].

The entire [[Merseyside|Merseyside]]/[[Warrington|Warrington]]/[[Greater_Manchester|Greater Manchester]] area (2821sq km) is not much bigger than West Yorkshire (2029sq km) but has a population topping 4 million in comparison to the 1.5 million of West Yorkshire.  There are gaps of countryside between towns on the way from Liverpool to Manchester, but not especially big ones.  The area between is protected as part of a Green Belt, to stop the conurbation proceeding further.

These examples are more likely to be referred to as [[Metropolitan_Area|Metropolitan Area]]s at the moment, however further expansion of suburban areas could lead to separate urban areas merging into one larger continuous urban area.

Smaller examples of conurbations also exist on a more local level.  For example, [[Harrogate|Harrogate]] runs into [[Knaresborough|Knaresborough]], [[Warwick|Warwick]] runs into [[Leamington_Spa|Leamington Spa]], [[Luton|Luton]] runs into [[Dunstable|Dunstable]], and [[Grimsby|Grimsby]] runs into [[Cleethorpes|Cleethorpes]]. -->
