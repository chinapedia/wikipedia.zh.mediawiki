'''坦克'''（Tank），又称'''肉盾'''（meat shield），是[[电子游戏|电子游戏]]的一种角色类型（詳見[[電子遊戲術語列表|電子遊戲術語列表]]）。在[[即时战略游戏|即时战略游戏]]、[[电子角色扮演游戏|角色扮演游戏]]、[[格斗游戏|格斗游戏]]和[[MUD|MUD]]中，坦克通过引离或吸引敌方攻击的方式，保护其他角色或单位。这类角色通常要顶住大量攻击，他们的[[生命值|生命值]]或防具通常很强，并由其他队员负责恢复<ref name="ywwr">{{cite book | last1 = Towers | first1 = J.

Well, yeah, some MUDs do have that kind of tank in them, but that's not what we're referring to. A ''tank'' in a typical fantasy MUD is the character who, alone or in a group, is always the first to attack a monster. A mob will direct its attacks at the first person that hits it, so in a group the tank is generally some character with enough hit points to withstand this punishment. Meanwhile the others hack safely away at the adversary — at least until the tank is killed and somebody else becomes the lucky target. Some MUDs now have monsters that can switch their attacks to other characters in the group, so the tank approach doesn't work as well with them. If you're a newbie and are asked to join a group, it's important that you understand this concept. Listen to the leader and only attack after she says, or you may end up tanking something that will toast your hide in seconds.}}</ref>。
