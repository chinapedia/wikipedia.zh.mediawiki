〈'''水火不容的愛'''〉（{{lang-en|''Hot to the Touch''}}）是《[[探險活寶|探險活寶]]》[[探險活寶_(第四季)|第四季]]的第1集。在[[卡通頻道|卡通頻道]]2012年4月2日播出。本集以[[阿寶·馬頓斯|阿寶]]和[[酷狗老皮|老皮]]為主角。在這一集裡，阿寶對火焰公主一見傾心，並想了解她，由於她的破壞性和無法控制的力量。

<!--==劇情==
Finn pursues Flame Princess (voiced by [[Jessica_DiCicco|Jessica DiCicco]]), trying to explain to her that he does not want to hurt her. However, Flame Princess, confused by Finn's aversion to fire, assumes that he merely wants to taunt her. She ventures to the Goblin Kingdom, intent on turning it into her new domain. Finn and Jake, meanwhile, return to the tree fort and, with the help of N.E.P.T.R. (voiced by [[Andy_Milonakis|Andy Milonakis]]), build [[flame-retardant|flame-retardant]] battle robots.

The two heroes descend on the Goblin Kingdom, and begin putting out the fire; this, in turn, hurts Flame Princess, both emotionally and physically, judging from her shedding of a single tear. Finn, horrified at the pain he has caused the object of his affections, exits his robot and calls for Flame Princess's attention, before his emotions cause him to cry. The tears alert Flame Princess that Finn is a "water elemental", and that the two will only hurt each other, due to the opposition of their natural states.

==Production==
"Hot to the Touch" was written and storyboarded by [[Cole_Sanchez|Cole Sanchez]] and [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]], from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Hot to the Touch| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Cole Sanchez & Rebecca Sugar (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=April 2, 2012| season = 4 | number = 1}}</ref> This was the first episode that Sugar and Sanchez worked on together; Sugar's previous partner [[Adam_Muto|Adam Muto]] served as the episode's creative director, and also helped clean up the episode's storyboards.<ref name=episodecredits/><ref name=sanchez>Sanchez, Cole (Storyboard artist). 2014. "Hot to the Touch" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> Sugar was excited to get a chance to show how Flame Princess interacted in the Land of Ooo, because in "Incendium", she was only shown inside of her lantern.<ref name=sugar>Sugar, Rebecca (Storyboard artist). 2014. "Hot to the Touch" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> The line about Finn wanting to play BMO with Flame Princess was based on Sanchez's with his high school girlfriend; he reasoned that, since Finn was younger, his ultimate idea of love would be to sit next to his love interest and play video games.<ref name=sanchez/>

The episode features Andy Milonakis reprising his role as N.E.P.T.R., a character that was last seen in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_1)|first season]] episode "What is Life?"<ref name=episodecredits/><ref>{{cite web|last1=McLean|first1=Thomas|title='Adventure Time' Season 4 Premieres April 2|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/adventure-time-season-4-premieres-april-2/|work=[[Animation_Magazine|Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=October 7, 2014|date=March 12, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode| title=What is Life?| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Luther McLaurin and Armen Mirzaian (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=June 14, 2010| season = 1 | number = 15}}</ref> The short rap "Working for the Master" that is sung by N.E.P.T.R. was written by Sugar. She had originally planned for her demo version to merely be a filler track, as she expected Milonakis to want to write his own rap. To her surprise, however, Milonakis enjoyed her version and wanted to perform it the way it was written. Sugar's father, Rob, later released her demo version on his [[YouTube|YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sugar|first1=Rob|title=Adventure Time Rap from Hot to the Touch|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apx8rhdsrEM|publisher=[[YouTube|YouTube]]|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=April 3, 2012}}</ref> Series composer Tim Kiefer produced the song's instrumental. Inspired by [[Wu-Tang_Clan|Wu-Tang Clan]]'s penchant for sampling, Kieffer took his music from the [[Adventure_Time_(season_1)|season one]] episode "What is Life?" and edited it substantially, creating the "clattery bumpin' beat" featured in the episode.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kiefer|first1=Tim|url=http://pwcartoons.frederator.com/post/20784428008/neptr-rap-wwwtcd-adventure-time-composer-tim|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=September 1, 2014|archiveurl=http://nastysonix.com/post/20785577110/adventuretime-neptr-rap-wwwtcd-adventure|title=NEPTR Rap.

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' gave the episode a largely positive review, noting that "in the episode’s 10 minutes, the writers create an apt metaphor for pubescent dating, as Finn and FP struggle to make a relationship work."<ref name=avclubhot/> He noted the symbolism inherent in making Flame Princess a fire elemental, writing that "fire is the perfect element for a hormonal teenage princess, and FP can’t control her emotions, burning everything in her path as she reacts to Finn’s advances."<ref name=avclubhot/> Sava also complimented the return of N.E.P.T.R., as well as his short rap, which Sava called "a perfect little musical interlude at the midway point of the episode."<ref name=avclubhot>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Adventure Time – 'Hot To The Touch'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/iadventure-timei-hot-to-the-touch-71761|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

Mike Lechevaillier of ''[[Slate_(magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, in a review of the fourth season, wrote that "it's frequently astonishing to observe the confidence and wide-ranging appeal with which Adventure Time unswervingly depicts the many stages of infatuation."<ref name=season4slate/> The reviewer highlighted "Hot to the Touch" as an example of such an example, noting that Flame Princess represents "an uncomplicated yet vastly pertinent metaphor for the hypothesis that the closer you cherish someone, the likelier they are to singe your soft exterior and the easier it is for them to affectionately melt your exposed heart."<ref name=season4slate>{{cite web|last=LeChevallier|first=Mike|title=Adventure Time: Season Four|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/adventure-time-season-four/328|work=[[Slate_(magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The_Washington_Post_Company|The Washington Post Company]]|accessdate=January 26, 2013|date=May 13, 2012}}</ref> Marc Snetiker of ''[[Entertainment_Weekly|Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded the episode a "B", noting that "the season four premiere of this inspired 'toon about a boy and his precocious dog is as colorful, clever, and unpredictably funny as ever."<ref name="Snetiker 2012">{{Cite journal|last1=Snetiker|first1=Marc|date=April 6, 2012|url=|title=What to Watch|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Inc.|issue=1201|page=66|via=EbscoHost Connection}}</ref>
