'''成瘾'''（{{lang-en|addiction}}）是指一種重複性的[[強迫行為|強迫行為]]，即使這些行為已知可能造成不良後果的情形下，仍然被持續重複<ref name="pmid18790142">{{cite journal | author = Angres DH, Bettinardi-Angres K | title = The disease of addiction: origins, treatment, and recovery | journal = Dis Mon | volume = 54 | issue = 10 | pages = 696–721 | pmid = 18790142 | doi = 10.1016/j.disamonth.2008.07.002 | url = |date=October 2008}}</ref>。這種行為可能因中樞神經系統功能失調造成，重複這些行為也可以反過來造成神經功能受損<ref>{{cite journal | author = American Society for Addiction Medicine | title = Definition of Addiction | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2012 | month = | url = http://www.asam.org/for-the-public/definition-of-addiction}}</ref>。'''瘾'''可用于描述生理依賴或者过度的心理依赖，例如[[物質依賴|物質依賴]]，[[药物滥用|药物滥用]]（即俗称的[[滥药|滥药]]、[[毒品|毒]]瘾）、[[酗酒|酒瘾]]、[[香烟|烟]]瘾、[[強迫性性行為|性癮]]。或是持續出現特定行為（赌、暴食），[[网络成瘾症|网瘾]]、[[问题赌博|赌瘾]]、[[官|官]]瘾、财迷、[[工作狂|工作狂]]、[[暴食症|暴食症]]、[[色情狂|色情狂]]、[[跟蹤狂|跟蹤狂]]、[[偷窃狂|偷窃狂]]、[[整形|整形]]迷恋及[[购物狂|购物狂]]等，是[[生理|生理]]或者[[心理|心理]]上，甚至是同時具备的一种依赖症。

瘾有分為物質成癮及{{le|行為成癮|Behavioral addiction}}，行為成癮是和物质无关的强迫症，如赌瘾和网瘾。在这几种通常的用法中，瘾是描述一种某人高频率反复从事可能对其身心健康和社交生活有害的活动的一种[[强迫症|强迫行为]]。而[[精神疾病診斷與統計手冊|精神疾病診斷與統計手冊]]的第五版{{le|DSM-5|DSM-5}}中有將[[问题赌博|赌瘾]]（gambling disorder）列入<ref>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753073/ Clinical and Research Implications of Gambling Disorder in DSM-5]</ref>。有時成瘾（addiction）會和[[物質依賴|物質依賴]]（substance dependence）混淆<ref name="Addiction-dependence distinction">{{cite web | author = American Psychiatric Association | title = Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders | url = http://www.dsm5.org/documents/substance%20use%20disorder%20fact%20sheet.pdf | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | accessdate = 10 July 2015 | pages = 1–2 | date = 2013 | quote = Additionally, the diagnosis of dependence caused much confusion. Most people link dependence with "addiction" when in fact dependence can be a normal body response to a substance. }}</ref>。兩者主要的不同是：物質依賴者在中斷物質使用後，會出現[[藥物戒斷|戒斷]]症狀，甚至造成更多的使用該物質，而成瘾是強制性的攝取某種物質或從事特定行為，不一定有戒斷症狀。

物質成瘾會對個人和社會帶來顯著的影響，包括成癮物質帶來的直接影響、伴隨的醫療費用、長期的併發症（例如吸煙可能造成的[[肺癌|肺癌]]、酒癮可能會有的[[肝硬化|肝硬化]]、靜脈注射甲基苯丙胺會出現的{{le|冰毒嘴|meth mouth}}症狀）、[[神经可塑性|神经可塑性]]（因為經驗原因引起大腦結構的改變）帶來的影響、以及後續生產力的下降<ref name="Societal toll">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = 4 | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 1: Basic Principles of Neuropharmacology | quote = Drug abuse and addiction exact an astoundingly high financial and human toll on society through direct adverse effects, such as lung cancer and hepatic cirrhosis, and indirect adverse effects—for example, accidents and AIDS—on health and productivity.}}</ref><ref name="Epidem">{{cite journal|authors = KR Merikangas KR, McClair VL | title = Epidemiology of Substance Use Disorders | date = June 2012 | journal = Hum.

有时在口语上，瘾也用于指某些人的一些癖好，例如读书、收集（集邮）、看电视、玩游戏、购物、工作、上网、运动及进食等。不過在本条目中，瘾主要是被用于[[滥药|滥用药物]]和物质滥用问题，也就是有生理依賴或者过度心理依赖的行為。

== 醫學觀點==
医学上，成癮是腦中[[獎勵系統|獎勵系統]]在基因[[转录|转录]]及[[表觀遺傳學|表觀遺傳]]機制上出現的失調，成癮有許多心理上的原因，但依生理來說，是在長期暴露在高度的成癮刺激原（addictive stimulus，例如嗎啡、可卡因、性交、賭博等）後出現的情形<ref name="Cellular basis"/><ref name="What the ΔFosB?">{{cite journal | author = Ruffle JK | title = Molecular neurobiology of addiction: what's all the (Δ)FosB about? | journal = Am.

Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75).

Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA ... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009). ... In some people, there is a transition from "normal" to compulsive engagement in natural rewards (such as food or sex), a condition that some have termed behavioral or non-drug addictions (Holden, 2001; Grant et al., 2006a). ... In humans, the role of dopamine signaling in incentive-sensitization processes has recently been highlighted by the observation of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs. This syndrome is characterized by a medication-induced increase in (or compulsive) engagement in non-drug rewards such as gambling, shopping, or sex (Evans et al, 2006; Aiken, 2007; Lader, 2008)."}}<br /><!--The following link is outside the template to make it hyperlinked while appearing to be part of the quote.-->[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139704/table/T1/ Table 1: Summary of plasticity observed following exposure to drug or natural reinforcers]"</ref>。重複暴露在成癮刺激原是主要導致成癮以及維持成癮現象的主要病理因素<ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref>{{cite web | author = American Society for Addiction Medicine | title = Definition of Addiction | journal = | volume = | issue = | pages = | year = 2012 | url = http://www.asam.org/for-the-public/definition-of-addiction}}</ref>。成癮刺激原有二個特性，一個是其[[增強|正向增強]]（接觸後會增加再去進行類似行為的可能性），另一個是[[獎勵系統|內在獎勵]]（認為此物質或是行為有趣、會想要再去進行）<ref name="Cellular basis" /><ref name="Nestler Labs Glossary"/><ref name="Reward system and psychostimulants">{{cite journal | authors = Taylor SB, Lewis CR, Olive MF | title = The neurocircuitry of illicit psychostimulant addiction: acute and chronic effects in humans | journal = Subst.
