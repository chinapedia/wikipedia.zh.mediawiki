'''成見威脅'''（{{lang-en|'''stereotype threat'''}}）是指一個人在某種環境裡，會擔憂或焦慮自己的行為，將會驗證那些對於自己所屬[[社會群體|社會群體]]的負面[[刻板印象|刻板印象]]，而這種焦慮將會影響該人的表現，使得他的表現變差。成见威胁於1995年被引進至[[學術|學術]]界上，從此成為[[社會心理學|社會心理學]]範疇上經常被目。

In the early 1990s, Claude Steele, in collaboration with Joshua Aronson, performed the first experiments demonstrating that stereotype threat can undermine intellectual performance.<ref name="SteeleAronson">{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Claude M.|last2=Aronson|first2=Joshua|title=Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-personality-and-social-psychology_1995-11_69_5/page/797|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=69|issue=5|year=1995|pages=797–811|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.5.797|pmid=7473032}}</ref> They had [[African_american#Education|African-American]] and European-American college students take a difficult verbal portion of the [[Graduate_Record_Examination|Graduate Record Examination]] test. As would be expected based on national averages, the African-American students performed less well on the test. Steele and Aronson split students into three groups; stereotype-threat (in which the test was described as being "diagnostic of intellectual ability"), non-stereotype threat (in which the test was described as "a laboratory problem-solving task that was nondiagnostic of ability"), and a third condition (in which the test was again described as nondiagnostic of ability, but participants were asked to view the difficult test as a challenge). All three groups received the same test.

Adjusted for previous SAT scores, subjects in the non-diagnostic-challenge condition performed significantly better than those in the non-diagnostic-only condition, and the diagnostic conditions. In the first experiment, the race-by-condition interaction was not significant, meaning that African-Americans were not more significantly affected by being placed in a diagnostic condition than were European-Americans, contrary to the predictions of stereotype threat theory. The second study reported in the same paper did, however, find a significant effect.<ref name="SteeleAronson" />

Steele and Aronson concluded that changing the instructions on the test can reduce African-American students' concern about confirming a negative stereotype about their group. Supporting this conclusion, they found that African-American students who regarded the test as a measure of intelligence had more thoughts related to negative stereotypes of their group. Steele and Aronson measured this through a word completion task. They found that African-Americans who thought the test measured intelligence were more likely to complete word fragments using words that are associated with relevant negative stereotypes (e.g., completing __mb as "[[wikt:dumb|dumb]]" rather than "[[wikt:numb|numb]]").<ref name="SteeleAronson" />

有超過三百篇已出版的研究，都在多個領域裡發現了成見威脅對表現的影響。<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arizona.edu/sites/arizona.edu/files/users/user14/Stereotype%20Threat%20Overview.pdf |title=Stereotype Threat: An Overview |last1=Stroessner |first1=Steve |last2=Good |first2=Catherine |date= |work=dingo.sbs.arizona.edu |publisher=Reducing Stereotype Threat.org |accessdate=6 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604102601/http://www.arizona.edu/sites/arizona.edu/files/users/user14/Stereotype%20Threat%20Overview.pdf |archive-date=2012-06-04 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>成見威脅是否會出現和任務是被貼上何種[[標籤效應|標籤]]有關。如果任務被貼上中性的標籤，那成見威脅就較不會出現；然而若測驗附有與既有成見相合的內容的話，那參與者就有可能會有較差的表現。像例如對[[西洋棋|西洋棋]]下棋者的研究顯示，若女性參與這被告知說對手是男性的話，她們的表現就會比預期的來得差；相反地，若女性參與這被告知對手是女性的話，其表現就會和依過去紀錄所預期的一致。<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Maass|first1=Anne|last2=D'Ettole|first2=Claudio|last3=Cadinu|first3=Mara|title=Checkmate?

The mere presence of other people can evoke stereotype threat. In one experiment, women who took a mathematics exam along with two other women got 70% of the answers right; while those doing the same exam in the presence of two men got an average score of 55%.<ref name="InzlichtBen-Zeev2000">{{cite journal|last1=Inzlicht|first1=M.|last2=Ben-Zeev|first2=T.|title=A Threatening Intellectual Environment: Why Females Are Susceptible to Experiencing Problem-Solving Deficits in the Presence of Males|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_psychological-science_2000-09_11_5/page/365|journal=Psychological Science|volume=11|issue=5|year=2000|pages=365–371|issn=0956-7976|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00272}}</ref> Researchers [http://www2.binghamton.edu/som/faculty/gupta.html Vishal Gupta], [http://business.missouri.edu/28/243.aspx Daniel Turban], and [http://www.nachiketbhawe.com/ Nachiket Bhawe] extended stereotype threat research to [[entrepreneurship|entrepreneurship]], a traditionally male-stereotyped profession.

Overall, findings suggest that stereotype threat is likely to occur in any situation where an individual faces the potential of confirming a negative stereotype. For example, stereotype threat can negatively affect the performance of [[European_Americans|European Americans]] in athletic situations<ref name="White Men Can't Jump">{{cite journal|last1=Stone|first1=Jeff|last2=Perry|first2=W.|last3=Darley|first3=John|title="White Men Can't Jump": Evidence for the Perceptual Confirmation of Racial Stereotypes Following a Basketball Game|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_basic-and-applied-social-psychology_1997-09_19_3/page/291|journal=Basic and Applied Social Psychology|volume=19|issue=3|year=1997|pages=291–306|issn=0197-3533|doi=10.1207/s15324834basp1903_2}}</ref> as well as men who are being tested on their social sensitivity.<ref name="Stereotype Threat in Men">{{cite journal|last1=Koenig|first1=Anne M.|last2=Eagly|first2=Alice H.|title=Stereotype Threat in Men on a Test of Social Sensitivity|journal=Sex Roles|volume=52|issue=7–8|year=2005|pages=489–496|issn=0360-0025|doi=10.1007/s11199-005-3714-x}}</ref> Although the framing of a task can produce stereotype threat in most individuals, certain individuals appear to be more likely to experience stereotype threat than others. Individuals who are highly identified with a particular group appear to be more vulnerable to experiencing stereotype threat than individuals who do not identify strongly with the stereotyped group.

The goal of the study by Desert, Preaux, and Jund was to see if children from lower socioeconomic groups are affected by stereotype threat. The study that was conducted took children that were 6–7 years old and children that were 8–9 years old from multiple elementary schools, and presented them with Raven’s matrix test (which is an intellectual ability test and then answering a short questionnaire). Separate groups of children were given directions in an evaluative way and other groups were given directions in a non-evaluative way. The "evaluative" group received instructions that are usually given with the Raven matrices test and the "non-evaluative" group was given directions which made it seem as if the children were simply playing a game. The results showed that third graders performed better on the test than the first graders did, which was expected. However, the lower socioeconomic status children did worse on the test when they received directions in an evaluative way than the higher socioeconomic status children did when they received directions in an evaluative way. These results also reflected the hypothesis of the study, which suggested that the framing of the directions given to the children may have a greater effect on their performance than their socioeconomic status does. This was shown by the differences in performance based on which type of instructions they received. This information can be useful in classroom settings to help improve the performance of students of lower socioeconomic status.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Desert|first=Michael|coauthors=Marie Preaux, Robin Jund|title=So young and already victims of stereotype threat: Socio-economic status and performance of 6 to 9 years old children on Raven's progressive matrices.|journal=European Journal of Psychology of Education|year=2009|volume=24|issue=2|pages=207–218|doi=10.1007/BF03173012}}</ref>

There have been studies on senior citizens and the effects of stereotype threat based on aging. A study was done on 99 senior citizens ranging in age from 60–75 years. These seniors were given multiple tests on certain factors and categories that they find important such as memory and physical abilities. They were also asked to evaluate how physically fit they believe themselves to be. They were also asked to read articles which contained both positive and negative outlooks about seniors. In addition they watched someone reading the same articles. The goal of this study was to see if priming the participants before the tests would affect performance. The results showed that the control group performed better than those that were primed with either negative or positive words prior to the tests. The control group seemed to feel more confident in their abilities than the other two groups. However, these results could have been affected by the sample of seniors that were used. The participants were all well educated, healthy, and living at a place which was welcoming to seniors. This particular group of seniors may be the ones that could remain resistant to negative stereotype threats towards those who are aging.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Horton|first=Sean|coauthors=Joseph Baker, William Pearce, Janice Deakin|title=Immunity to Popular Stereotypes of Aging?

===Stereotype lift and stereotype boost===
Stereotype threat concerns how stereotypes harm performance; however stereotype activation can also lead to performance enhancement in certain situations. An increase in performance can arise due to stereotype lift which occurs when people are exposed to negative stereotypes about another group.<ref name="Walton 2003 456–467">{{cite journal|last=Walton|first=G. M.|coauthors=Cohen, G. L.|title=Stereotype lift|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=39|issue=5|pages=456–467|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(03)00019-2}}</ref> This enhanced performance has been attributed to increases in [[self-efficacy|self-efficacy]] and decreases in self-doubt as a result of negative [[Ingroups_and_outgroups|outgroup]] stereotypes.<ref name="Walton 2003 456–467"/> Another situation which can lead to performance enhancement is when stereotype boost occurs. Stereotype boost theorists posit that positive stereotypes may actually enhance performance.<ref name="Shih, M. J. 2012 141–156">{{cite book|title=Stereotype Threat: Theory, Process, and Application|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0199732442|pages=141–156|author=Shih, M. J.|coauthors=Pittinsky, T.L.; Ho, G. C.|editor=Inzlicht, M.; Schmader, T.|chapter=Stereotype boost: Positive outcomes from the activation of positive stereotypes}}</ref> Stereotype boost occurs when a positive aspect of an individual's social identity is made salient in an identity relevant domain. Consistent with the positive racial stereotype concerning their superior quantitative skills, [[Asian_American|Asian American]] women performed better on a math test when their Asian identity was [[Priming_(psychology)|primed]] compared to a [[Treatment_and_control_groups|control condition]] where no social identity was primed. Conversely, participants did worse on the math test when their gender identity was made salient which is consistent with stereotype threat.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shih|first=M|coauthors=Pittinsky, T.L.; Trahan, A.|title=Domain-specific effects of stereotypes on performance|journal=Self and Identity|year=2006|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1080/15298860500338534|url=https://research.hks.harvard.edu/publications/getFile.aspx?Id=171}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Steen|first=L.
