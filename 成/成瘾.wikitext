瘾有分為物質成癮及{{le|行為成癮|Behavioral addiction}}，行為成癮是和物质无关的强迫症，如赌瘾和网瘾。在这几种通常的用法中，瘾是描述一种某人高频率反复从事可能对其身心健康和社交生活有害的活动的一种[[强迫症|强迫行为]]。而[[精神疾病診斷與統計手冊|精神疾病診斷與統計手冊]]的第五版[[DSM-5|DSM-5]]中有將[[问题赌博|赌瘾]]（gambling disorder）列入<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753073/ |title=Clinical and Research Implications of Gambling Disorder in DSM-5 |access-date=2017-05-04 |archive-date=2021-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210809043005/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4753073/ |dead-url=no }}</ref>。有時成瘾（addiction）會和[[物質依賴|物質依賴]]（substance dependence）混淆<ref name="Addiction-dependence distinction">{{cite web | author = American Psychiatric Association | title = Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders | url = http://www.dsm5.org/documents/substance%20use%20disorder%20fact%20sheet.pdf | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | accessdate = 10 July 2015 | pages = 1–2 | date = 2013 | quote = Additionally, the diagnosis of dependence caused much confusion. Most people link dependence with "addiction" when in fact dependence can be a normal body response to a substance. | archive-date = 2015-08-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150815050402/http://www.dsm5.org/Documents/Substance%20Use%20Disorder%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf | dead-url = no }}</ref>。兩者主要的不同是：物質依賴者在中斷物質使用後，會出現[[藥物戒斷|戒斷]]症狀，甚至造成更多的使用該物質，而成瘾是強制性的攝取某種物質或從事特定行為，不一定有戒斷症狀。

物質成瘾會對個人和社會帶來顯著的影響，包括成癮物質帶來的直接影響、伴隨的醫療費用、長期的併發症（例如吸煙可能造成的[[肺癌|肺癌]]、酒癮可能會有的[[肝硬化|肝硬化]]、靜脈注射甲基苯丙胺會出現的{{le|冰毒嘴|meth mouth}}症狀）、[[神经可塑性|神经可塑性]]（因為經驗原因引起大腦結構的改變）帶來的影響、以及後續生產力的下降<ref name="Societal toll">{{cite book |vauthors=Malenka RC, Nestler EJ, Hyman SE |veditors=Sydor A, Brown RY | title = Molecular Neuropharmacology: A Foundation for Clinical Neuroscience |url=https://archive.org/details/molecularneuroph00nest | year = 2009 | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical | location = New York | isbn = 9780071481274 | page = [https://archive.org/details/molecularneuroph00nest/page/n4 4] | edition = 2nd | chapter = Chapter 1: Basic Principles of Neuropharmacology | quote = Drug abuse and addiction exact an astoundingly high financial and human toll on society through direct adverse effects, such as lung cancer and hepatic cirrhosis, and indirect adverse effects—for example, accidents and AIDS—on health and productivity.}}</ref><ref name="Epidem">{{cite journal|authors = KR Merikangas KR, McClair VL | title = Epidemiology of Substance Use Disorders | date = June 2012 | journal = Hum.

有时在口语上，瘾也用于指某些人的一些癖好，例如读书、收集（集邮）、看电视、[[游戏成瘾|玩游戏]]、购物、工作、上网、运动及进食等。不過在本条目中，瘾主要是被用于[[滥药|滥用药物]]和物质滥用问题，也就是有生理依賴或者过度心理依赖的行為。

Cross-sensitization is also bidirectional, as a history of amphetamine administration facilitates sexual behavior and enhances the associated increase in NAc DA ... As described for food reward, sexual experience can also lead to activation of plasticity-related signaling cascades. The transcription factor delta FosB is increased in the NAc, PFC, dorsal striatum, and VTA following repeated sexual behavior (Wallace et al., 2008; Pitchers et al., 2010b). This natural increase in delta FosB or viral overexpression of delta FosB within the NAc modulates sexual performance, and NAc blockade of delta FosB attenuates this behavior (Hedges et al, 2009; Pitchers et al., 2010b). Further, viral overexpression of delta FosB enhances the conditioned place preference for an environment paired with sexual experience (Hedges et al., 2009). ... In some people, there is a transition from "normal" to compulsive engagement in natural rewards (such as food or sex), a condition that some have termed behavioral or non-drug addictions (Holden, 2001; Grant et al., 2006a). ... In humans, the role of dopamine signaling in incentive-sensitization processes has recently been highlighted by the observation of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome in some patients taking dopaminergic drugs.
