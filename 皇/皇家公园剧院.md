==历史==
<!--
Built in 1782 to plans by the architect [[Louis_Montoyer|Louis Montoyer]], the Théâtre du Parc was at first an annexe to the [[La_Monnaie|Théâtre de la Monnaie]] : the brothers [[Alexandre_Bultos|Alexandre]] and [[Herman_Bultos|Herman Bultos]] exploited the two theatres at the same time, with the ''Parc'' used for plays featuring young actors, as a sort of drama school for La Monnaie.  It was closed in 1807 by [[Napoleon|Napoleon]]'s [[decree_on_the_theatres|decree on the theatres]], but re-opened in 1814 and was occupied by a British company for a year then a Dutch company for a few months.

From 1819, the City of Brussels, owner of these two "Royal Theatres", granted a concession to one director after another.  The company and repertoire were identical yet distinct, with the Théâtre du Parc specialising in [[vaudeville|vaudeville]] and [[théâtre_de_boulevard|théâtre de boulevard]].

From 1850 to 1854, the ''Parc'' hosted Dutch productions, then specialised in operetta and [[opéra-comique|opéra-comique]], and finally (from  1869) in comedies.  During the First World War both theatres were requisitioned and the Parc became a playhouse for the German garrison.  Returning to Francophone theatre in 1919, it put on classic pieces featuring Belgian actors.  Its present director is  Yves Larec.
