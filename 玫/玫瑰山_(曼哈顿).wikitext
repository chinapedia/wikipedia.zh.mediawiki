'''玫瑰山'''（{{lang-en|Rose Hill}}）是美国[[纽约市|纽约市]][[曼哈顿|曼哈顿]]的一片最近恢复名称的街区<ref>{{cite news |title=NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: ROSE HILL; It's the Final Furlong For a Loved OTB Parlor |first=Karen Tina |last=Harrison |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE7D7153FF932A35757C0A9679C8B63 |newspaper=[[The_New_York_Times|The New York Times]] |date=April 1, 2001 |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}</ref>。它南到25街，北到30街，东到[[第三大道|第三大道]]，西到[[麦迪逊大道|麦迪逊大道]]或[[第五大道|第五大道]]。毗邻的街区，北面是茉莉山（Murray Hill），东面是基普湾（Kips Bay），南面是[[熨斗区|熨斗区]]和[[葛莱美西公园|葛莱美西公园]]，西面是诺麦狄（NoMad）<ref>Neighborhoods in New York City do not have official status, and their boundaries are not specifically set by the city.  (There are a number of [[Community_Boards_of_Manhattan|Community Boards]], whose boundaries are officially set, but these are fairly large and generally contain a number of neighborhoods,  and the [http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neighbor/neigh.shtml neighborhood map] {{Wayback|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/neighbor/neigh.shtml |date=20120915134408 }} issued by the Department of City Planning only shows the largest ones.)  Because of this, the definition of where neighborhoods begin and end is subject to a variety of forces, including the efforts of real estate concerns to promote certain areas, the use of neighborhood names in media news reports, and the everyday usage of people.  The eastern boundary of [[NoMad|NoMad]], an up-and-coming neighborhood north and west of Madison Square Park, and the western boundary of Rose Hill, is thus uncertain, and proponents of both may make claim to the assets that lie in the borderlands between them.</ref>。
