'''孟买管辖区'''（{{lang-en|Bombay Presidency}}、{{lang-mr|मुंबई इलाखा}}、{{lang-gu|મુંબઇ પ્રાંત}}、{{lang-kn|ಬಾಂಬೆ ಪ್ರಾಂತ}}、{{lang-sd|بومبي صدارت}}）是过去[[英属印度|英属印度]]的一个省份，它成立于17世纪，起初作为[[英国东印度公司|英国东印度公司]]的贸易据点，后来发展到包括印度西部和中部的大部分，以及一部分巴基斯坦和阿拉伯半岛。在它范围最大的时候，孟买管辖区包括今天印度的 [[古吉拉特邦|古吉拉特邦]]、[[马哈拉施特拉邦|马哈拉施特拉邦]]西部的三分之二，<!-- 包括[[Konkan|Konkan]], [[Desh|Desh]], and [[Kandesh|Kandesh]]地区, -->和[[卡纳塔克邦|卡纳塔克邦]]西北部；还包括今天 [[巴基斯坦|巴基斯坦]]的[[信德省|信德省]]以及[[也门|也门]][[亚丁|亚丁]]的英国领地。孟买管辖区的一部分直接由英国人统治，还有一部分是由臣服英国总督的当地王公统治的[[土邦|土邦]]。

==早期历史==
[[英国|英国]]在孟买管辖区的第一个居留地建于1618年，当时东印度公司在[[苏拉特|苏拉特]]建立了一个商行，并获得了[[莫卧儿帝国|莫卧儿帝国]]皇帝[[贾汉吉尔|贾汉吉尔]]的保护。1626年，[[荷兰|荷兰]]和英国做出了一次成功的努力，从[[葡萄牙|葡萄牙]]手中获取了<!--  possession of [[孟买|孟买]]岛 in 沿海的[[Konkan|Konkan]]地区, and in [[1653|1653]] proposals were suggested for its purchase from the Portuguese. 1661年 it was ceded to the British crown, as part of the dowry of the infanta [[Catherine_of_Braganza|Catherine of Braganza]] on her marriage with [[Charles_II_of_England|Charles II of England]]. So lightly was the acquisition esteemed in England, and so unsuccessful was the administration of the crown officers, that 在[[1668|1668]] 孟买被转让给东印度公司，每年的租金为10英镑。在移交的时候，powers for its defence and for the administration of justice were also conferred; a European regiment was enrolled; and the fortifications erected proved 足够 to deter 荷兰人 from their intended attack in [[1673|1673]]。[[1687|1687]] 孟买was placed at the head of all 公司's possessions in India；但在1753年 孟买政府 became subordinate to that of [[加尔各答|加尔各答]]. -->

==领地扩张==
<!-- 在18世纪，[[印度教|印度教]]的[[马拉地帝国|马拉地帝国]]迅速扩张，征服了Konkan and much of [[古吉拉特|古吉拉特]]东部 从分裂的莫卧儿帝国。在古吉拉特西部，包括[[Kathiawar|Kathiawar]] and [[Cutch|Cutch]], the loosening of 莫卧儿帝国控制的 allowed 众多当地 rulers to create 事实上独立的 states. The first conflict between the British and the Marathas was the [[First_Anglo-Maratha_War|First Anglo-Maratha War]] which began in [[1774|1774]] and resulted in the [[1782|1782]] treaty of Salbai, by which [[Salsette|Salsette]] was ceded to the British, while [[Bharuch|Bharuch]] was ceded to the Maratha ruler [[Scindia|Scindia]]. The British annexed Surat in [[1800|1800]]. British territory was enlarged in the [[Second_Anglo-Maratha_War|Second Anglo-Maratha War]] which ended in [[1803|1803]]. The East India Company received the districts of [[Bharuch|Bharuch]], [[Kaira|Kaira]], etc., and the Maratha [[Gaekwad|Gaekwad]] rulers of [[Vadodara|Baroda]] acknowledged British sovereignty. -->

在1803年，孟买管辖区只包括[[撒尔塞特岛|撒尔塞特岛]]（自1774年起）、苏拉特和<!-- [[Bankot|Bankot]] (since [[1756|1756]]);  but between this date and [[1827|1827]] the framework of the presidency took shape. The Gujarat districts were taken over by the Bombay government in [[1805|1805]] and enlarged in [[1818|1818]]; The numerous small states of [[Kathiawar|Kathiawar]] and [[Mahikantha|Mahikantha]] were organized into [[princely_state|princely state]]s under British suzerainty between [[1807|1807]] and [[1820|1820]]. [[Baji_Rao_II|Baji Rao II]], the last of the [[peshwa|peshwa]]s, who had attempted to shake off the British yoke, was defeated in the [[Battle_of_Khadki|Battle of Khadki]], captured subsequently and pensioned (1817 1818), and large portions of his dominions ([[Pune|Pune]], [[Ahmednagar|Ahmednagar]], [[Nasik|Nasik]], [[Sholapur|Sholapur]], [[Belgaum|Belgaum]], [[Kaladgi|Kaladgi]], [[Dharwad|Dharwad]], etc.) were included in the presidency, the settlement of which was completed by [[Mountstuart_Elphinstone|Mountstuart Elphinstone]], governor from 1819 to 1827. His policy was to rule as far as possible on native lines, avoiding all changes for which the population was not yet ripe; but the grosser abuses of the old regime were stopped, the country was pacified, the laws were codified, and courts and schools were established. The period that followed is notable mainly for the enlargement of the presidency through the lapse of certain native states, by the addition of [[Aden|Aden]] ([[1839|1839]]) and [[Sind|Sind]] (1843), and the lease of [[Panch_Mahal|Panch Mahal]]s from Sindhia (1853). The establishment of an orderly administration, one outcome of which was a general fall of prices that made the unwonted regularity of the collection of taxes doubly unwelcome, naturally excited a certain amount of misgiving and resentment; but on the whole the population was prosperous and contented, and under Lord Elphinstone (1853-1860) the presidency passed through the crisis of the [[Revolt_of_1857|Revolt of 1857]] without any general rising. Outbreaks among the troops at [[Karachi|Karachi]], [[Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad]] and [[Kolhapur|Kolhapur]] were quickly put down, two regiments being disbanded, and the rebellions in Gujarat, among the [[Bhil|Bhil]]s, and in the southern Maratha country were local and isolated. Under Sir [[Bartle_Frere|Bartle Frere]] (1862-1867) agricultural prosperity reached its highest point, as a result of the [[American_Civil_War|American Civil War]] and the consequent enormous demand for 印度[[cotton|cotton]] in [[欧洲|欧洲]]. The money thus poured into the country produced an epidemic of speculation known as the [[Share_Mania|Share Mania]] (1864-1865), which ended in a commercial crisis and the failure of the bank of Bombay (1866). But the peasantry gained on the whole more than they lost, and the trade of Bombay was not permanently injured. Sir Bartle Frere encouraged the completion of the great trunk lines of [[Indian_Railways|railways]], and with the funds obtained by the demolition of the town walls ([[1862|1862]]) he began the magnificent series of public buildings that now adorn [[孟买|孟买]]。 -->

==行政==
<!-- 孟买管辖区was divided into four commissionerships and 26 districts ，首府设在孟买市。The four divisions were the northern or Gujarat,central or [[Deccan|Deccan]], the southern or [[Carnatic|Carnatic]], and Sind. The twenty-six districts were: [[Mumbai_City_District|Bombay City]], [[Ahmedabad_District|Ahmedabad]], [[Bharuch_District|Bharuch]], [[Kaira_District|Kaira]], [[Panch_Mahal|Panch Mahal]]s, [[Surat_District|Surat]], [[Thane_District|Thane]], [[Ahmednagar_District|Ahmednagar]], [[Khandesh|Khandesh]] (partitioned into two districts in 1906), [[Nashik_District|Nasik]], [[Pune_District|Poona]] (Pune), [[Satara_District|Satara]], [[Sholapur_District|Sholapur]], [[Belgaum_District|Belgaum]], [[Bijapur_District|Bijapur]], [[Dharwad_District|Dharwad]] (Dharwar), [[North_Kanara|North Kanara]], [[Kolaba_District|Kolaba]], [[Ratnagiri_District|Ratnagiri]], [[Karachi|Karachi]], [[Hyderabad,_Pakistan|Hyderabad]], [[Shikarpur|Shikarpur]], [[Thar_and_Parkar|Thar and Parkar]], and [[Upper_Sind_Frontier|Upper Sind Frontier]]. -->

<!-- The native states comprise in all 353 separate units, which are administered either by political agents or by the collectors of the districts in which the smaller states are situated. The chief groups of states are North Gujarat, comprising [[Cutch|Cutch]], [[Kathiawar_Agency|Kathiawar Agency]], [[Palanpur_Agency|Palanpur Agency]], [[Mahi_Kantha_Agency|Mahi Kantha Agency]], [[Rewa_Kantha_Agency|Rewa Kantha Agency]] and [[Cambay|Cambay]]; South Gujarat, comprising [[Dharampur|Dharampur]], [[Bansda|Bansda]] and [[Sachin_(princely_state)|Sachin]]; North Konkan, Nasik and Khandesh, comprising Khandesh political agency, [[Surgana|Surgana]] and [[Jawhar|Jawhar]]; South Konkan and Dharwar, comprising [[Janjira|Janjira]], [[Sawantwadi|Sawantwadi]] and [[Savanur|Savanur]]; the Deccan Satara Jagirs, comprising [[Akkalkot|Akkalkot]], [[Bhor|Bhor]], [[Aundh|Aundh]], [[Phaltan|Phaltan]], [[Jath|Jath]] and [[Daphalpur|Daphalpur]]; the southern Maratha states, comprising [[Kolhapur|Kolhapur]] and other states, and [[Khairpur|Khairpur]] in Sind. The native states under the supervision of the government of Bombay are divided, historically and geographically, into two main groups. The northern or Gujarat group includes the territories of the gaekwar of Baroda, with the smaller states which form the administrative divisions of Cutch, Palanpur, Rewa Kantha, and Mahi Kantha. These territories, with the exception of Cutch, have an historical connection, as being the allies or tributaries of the Gaekwad until 1805, when final engagements were included between that prince and the British government. The southern or Maratha group includes Kolhapur, Akalkot, Sawantwari, and the Satara and southern Mahratta Jagirs, and has an historical bond of union in the friendship they showed to the British in their final struggle with the power of the peshwa until 1818. The remaining territories may conveniently be divided into a small cluster of independent [[zamindar|zamindar]]is, situated in the wild and hilly tracts at the northern extremity of the [[Sahyadri|Sahyadri]] range, and certain. principalities which, from their history or geographical position, are to some extent isolated from the rest of the presidency. -->
<!-- After the [[Revolt_of_1857|Revolt of 1857]], The British East India Company rule ceased, and India came under the control of the British Crown. The government of Bombay was administered by a governor in council consisting of the governor as president and two ordinary members. The governor was appointed from Britain; the council is appointed by the crown, and selected from the Indian civil service. These were the executive members of government. For making laws there was a legislative council, consisting of the governor and his executive council, with certain other persons, not fewer than eight or more than twenty, at least half of them being non-officials. Each of the members of the executive council had in his charge one or two departments of the government; and each department had a secretary, an under-secretary, and an assistant secretary, with a numerous staff of clerks. The political administration of the native states was under the superintendence of British agents placed at the principal native capitals; their position varied in different states according to the relations in which the principalities stood with the paramount power. The administration of justice throughout the presidency was conducted by a high court at Bombay, consisting of a chief justice and seven puisne judges, along with district and assistant judges throughout the districts of the presidency. The administration of the districts was carried on by collectors, assistant collectors, and a varying number of supernumerary assistants. -->

<!-- In [[1932|1932]], [[Aden_colony|Aden]] was separated from Bombay and made a separate province, and Sind became a separate province on [[April_1|April 1]] [[1936|1936]]. -->

==工业==
孟买管辖区的主要产业是棉纺织业。19世纪末蒸汽机在孟买、<!-- Ahmedabad and Khandesh -->普遍使用。1905年，在孟买管辖区有432座工厂，大部分都属于棉花<!-- preparation and manufacture。工业集中在孟买，有将近三分之二的工厂集中在那里。During the decade 1891-1901 the mill industry passed through a period of depression due to widespread plague and famine, but on the whole there was a marked expansion of the trade as well as a great improvement in the class of goods produced. In addition to the mills there were (1901) 178,000 hand-loom weavers in the province, who still have a position of their own in the manipulation of designs woven into the cloth. Silk goods were manufactured in [[Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad]], [[苏拉特|苏拉特]], [[Yeola|Yeola]], [[Nasik|Nasik]], [[塔那|塔那]]和[[孟买|孟买]], the material decorated with printed or woven designs;欧洲货物的竞争导致丝绸工业在20世纪初衰落。custom of investing savings in gold and silver ornaments gave employment to many goldsmiths: the metal was usually supplied by the customer, and the goldsmith charged for his labor. [[Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad]] and [[苏拉特|苏拉特]] are famous for their carved woodwork. Many of the houses in [[Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad]] are covered with elaborate wood-carving, and excellent examples exist in [[Broach|Broach]], [[Baroda|Baroda]], [[Surat|Surat]], [[Nasik|Nasik]] and [[Yeola|Yeola]]. Salt was made in large quantities in the government works at Kharaghoda and Udu in [[Ahmedabad|Ahmedabad]], and was is exported by rail to [[Gujarat|Gujarat]] and central India.

==交通==
<!-- The province was well supplied with railways, all of which, with one exception, concentrated at Bombay City. The exception is 西北 line, which enters Sind from the Punjab and terminated at Karachi. The other chief lines are the Great Indian Peninsula, Indian Midland, Bombay, Baroda & Central India, and the Rajputana, Malwa & Southern Mahratta systems. In 1905 the total length of railway under the Bombay government open for traffic was 7980 miles, which did not include the railway system in Sind. -->

==军事==
<!-- Under Lord Kitchener's re-arrangement of the Indian army in 1904 the old Bombay command was abolished and its place was taken by the Western army corps under a lieutenant-general.

The native states generally adopted the government system. Baroda and the Kathiawar states employed their own inspectors. In 1905 the total number of educational institutions was 10,194 with 593,431 pupils. There were ten art colleges, of which two were managed by government, three by native states, and five were under private management.

It enlarged the elected provincial assembly, and expanded provincial autonomy ''vis a vis'' 中央政府 -->。

==独立以后==
1947年，孟买省成为新独立的印度的一部分，而信德省成为[[巴基斯坦|巴基斯坦]]的一部分。1950年孟买省改称[[孟买邦|孟买邦]]，从前附属于孟买管辖区的土邦也并入新成立的邦。
