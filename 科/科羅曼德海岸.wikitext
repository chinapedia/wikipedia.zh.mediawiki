It could also be derived from ''Karai Mandalam'' or the ''coastal region''. Historically the Coromandel Coast generally referred to the stretch of coast between [[Point_Calimere|Point Calimere]] (Kodikkarai),靠近[[Kaveri河|Kaveri河]]三角洲, [[克里希纳河|克里希纳河]]口以北。 -->现在科罗曼德尔海岸分别由 [[泰米尔纳德邦|泰米尔纳德邦]]、[[安得拉邦|安得拉邦]]和[[本地治里|本地治里]]中央直辖区管辖。

== 描述 ==
科罗曼德尔海岸总体上地势低平，其间有几条河流的三角洲，<!-- including  Kaveri (Cauvery), [[Palar_River|Palar]], [[Penner_River|Penner]], and Krishna, which rise in the highlands of [[西高止山脉|西高止山脉]] and flow across [[Deccan|Deccan]] Plateau to drain into [[孟加拉湾|孟加拉湾]]. [[alluvial_plains|alluvial plains]] created by these rivers are fertile and favour agriculture. The coast is also known for its ports and harbours, [[Pulicat|Pulicat]],[[金奈|金奈]]、[[Sadras|Sadras]], Pondicherry, [[Karaikal|Karaikal]], [[Cuddalore|Cuddalore]], [[Tranquebar|Tranquebar]], [[Nagore|Nagore]], and [[Nagapattinam|Nagapattinam]], which take advantage of their close proximity with regions rich in natural and mineral resources (like the [[Chhattisgarh|Chhattisgarh]] belt and the mines of [[Golconda|Golconda]] and [[Kolar|Kolar]]) and/or good transport infrastructure. The planar geography of the region also favours urban growth and agglomerations.

科罗曼德尔海岸falls in [[rain_shadow|rain shadow]] of 西高止山脉, and receives a good deal less rainfall during 夏季[[西南季风|西南季风]], which contributes heavily to rainfall in the rest of India. The region averages 800 mm/year, most of which falls between October and December. The topography of the Bay of Bengal, and the staggered weather pattern prevalent during the season favours [[东北季风|东北季风]], which has a tendency to cause [[cyclone|cyclone]]s and [[hurricane|hurricane]]s rather than a steady precipitation. As a result, the coast is hit by inclement weather almost every year between October to January. The high variability of rainfall patterns are also responsible for water scarcity and famine in most areas not served by the great rivers. For example, the city of Chennai is one of the driest cities in the country in terms of potable water availability, despite high percentage of moisture in the air, due to the unpredictable, seasonal nature of the monsoon.

科罗曼德尔海岸is home to [[East_Deccan_dry_evergreen_forests|East Deccan dry evergreen forests]] [[ecoregion|ecoregion]], which runs in a narrow strip along the coast.不像印度其他大部分[[热带_and_亚热带_dry_阔叶林|热带干树林]]区域，where the trees lose their leaves during the dry season, the East Deccan dry evergreen forests retain their leathery leaves year round. The Coromandel coast is also home to extensive [[mangrove|mangrove]] forests along the low-lying coast and river deltas, and several important [[wetland|wetland]]s, notably [[Kaliveli_Lake|Kaliveli Lake]] and [[Pulicat_Lake|Pulicat Lake]], that provide habitat to thousands of migrating and resident [[bird|bird]]s. -->

== 历史 ==
<!-- 科罗曼德尔海岸是欧洲列强在17和18世纪为控制印度贸易进行竞争的角逐场所。[[英国|英国]]人建造了[[圣乔治堡|圣乔治堡]]（马德拉斯）和[[Masulipatnam|Masulipatnam]]，[[荷兰|荷兰]]控制了普里卡特和 Sadras, [[法国|法国]]控制本地治里, Karaikal和[[Nizampatnam|Nizampatnam]]，而[[丹麦|丹麦]]控制 Dansborg at Tranquebar. 

最终英国人获得了胜利，尽管法国人保留了 tiny enclaves of 本地治里和Karaikal until 1954. [[中国|中国]] [[漆器|漆器]], including boxes, screens, and chests, became known as "Coromandel" goods in 18世纪，因为许多中国出口货物consolidated at 科罗曼德尔海岸港口。

[[December_26|December 26]] [[2004|2004]], one of the deadliest natural disasters in modern history,[[印度洋海啸|印度洋海啸]], struck off the western coast of [[苏门答腊岛|苏门答腊岛]] (Indonesia). The [[earthquake|earthquake]] and subsequent tsunami reportedly killed over 220,000 people around the rim of [[印度洋|印度洋]]. The tsunami devastated 科罗曼德尔海岸, killing many and sweeping away many coastal communities. -->
