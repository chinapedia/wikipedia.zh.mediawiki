==生平==

;高雲地利
Born in [[Solihull|Solihull]], Eustace began his career as a trainee at [[Coventry_City_F.C.|Coventry City]]. Despite the fact that he was at the club for seven years, he only recorded 98 appearances in all competitions due to injuries. At 19 he went out on loan to [[Dundee_United_F.C.|Dundee United]] to gain first team experience. He played eleven matches and scored one goal against Hearts,<ref>{{cite web

|date=15 May 1999 |accessdate=21 February 2010}}</ref> becoming a firm favourite with United fans who voted him their young player of the year. 

He returned to Coventry where he began to establish himself in the first team. In the [[2000-01_in_English_football|2000–01 season]], he appeared in 32 league games. Despite his efforts, the club were relegated from the [[F.A._Premier_League|Premier League]].  At the start of the next season, he was named as captain by manager [[Gordon_Strachan|Gordon Strachan]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Eustace takes over captain's armband |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-77342707.html |author=encyclopedia.com |date=August 20, 2001}}</ref> However on 8 September 2001, Eustace was struck down with a knee injury during Coventry's league defeat to Grimsby which kept him sidelined for 7 months. He returned to action in April 2002.<ref name="Eustace on road back">{{cite news

Eustace's Stoke career started brightly. He made his debut at Stoke in a 3–0 win over [[Derby_County_F.C.|Derby County]] at the start of the [[2003-04_in_English_football|2003–04 season]] and the midfielder helped the side to 11th place in the [[Football_League_Championship|Championship]], scoring five goals. Unfortunately, injury problems restricted him to a handful of appearances over the next two seasons – in The Potters 1–0 win over [[Wigan_Athletic_F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] in February 2005,<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4218221.stm Wigan 0–1 Stoke]</ref> Eustace suffered a knee injury and was then substituted, in only his 8th appearance of the season. It later became clear that Eustace's injury would keep him out for at least the rest of the season.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/4362753.stm Eustace could miss rest of season]</ref> He missed the rest of the [[2004-05_in_English_football|2004–05 season]] and all of the [[2005-06_in_English_football|2005–06 season]] because of the injury. However, Eustace signed a 1 year contract extension at the beginning of the season, which lasted until the end of the [[2006-07_in_English_football|2006–07 season]].

Eustace returned from his long injury lay off in June 2006.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stoke_city/5120426.stm Pulis pleased by Eustace progress]</ref> He made his first appearance for Stoke City in over 18 months in their 2–0 friendly win over local opposition [[Newcastle_Town_F.C.|Newcastle Town]]. On 13 October 2006, Eustace joined [[Hereford_United_F.C.|Hereford United]] on loan to gain first team football to aid his comeback.<ref name="Hereford seal Eustace loan deal">{{cite news

Eustace returned to the Stoke starting line up in the 3rd round [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] match against [[Millwall_F.C.|Millwall]]. On 11 February 2007, he started his first league match of the season in Stoke's 1–0 loss to [[Birmingham_City_F.C.|Birmingham City]]. In total, Eustace made 23 league appearances over the course of the season for Stoke and Hereford. Eustace later signed a one-year contract extension with the club, to take him up until the summer of 2008.<ref name="Stoke City duo sign new contracts">{{cite news

On 31 January 2008, Eustace joined [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] from Stoke City for a fee of £250,000.<ref>{{cite news |title = Stoke's Eustace moves to Watford|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/7220695.stm | publisher = bbc.co.uk |date = 2009-03-09 |accessdate = 2007-03-09}}</ref> Since signing, Eustace has impressed the Hornets fans with his tough tackling, no-nonsense attitude, and his passing skills and composure on the ball – something Watford had lacked in the centre of midfield before his arrival.  On 20 September 2008, Eustace "scored" a bizarre opening [[own_goal|own goal]] in the game between [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] and [[Reading_F.C.|Reading]], where a goalmouth scramble saw the ball go nowhere near the goal line, despite the [[Assistant_referee_(association_football)|linesman]] flagging for a goal to the bemusement of everyone in the ground. A corner from [[Stephen_Hunt_(footballer_born_1981)|Stephen Hunt]] bounced off of Eustace and was hooked back by [[Noel_Hunt|Noel Hunt]]. What could have been a debatable corner for Reading, initially given as a goal kick, was actually then given as a goal. The game ended Watford 2–2 Reading.<ref>{{cite web

|publisher=[[BBC|BBC]] 
|date=20 September 2008 |accessdate=25 August 2009}}</ref> Despite playing well, Eustace found his opportunities limited during his second season with the Hornets. 

On 9 March 2009 he joined Championship rivals [[Derby_County_F.C.|Derby County]] on loan until the end of the 2008/09 season, in order to help solve the Rams' midfield injury crisis.<ref>{{cite news |title = Watford Midfielder Joins Rams on Loan |url=http://therams.co.uk/stories/watford-midfielder-set-to-join-rams-on-loan| publisher = therams.co.uk |date = 2009-03-09 |accessdate = 2007-03-09}}</ref> He made his Derby debut in the 1–1 draw away to [[Southampton_F.C.|Southampton]], and scored against his parent club on the final day of the season.<ref>{{cite web

If he's still in the same situation at the start of next season, needing a loan, then we might look at that."<ref>{{cite news |title = Eustace will go back to Watford|url=http://therams.co.uk/stories/eustace-will-go-back-to-watford| publisher = therams.co.uk |date = 2009-05-06 |accessdate = 2007-05-08}}</ref>

With his Hornet's career seemingly in jeopardy, Eustace signed an amended contract stipulating that he would not receive his sizeable appearance fee, freeing up [[Malky_Mackay|Malky Mackay]] to pick the tenacious midfielder. After being handed the number 28 jersey for the season, Eustace went on to play an instrumental role as [[Watford|Watford]] retained their [[Coca_Cola_Championship|Coca Cola Championship]] status for another season. Eustace was also handed the captaincy on a number of occasions with first-choice skipper [[Jay_DeMerit|Jay DeMerit]] sidelined through injury. Eustace made over forty appearances in league and cup competitions and was the 'Player's Player of the Season' as voted by his peers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~2063441,00.html|title=Eustace signs!|publisher=Watford Football Club|accessdate=10 February 2011|date=3 June 2010}}</ref>

After much speculation throughout the [[2009–10_Watford_F.C._season|2009–10]] [[off-season|off-season]], Eustace finally put pen-to-paper on a new two-year contract with [[Watford|Watford]]. Eustace and Mackay later revealed that he had passed a medical at [[Leeds_United_A.F.C.|Leeds United]], and that there was interest from other clubs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/8718175.stm|title=John Eustace explains Watford decision|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 February 2011|date=4 June 2010}}</ref>

Ahead of the [[2010–11_Watford_F.C._season|season]], [[Watford|Watford]] boss [[Malky_Mackay|Malky Mackay]] handed Eustace the captaincy, after [[USA|USA]] international DeMerit was released on a [[bosman_transfer|bosman transfer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~2064203,00.html|title=Captain Eustace sets the record straight|publisher=Watford Football Club|accessdate=10 February 2011|date=4 June 2010}}</ref> He started the season in good form, scoring Watford's first goal of the season in a 3–2 win at [[Norwich_City_F.C.|Norwich City]], followed a week later with an over-head finish in a 2–2 draw against former club Coventry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8880936.stm|title=Norwich 2–3 Watford|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Saj|last=Chowdhury|accessdate=10 February 2011|date=6 August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/8336486.Eustace_in_team_of_the_week/|title=Watford captain John Eustace named in Championship team of the week|publisher=Newsquest|work=Watford Observer|accessdate=10 February 2011|date=17 August 2010|first=Joe|last=Whitbread}}</ref>
