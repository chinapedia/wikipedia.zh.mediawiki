:Old John Brown’s body lies moldering in the grave,
:While weep the sons of bondage whom he ventured all to save;
:But tho he lost his life while struggling for the slave,
:His soul is marching on.

:John Brown was a hero, undaunted, true and brave,
:And Kansas knows his valor when he fought her rights to save;
:Now, tho the grass grows green above his grave,
:His soul is marching on.

:He captured Harper’s Ferry, with his nineteen men so few,
:And frightened "Old Virginny" till she trembled thru and thru;
:They hung him for a traitor, they themselves the traitor crew,
:But his soul is marching on.

:John Brown was John the Baptist of the Christ we are to see,
:Christ who of the bondmen shall the Liberator be,
:And soon thruout the Sunny South the slaves shall all be free,
:For his soul is marching on.

:The conflict that he heralded he looks from heaven to view,
:On the army of the Union with its flag red, white and blue.
:And heaven shall ring with anthems o’er the deed they mean to do,
:For his soul is marching on.

:Ye soldiers of Freedom, then strike, while strike ye may,
:The death blow of oppression in a better time and way,
:For the dawn of old John Brown has brightened into day,
:And his soul is marching on.
