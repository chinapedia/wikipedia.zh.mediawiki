The most common rendering in English is:
<blockquote>''"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."''</blockquote>

“[It] is clear that in the translation “the Word was God,” the term God is being used to denote his nature or essence, and not his person. But in normal English usage “God” is a proper noun, referring to the [[God_the_Father|person of the Father]] or corporately to the three persons of the [[Godhead_(Christianity)|Godhead]]. Moreover, “the Word was God” suggests that “the Word” and “God” are convertible terms, that the proposition is reciprocating. But the Word is neither the Father nor the [[Trinity|Trinity]]… The rendering cannot stand without explanation.”<ref>Harris, Murray J. ;''Jesus as God: The New Testament Use of Theos in Reference to Jesus'', 1992. <Murray J. Harris. Baker Books, pub. SBN 0801021952, p. 69</ref> Translations by [[James_Moffatt|James Moffatt]], [[Hugh_J._Schonfield|Hugh J. Schonfield]] and Edgar Goodspeed render part of the verse as ''"...and the Word was divine."''

An Orthodox Bible Commentary notes: "This second ''theos'' could also be translated ‘divine’ as the construction indicates "a qualitative sense for theos". The Word is ''not'' God in the sense that he is the ''same person'' as the ''theos'' mentioned in 1:1a; he is not [[God_the_Father|God the Father]] (God absolutely as in common [[New_Testament|NT]] usage) or the [[Trinity|Trinity]]. The point being made is that the [[Christ_the_Logos|Logos]] is of the ''same uncreated nature'' or essence as [[God_the_Father|God the Father]], with whom he eternally exists. This verse is echoed in the [[Nicene_Creed|Nicene Creed]]: '[[God_the_Son|God]] (qualitative or derivative) from [[God_the_Father|God]] (personal, the [[God_the_Father|Father]]), Light from Light, True God from True God… ''[[Homoousian|homoousion]]'' with the Father.'"<ref>[[Eastern_/_Greek_Orthodox_Bible|Eastern / Greek Orthodox Bible]], [http://www.orthodox-church.info/eob/download/nt6x9.pdf New Testament], 2009, p231.</ref>

{{Quotation|The text of John 1:1 has a sordid past and a myriad of interpretations. With the Greek alone, we can create empathic, orthodox, creed-like statements, or we can commit pure and unadulterated heresy. From the point of view of early church history, heresy develops when a misunderstanding arises concerning Greek articles, the predicate nominative, and grammatical word order. The early church heresy of Sabellianism understood John 1:1c to read, "and the Word was ''the'' God." The early church heresy of Arianism understood it to read, "and the word was ''a'' God."|David A. Reed<ref>David A. Reed. "How Semetic Was John? Rethinking the Hellenistic Background to John 1:1." ''Anglican Theological Review,'' Fall 2003, Vol. 85 Issue 4, p709</ref>}}

There are two issues affecting the translating of the verse, [[theology|theology]] and proper application of grammatical rules. The commonly held theology that Jesus is God naturally leads one to believe that the proper way to render the verse is the one which is most popular.<ref>William Arnold III, [http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/colwell.htm Colwell's Rule and John 1:1] {{Wayback|url=http://www.apostolic.net/biblicalstudies/colwell.htm |date=20120617211507 }} at apostolic.net: "You could only derive a Trinitarian interpretation from John 1:1 if you come to this passage with an already developed Trinitarian theology. If you approached it with a strict [[Monotheism|Monotheism]] (which is what I believe John held to) then this passage would definitely support such a view."</ref> The opposing theology that Jesus is subordinate to God as his Chief agent leads to the conclusion that ''"... a god"'' or ''"... divine"'' is the proper rendering.<ref>Beduhn in ''Truth in Translation: Accuracy and Bias in English Translations of the New Testament'' chapter 11 states:
"Translators of the [[KJV|KJV]], [[NRSV|NRSV]], [[NIV|NIV]], [[New_American_Bible|NAB]], [[New_American_Standard_Bible|New American Standard Bible]], AB, [[Good_News_Bible|Good News Bible]] and [[The_Living_Bible|LB]] all approached the text at John 1:1 already believing certain things about the Word...and made sure that the translations came out in accordance with their beliefs.... Ironically, some of these same scholars are quick to charge the NW translation with "doctrinal bias" for translating the verse literally, free of KJV influence, following the sense of the Greek. It may very well be that the NW translators came to the task of translating John 1:1 with as much bias as the other translators did. It just so happens that their bias corresponds in this case to a more accurate translation of the Greek."</ref> Some scholars staunchly oppose the translation ''...a god'',<ref>Dr. J. R. Mantey: "It is neither scholarly nor reasonable to translate John 1:1 'The Word was a god.'"</ref><ref>Dr. Bruce M. Metzger of Princeton (Professor of New Testament Language and Literature): "As a matter of solid fact, however, such a rendering is a frightful mistranslation. It overlooks entirely an established rule of Greek grammar which necessitates the rendering "...and the Word was God."</ref><ref>Dr. Samuel J. Mikolaski of Zurich, Switzerland: "It is monstrous to translate the phrase 'the Word was a god.'"</ref> while other scholars believe it is possible or even preferable.<ref>Dr. Jason BeDuhn (of Northern Arizona University) in regard to the Kingdom Interlinear's appendix that gives the reason why the NWT favoured a translation of John 1:1 as saying the Word was not "God" but "a god" said: "In fact the KIT [Appendix 2A, p.1139] explanation is perfectly correct according to the best scholarship done on this subject.."</ref><ref>Murray J. Harris has written: "Accordingly, from the point of view of grammar alone, [QEOS HN hO LOGOS] could be rendered "the Word was a god,...." -''Jesus As God'', 1992, p. 60.</ref><ref>C. H. Dodd says: "If a translation were a matter of substituting words, a possible translation of [QEOS EN hO LOGOS]; would be, "The Word was a god". As a word-for-word translation it cannot be faulted."</ref>

A major point of contention, since the “[[神|神]]（{{lang-el|theos}}）” in question occurs without the definite article (the), within the grammatical debate is the proper application of ''Colwell's rule'',<ref>[http://www.theologue.org/downloads/colwell.pdf Colwell]</ref> set out by Greek scholar [[Ernst_Cadman_Colwell|E. C. Colwell]], which states:

<blockquote>"In sentences in which the copula is expressed, a definite predicate nominative has the article when it follows the verb; it does not have the article when it precedes the verb."</blockquote>

At issue is whether Colwell's rule applies to John 1:1 and if it is a reliable standard by which grammatical constructions of this type should be measured. It has been pointed out that Colwell's rule does ''not'' help by determining definiteness.<ref> [http://books.google.com/books?id=XlqoTVsk2wcC&pg=PA257&lpg=PA257#v=onepage&q&f=false Wallace Greek Grammar] [http://books.google.com/books?id=LtRYzGnRvdMC&pg=PT147&lpg=PT147=false NT syntax] [http://www.angelfire.com/space/thegospeltruth/trinity/verses/Jn1_1.html John 1.1] [http://onlytruegod.org/defense/metzgercolwell.htm NWT]</ref>  Apparently, it has been misapplied by some to defend the deity of Christ.<ref>[http://www.ubs-translations.org/tbt/1964/03/TBT196403.html?seq=50 Metzger] Rodney J. Decker. Web: [http://ntresources.com/documents/colwell.pdf A Summary of Colwell's Rule] 19 Nov. 2009</ref>

Daniel B. Wallace argues that the use of the anarthrous theos (the lack of the definite article before the second ''theos'') is due to its use as a qualitative noun, describing the nature or essence of the Word, not due to Colwell's rule.<ref>Daniel B. Wallace, Greek Grammar Beyond the Basics: An Exegetical Syntax of the New Testament</ref><ref name=anarthrous-theos/>

The rendering as "a god" is justified by some non-trinitarians by comparing it with Acts 28:6 where they claim that the grammatical construction is the same.<ref>

However, it was noted that the Hebrew words El, HaElohim and Yahweh (all referring to God) were rendered as anarthrous theos in the Septuagint at {{bibleverse||Nahum|1:2|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Isaiah|37:16|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|41:4|HE}}, {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|23:23|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Ezekiel|45:9|HE}} among many other locations.

Actual usage of the Sahidic Coptic common noun "noute" (ΝΟΥΤЄ) in the Coptic New Testament at John 1:1 suggests that it is a count noun that, when bound with the Coptic indefinite article, should be translated into English as "a god."

However, the reason for using the indefinite article in the Coptic translation is that the meaning is qualitative. Many such occurrences for qualitative nouns are identified in the Coptic New Testament, including {{bibleverse|1|John|1:5}} and {{bibleverse|1|John|4:8}}. Moreover the indefinite article is used to refer to God in {{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|4:31|HE}} and {{bibleverse||Malachi|2:10|HE}}, so the assumption that an indefinite article favors the translation "a god" is a void assumption. 

Coptic scholar George Horner renders the Sahidic Coptic of John 1:1c as 
"and [a] God was the word." while his apparatus mentions "Square brackets imply words used by the Coptic and not required by the English".<ref>[https://sites.google.com/site/christiantopics2020/coptic-john-1-1 Coptic John 1:1: Another Lie to Justify the NWT?] </ref>

在《[[四福音书|四福音书]]》中，《约翰福音》有着 the highest explicit 基督论. Here 耶稣 is the only begotten [[上帝的儿子|上帝的儿子]]，道路、真理、生命，[[圣经中的葡萄树|真葡萄树]]，等等。In 1:1, John identifies Jesus as the ''Logos'', that which made the existence of the created world possible.

在对[[福音书作者约翰|福音书作者约翰]]的[[基督论|基督论]]的基督教“正统”理解中，the conception that “[[耶稣基督|耶稣基督]]是那位[[逻各斯|逻各斯]]” has been important in establishing the doctrine of Jesus' [[divinity|divinity]], as well as that of the [[三位一体|三位一体]], as set forth in the [[Chalcedonian_Creed|Chalcedonian Creed]].

The debate about the nature of [[基督|基督]] from the first century through the [[Council_of_Chalcedon|Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 CE must be understood in light of the pervasive world view of ''Platonic [[dualism|dualism]]''. [[Platonism|Platonism]] is normally divided into four periods: Old Academy (347-267 BCE), New Academy (267-80 BCE), Middle Platonism (80BCE-250 CE), and [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonism]] (250 CE through the [[Protestant_Reformation|Reformation]]).<ref>Edwin Moore: ''Neoplatonism'' in The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, available at [http://www.iep.utm.edu/n/neoplato.htm].</ref><ref>J.M.

一些[[圣经学者|圣经学者]]{{Who|date=June 2010}} have suggested that John made creative use of double meaning in the word "Logos" to communicate to both [[Jew|Jew]]s, who were familiar with the [[Wisdom_tradition|Wisdom tradition]] in [[Judaism|Judaism]], and [[Hellenistic_religion|Hellenic polytheism]], especially followers of [[Philo|Philo]], often called [[Hellenistic_Judaism|Hellenistic Judaism]]. Each of these two groups had its own history associated with the concept of the Logos, and each could understand John's use of the term from one or both of those contexts. Especially for the Hellenists, however, John turns the concept of the Logos on its head when he claimed "the ''Logos'' became flesh and dwelt among us" (v. 14).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[Gordon_Clark|Gordon Clark]] translated ''Logos'' as "Logic" in the opening verses of the Gospel: "In the beginning was the Logic, and the Logic was with God and the Logic was God." He meant to imply by this translation that the [[classical_logic|laws of logic]] were contained in the Bible itself and were therefore not a [[secular|secular]] principle imposed on the Christian [[worldview|worldview]].
