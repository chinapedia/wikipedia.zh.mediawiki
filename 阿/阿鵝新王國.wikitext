<!--==劇情==
After Gunter (voiced by [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]]) manages to steal the Ice King's (voiced by Kenny) Demonic Wishing Eye, he creates magical clones of himself with which he uses to take over Ooo. Meanwhile, the Ice King journeys to Wizard City to buy a new Demonic Wishing Eye only to be accosted and nearly killed by Laser Wizard, Bufo, and Forest Wizard, who form some sort of [[secret_society|secret wizard society]].

Finn and Jake are soon alerted to the magical Gunter clones, which are also able to shape-shift. The duo observe that Gunter and his army have seemingly conquered the entirety of Ooo, save for the Candy Kingdom. The two rush to Princess Bubblegum's (voiced by [[Hynden_Walch|Hynden Walch]]) aid, only for Gunter to conquer the city in one fell swoop. It is revealed that Gunter only wants to conquer the world to satisfy his love for glass breaking bottles. Gunter and his army are nearly about to crack the heads of the Gumball Guardians, when the Ice King shows up and scolds Gunter, who removes the Demonic Wishing Eye, returning Ooo to normal.

"Reign of Gunters" was written and storyboarded by [[Ako_Castuera|Ako Castuera]] and [[Jesse_Moynihan|Jesse Moynihan]], from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], and [[Adam_Muto|Adam Muto]]. The episode was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Reign of Gunters| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Ako Castuera & Jesse Moynihan (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=October 8, 2012| season = 4 | number = 24}}</ref> The impetus for this episode was a scene that appeared in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_2)|second season]] premiere, "[[It_Came_from_the_Nightosphere|It Came from the Nightosphere]]" that features Marceline's dad confronting Gunter the penguin and calling him the most "the most evil thing [he has] encountered."<ref name=kent>Osborne, Kent (Storyboard artist). 2013. "It Came from the Nightosphere" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Two [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> The opening of the episode was based on Castuera's cat, Katie, who would often want to be brushed.<ref name=castuerapenguins>Castuera, Ako (Storyboard artist). 2014.

The episode introduces Wizard City. Denizens of Wizard City featured in this episode include: Bufo, voiced by [[Steve_Little_(actor)|Steve Little]]; Forest Wizard, voiced by Ward; and Lazer Wizard, voiced by [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]].<ref name=wardpenguins/> The episode also introduced Huntress Wizard. The original design for the character, crafted by Ako, resembled a female [[wrestler|wrestler]]. Michelle Xin, however, redesigned the character.<ref name=castuerapenguins/><ref name=jessepenguins/> Moynihan also placed one of his comic character in the background of the city, but changed the design so that Cartoon Network would not own the rights to the character.<ref name=jessepenguins/>

The scene wherein Gunter's baby begins to float and shoot laser in order to incapacitate the Candy Kingdom was pitched by Ward and only begrudgingly added into the episode by Moynihan; he noted that he initially thought the idea was silly, but eventually came to like it.<ref name=jessepenguins/><ref name=wardpenguins/> The scene in which Jake rebuilds a broken bottle was re-storyboarded by Ward after he decided he wanted to make Jake reconstruct it to a beat. Because of the number of poses, the scene ended up taking more time than is usual to draw.<ref name=castuerapenguins/><ref name=wardpenguins/>

==Reception==

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "C+". Sava compared the installment to the previous fourth season episode "[[BMO_Noire|BMO Noire]]", but noted that while the latter "builds a story around one of the supporting character that is primarily defined by being cute and lonely", "Reign of Gunters" does not "add anything to the character [of Gunter], making it feel like a one-off joke stretched to fill 10 minutes."<ref name=avclubpenguin/> He also felt that it would have been more enjoyable to watch the action unfold between Ice King and the secret wizard society, because he felt that the action taking place at the Candy Kingdom, while fun, was not very exciting. Despite this, Sava noted that the best part of the episode was when Finn explains to Jake that he is keeping his lady friends in a state of confusion in order to pursue potential romantic relationships with them in the future.<ref name=avclubpenguin>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Adventure Time: 'Reign of Gunters'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-reign-of-gunthers-85975|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
