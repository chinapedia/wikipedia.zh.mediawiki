;水晶宮
Pardew moved to [[Football_League_Second_Division|Football League Second Division]] side [[Crystal_Palace_F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 1987 for a fee of £7,500.<ref name="Charlton profile"/> In 1989, he helped Palace win promotion to the [[Football_League_First_Division|First Division]] after beating [[Blackburn_Rovers_F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in the [[Football_League_Championship_play-offs#1989|play-offs]]. The following year, in 1990, he scored the winning goal as Palace memorably beat [[Liverpool_F.C.|Liverpool]] 4–3 after extra-time in a thrilling [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] semi-final at [[Villa_Park_(stadium)|Villa Park]]. He then played in both the final and the final [[Replay_(sports)|replay]] as Palace [[FA_Cup_Final_1990|lost]] to [[Manchester_United_F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref name="Charlton profile"/>

;末年
Pardew moved to [[Charlton_Athletic_F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] in November 1991, and was Charlton's top scorer in the [[1992–93_in_English_football|1992–93]] season with ten goals.<ref name="Charlton profile"/> In 1995, Pardew appeared four times on loan at [[Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[1995_UEFA_Intertoto_Cup|1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. He played in the team who suffered the embarrassment of being involved in Spurs' record defeat in the history of the club, when they lost 8–0 away to German side [[1._FC_Köln|1. FC Köln]]. Spurs had fielded a team made up of reserves and loanees, including Pardew, for their final group game in Cologne.<ref name="Charlton profile"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/no-picnic-for-english-clubs-by-the-sea-1588438.html|title=No picnic for English clubs by the sea |publisher=[[The_Independent|The Independent]] |date=26 June 1995 |accessdate=7 November 2009| location=London| first=Phil| last=Shaw| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091122205124/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/no-picnic-for-english-clubs-by-the-sea-1588438.html| archivedate= 22 November 2009 | deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tottenham, Liverpool, Man United and six of the biggest defeats in Europe|url=http://www.talksport.co.uk/magazine/features/2011-04-13/tottenham-liverpool-man-united-and-six-biggest-defeats-europe|publisher=Talksport|accessdate=6 May 2013}}</ref>

After rejecting an opportunity to play in [[Hong_Kong|Hong Kong]],<ref name="Charlton profile"/> Pardew then moved to [[Barnet_F.C.|Barnet]], and became a [[player-coach|player-coach]] under manager [[Terry_Bullivant|Terry Bullivant]].

;國家隊
At international level Pardew was a member of the [[England_C_national_football_team|England Semi-Professional]] squad during his time in the English non-League playing for Dulwich Hamlet and Yeovil Town.

Pardew's first experience as manager came in March 1998 when he was appointed as [[Caretaker_manager|caretaker]] after the departure of Bullivant. After the appointment of [[Tommy_Burns_(footballer)|Tommy Burns]] he remained as reserve team manager until the end of the [[1998–99_in_English_football|1998–99]] season, when Reading disbanded their reserve team.<ref>{{cite web| title = Alan Pardew managerial profile| url = http://www.leaguemanagers.com/manager/profile-348.html| publisher = League Managers Association| date = | accessdate =21 September 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070810130238/http://www.leaguemanagers.com/manager/profile-348.html| archivedate= 10 August 2007 | deadurl= no}}</ref> Nevertheless, he was promoted to manager of the club after a successful spell as caretaker in 1999. He turned the club around from relegation fighters to promotion candidates through players, such as [[Jamie_Cureton|Jamie Cureton]], and his régime to increase the fitness of the squad. Pardew also coined his motto "Tenacity, Spirit and Flair" to give his side a psychological edge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

Pardew's Reading side lost 3–2 to [[Walsall_F.C.|Walsall]] in a [[2001_Football_League_Second_Division_play-off_Final|Division Two playoff final]] at the end of the [[2000–01_in_English_football|2000–01]] season, but this was redeemed the next season as the club achieved automatic promotion to Division One. Pardew's first season in the higher division was impressive, as the club finished fourth. They lost in the play-offs once again, this time to [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Pardew was starting to gain a reputation as one of the game's best up and coming young managers.

Early into the [[2003–04_in_English_football|2003–04]] season, [[West_Ham_United_F.C.|West Ham United]] asked Reading permission to appoint Pardew as their new manager. Although Reading refused permission, Pardew [[resigned|resigned]] from his position forcing the issue.

In the [[2006–07_in_English_football|2006–07 season]], Pardew was criticised after seeing West Ham through their worst run of defeats in over 70 years which included an exit from the [[UEFA_Europa_League|UEFA Cup]] to [[U.S._Città_di_Palermo|Palermo]] in the very first round<ref>{{cite news| title = Palermo 3–0 West Ham (agg: 4–0)| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/5384280.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 26 September 2006| accessdate =13 December 2010}}</ref> and a [[Football_League_Cup|League Cup]] defeat to [[Chesterfield_F.C.|Chesterfield]].<ref>{{cite news| title = Pardew humiliated after cup exit| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/6082588.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 25 October 2006| accessdate =30 August 2007}}</ref>  West Ham's new owners stated their support for Pardew,<ref>{{cite news| title = Pardew backed by West Ham bidder| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/6041932.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 12 October 2006| accessdate =21 September 2007| first=John| last=Sinnott}}</ref> but on 11 December 2006, following a 4–0 defeat away at [[Bolton_Wanderers_F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] the previous weekend, it was announced that Pardew had been sacked by West Ham.

Many expected Charlton to bounce back from relegation into the Premier League with signings such as [[Chris_Iwelumo|Chris Iwelumo]] and [[Luke_Varney|Luke Varney]] in the 2007–08 season. But Charlton failed to mount a serious promotion challenge and finished the season in 11th. This put Pardew under pressure going into the 2008–09 season but Charlton started the season off well with victories over Reading and Swansea. However, Charlton's form very quickly deteriorated and they were near the foot of the table after 8 games without a win. After an inept display in a 5–2 home defeat to [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United]] hundreds of supporters remained for more than an hour to condemn their manager, chanting, "We want Pardew out" and "We want our club back" after Charlton had slipped into the Championship's bottom three.<ref>{{cite news| title = Charlton 2–5 Sheff Utd | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7727279.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 22 November 2008| accessdate =9 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| title = Alan Pardew and Charlton Athletic go their separate ways | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/charlton-athletic/3503383/Alan-Pardew-and-Charlton-Athletic-go-their-separate-ways-Football.html| publisher = www.telegraph.co.uk| date = 22 November 2008| accessdate =9 December 2010| location=London| first=Huw| last=Turbervill}}</ref> On 22 November 2008, Pardew parted company with Charlton by mutual consent.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/charlton_athletic/7744263.stm Pardew and Charlton part company] BBC Sport</ref>

His first league match in charge was against [[Millwall_F.C.|Millwall]] on 8 August, which ended in a 1–1 draw. He brought many new signings to the club including notable [[League_One|League One]] strikers [[Rickie_Lambert|Rickie Lambert]] and [[Lee_Barnard|Lee Barnard]], the first of whom cost more than £1 million. Pardew led his side up the League One table and despite their 10 point deduction, their challenge for a playoff place was kept alive until there were just two league games remaining.

Pardew led Southampton to the [[2010_Football_League_Trophy_Final|2010 Football League Trophy Final]] at [[Wembley_Stadium|Wembley]], where they won 4–1 against [[Carlisle_United_F.C.|Carlisle United]].

[[Andy_Woodman|Andy Woodman]] was also Pardew's appointment as goalkeeping coach. Soon afterwards Pardew, however, suffered one of the most embarrassing defeats in the club's history as Newcastle went down 3–1 to League 2 side [[Stevenage_F.C.|Stevenage]] in the 3rd round of the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_6642955,00.html |title=Newcastle United | Football | Premier League | Pardew apologises for upset |publisher=Sky Sports |date= 8 January 2011|accessdate=10 January 2011}}</ref>

However, the following month Pardew led the Magpies to one of the most memorable moments in the club's recent history when Newcastle drew 4–4 with [[Arsenal_F.C.|Arsenal]] in an enthralling match at St James' Park on 5 February 2011. Newcastle were 4–0 down by half time only to come back to level the match. This has been seen as one of the most remarkable comebacks in Premier League history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nufc.co.uk/articles/20110206/the-best-comeback-ever-leon_2281670_2286803 |title=Newcastle United | News | Latest News | Latest News | The Best Comeback Ever - Leon |publisher=Nufc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnstar.com/football/premier-league/news/detail/item579408/Andrew-Leci:-Goals-Galore!/# |title=Football | Barclays Premier League | Andrew Leci: Goals Galore! |publisher=Espnstar.Com |date= |accessdate=11 February 2011}}</ref> He secured Newcastle's safety in the Premier League with a 2–1 win over [[Birmingham_City|Birmingham City]] on 7 May 2011, with the club in mid-table.

However, in this match they let a 3–0 goal lead slip meaning they would finish outside the top 10 in 12th place.

In the summer of 2011, Pardew bought many French speaking players such as [[Yohan_Cabaye|Yohan Cabaye]], [[Sylvain_Marveaux|Sylvain Marveaux]] and French-born Senegalese striker, [[Demba_Ba|Demba Ba]].<ref>http://www.nufcblog.com/2011/07/08/coloccini-an-honor-to-be-newcastle-united-captain/ comments</ref> At the start of the 2011–12 season, Pardew led Newcastle to their best start to a Premier League campaign in 17 years, with an unbeaten run of eleven matches in all competitions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Edwards|first=Luke|title=Newcastle United 2 Tottenham Hotspur 2: match report |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/8827582/Newcastle-United-2-Tottenham-Hotspur-2-match-report.html|publisher=[[Daily_Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=17 October 2011|date=16 October 2011|location=London}}</ref>

In January 2012, Pardew signed Senegalese striker [[Papiss_Cissé|Papiss Cissé]] from Bundesliga side [[SC_Freiburg|SC Freiburg]]. This was another pivotal signing in the resurgence of Newcastle, as he scored 13 goals in 12 games.

Two days prior to the final match of the season, Pardew won the [[Premier_League_Manager_of_the_Season|Premier League Manager of the Season]] award, becoming the first Newcastle United manager to achieve this. He was given the award after an impressive season with Newcastle where he guided them to a European place for the following season.<ref name="BBC Sport">{{cite web|title=Newcastle United's Alan Pardew named manager of the season|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18042404|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=11 May 2012|date=11 May 2012}}</ref> He also won the [[League_Managers_Association_Awards#LMA_Manager_of_the_Year|League Managers Association Manager of the Year]] award, which made him the first and only English manager to win the two individual awards in a single Premier League season.<ref name="LMAWINNER">{{cite news |title=Alan Pardew wins LMA award 2012 |url=http://www.leaguemanagers.com/news/news-7005.html |work=LMA |publisher=LMA |date=14 May 2012 |accessdate=17 May 2012}}</ref> On 27 September 2012, Pardew signed an eight-year contract extension with the club.<ref>{{cite web|title=Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew has signed a new eight-year contract|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11678/8114243/Newcastle-United-manager-Alan-Pardew-has-been-signed-a-new-eight-year-contract|publisher=Skysports.com}}</ref>

During the 2013 January transfer window Pardew signed a number of players from [[Ligue_1|Ligue 1]] in [[France|France]] including Internationals such as [[Mapou_Yanga-Mbiwa|Mapou Yanga-Mbiwa]], [[Mathieu_Debuchy|Mathieu Debuchy]] and [[Moussa_Sissoko|Moussa Sissoko]] to help boost Newcastle's season. The new signings helped Pardew to guide Newcastle to their first European quarter-final in 8 years as they defeated Russian side [[FC_Anzhi_Makhachkala|Anzhi Makhachkala]] 1-0 on aggregate. On 14 April 2013, Pardew's Newcastle side lost 3-0 to Sunderland at [[St._James'_Park|St. James' Park]], Newcastle's biggest home defeat to Sunderland since [[Bill_McGarry_(footballer)|Bill McGarry]]'s side lost 4–1 in February 1979.

So far in his career, Pardew has been involved in several controversial issues and events. In 2003, the [[BBC|BBC]] described him as being a "dangerous and distant animal" in the media, referring to his public relations abilities, which has led him to making several rash comments.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Pards on the table| work = BBC Sport| accessdate =16 November 2007| date = 18 September 2003| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/3099788.stm| first=Stuart| last=Roach}}</ref> When at West Ham, the club employed a media advisor for Pardew to help him win over sceptical fans.<ref name="Guardian profile"/> The following is a list of controversies Pardew has been involved in:
*In September 2003, Pardew resigned from Reading after being refused permission to become manager at West Ham. Reading's chairman [[John_Madejski|John Madejski]] attempted to create an [[injunction|injunction]] in the [[High_Court_of_Justice|High Court]] to prevent him from moving to West Ham. Eventually Reading's legal action was dropped, and Pardew joined West Ham after a period of [[gardening_leave|gardening leave]].<ref name="Pardew free to join West Ham"/>
*In March 2006, Pardew had a dispute with [[Arsenal_F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Arsène_Wenger|Arsène Wenger]], after he criticised Arsenal for failing to field an English player in their [[UEFA_Champions_League|UEFA Champions League]] win against [[Real_Madrid_C.F.|Real Madrid]].<ref>{{Cite news| title = Pardew questions Arsenal policy| work = BBC Sport| accessdate =16 November 2007| date = 10 March 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4792270.stm}}</ref> Wenger suggested that Pardew was being xenophobic,<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4793868.stm| title = Dein backs Wenger foreign policy| work = BBC Sport| accessdate =16 November 2007| date = 11 March 2006}}</ref> a claim Pardew denied, citing his marriage to a [[Sweden|Swedish]] wife.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Pardew insists he is not a racist| work = BBC Sport| accessdate =16 November 2007| date = 13 March 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/4802644.stm}}</ref>

*In February 2007, shortly before Pardew's new club Charlton faced West Ham, ''[[The_Sun_(newspaper)|The Sun]]'' published a report documenting a video of one of Pardew's media training sessions he took whilst manager at West Ham. In the video, Pardew jokingly made several disparaging comments about West Ham's fans.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Pardew's 4-letter fan gag| work = The Sun| accessdate =16 November 2007| date = 24 February 2007| url = http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/article19476.ece| location=London| first=Tom| last=Wells}}</ref>

*On the opening day of the 2012–13 Premier League season against Tottenham Hotspur, Pardew pushed an official after an incident where the ball appeared to go over the touchline, but the referee deemed it to still be in play. Pardew later apologised, citing his behaviour as "ridiculous".
