== 早年 ==
阿布拉姆大约生于1698年，是{{le|洛贡|Logone-Birni}}（今[[喀麥隆|喀麥隆]][[極北區|極北區]][[洛貢-沙里州|洛貢-沙里州]]）一个酋长的儿子。他的父亲非常富有，拥有几个妻子和十九个儿子。后来，[[土耳其人|土耳其人]]入侵了他父亲的领地，并发生了一场激战。阿布拉姆的父亲输掉了这场战争，这导致阿布拉姆被绑架，并被送到了[[君士坦丁堡|君士坦丁堡]]。

阿布拉姆在[[奥斯曼帝国|奥斯曼帝国]]逗留了将近一年，为[[苏丹_(称谓)|苏丹]][[艾哈迈德三世|艾哈迈德三世]]的家庭服务。彼时，俄罗斯的外交官[[萨瓦·弗拉季斯拉维奇-卢古辛斯基|萨瓦·弗拉季斯拉维奇-卢古辛斯基]]正在为[[沙皇|沙皇]]的宫殿寻找一些“聪明的非洲小奴隶”。根据上级的指示，阿布拉姆被选中，并很快通过[[贿赂|贿赂]]从苏丹大臣的手中赎回了他。据悉，沙皇对阿布拉姆的智商和服役的潜力很是满意，把他带到了家中。

1705年阿布拉姆[[洗礼|受洗]]，他把这一天作为他的生日，因为他并不知道他出生的具体日期。

阿布拉姆重视他与他教父彼得大帝的关系，也重视与彼得大帝的女儿[[伊丽莎白·彼得罗芙娜·罗曼诺娃|伊丽莎白]]的关系，并对他们保持家庭一般的忠诚。自年轻的时候起，阿布拉姆就被皇帝带在身边，参与军事行动，并在军事行动中充当皇帝的[[近侍|近侍]]。
<!-- His origins are uncertain.  Early writings about Gannibal suggest he was born in 1696 in a village called "Lagon," the capital of a minor [[Ethiopia|Ethiopia]]n province, located "on the northern side of the [[Mareb_River|Mareb River]]..."<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Smith | first = Homer | title = Hannibal and Russian Arms | journal = Ethiopia Observer | volume = 6 | issue = July |year=1957}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | last = Troyat | first = Henri | title = Pushkin's Ethiopian Ancestry | journal = Ethiopia Observer | volume = 6 |year=1957}}</ref> (which serves as much of the modern border between Ethiopia and Eritrea). However, no such place has been identified in Ethiopia. He was rumored to be the 19th son of some lesser ruler or warlord. "As the other sons were brought to their father with their hands trussed up with a rope, he enjoyed freedom of the youngest son swimming in his father's fountains" (Pushkin's notes to [[Eugene_Onegin|Eugene Onegin]]). The research (1996) of [[Dieudonné_Gnammankou|Dieudonné Gnammankou]] suggests he may actually have been from what is now the [[Sultanate|Sultanate]] of [[Logone-Birni|Logone-Birni]] on the [[Logone_River|Logone River]], in [[Cameroon|Cameroon]], south of [[Lake_Chad|Lake Chad]]. In an official document that Gannibal submitted in 1742 to [[Empress_Elizabeth|Empress Elizabeth]], while petitioning for the rank of [[nobility|nobility]] and a [[coat_of_arms|coat of arms]], he asked for the right to use a family crest emblazoned with an elephant and the mysterious word "FVMMO". It means homeland in [[Kotoko|Kotoko]]. However, FVMMO has also been suggested to stand for the Latin expression "Fortuna Vitam Meam Mutavit Oppido" which means "Fortune has changed my life in the city".

At the age of seven (c. 1703) Gannibal was taken to the court of the [[Ottoman_Empire|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman_Dynasty|Sultan]] at [[Constantinople|Constantinople]]. Based on the year, the Sultan was either [[Mustafa_II|Mustafa II]] (reigned 1695–1703) or [[Ahmed_III|Ahmed III]] (reigned 1703–1730). The German biography of Gannibal, compiled anonymously from his own words, explains that "the children of the noble families were taken to the ruler of all the Muslims, the Turkish sultan, as hostages", to be killed or sold into [[slavery|slavery]] if their fathers misbehaved. Gannibal's sister Lahan was taken into captivity at the same time but died during the voyage.  See [[Arab_slave_trade|Arab slave trade]].

In 1704, after one year in the capital, Gannibal was taken away by the deputy of the Russian [[Ambassador_(diplomacy)|ambassador]] [[Sava_Vladislavich|Savva Raguzinsky]], who was following the orders of his superiors (one of whom was [[Pyotr_Andreyevich_Tolstoy|Pyotr Andreyevich Tolstoy]], great-grandfather of the great writer [[Leo_Tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]].) 

All of this was done by order of Peter the Great. Apparently, Gannibal wasn't the only "[[arap|arap]]" boy to be taken. It was fashionable at the time to have black children at the courts of European monarchs.

Gannibal was baptized in 1705, in [http://www.travelvilnius.com/index.php?id=Houses_of_Worship&lang=EN St. Paraskeva's Church] in [[Vilnius|Vilnius]], with Peter as his [[godfather|godfather]]. -->

== 教育 ==

<!-- In 1717, Gannibal was taken to [[Paris|Paris]] to continue an education in the arts, sciences and warfare. By then he was fluent in several languages and knew mathematics and geometry. He fought with the forces of [[Louis_XV_of_France|Louis XV of France]] against those of Louis' uncle [[Philip_V_of_Spain|Philip V of Spain]] and rose to the rank of captain. It was during his time in France that Gannibal adopted his surname in honor of the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] general [[Hannibal|Hannibal]] (''Gannibal'' being the traditional transliteration of the name in Russian). In Paris he met and befriended such [[Age_of_Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] figures as [[Denis_Diderot|Denis Diderot]], the [[Charles_de_Secondat,_baron_de_Montesquieu|Baron de Montesquieu]] and [[Voltaire|Voltaire]]. (This claim by his biographer [[Hugh_Barnes|Hugh Barnes]] is disputed by reviewer Andrew Kahn.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.powells.com/review/2005_10_02.html |title=Black Russian - A Review by Andrew Kahn of Hugh Barnes' ''Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg''. |access-date=2009-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061211161751/http://www.powells.com/review/2005_10_02.html |archive-date=2006-12-11 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>) Voltaire called Gannibal the "dark star of the Enlightenment".<ref>Barnes, Hugh. ''Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg'', London 2005, p. 4.</ref> -->
1717年，阿布拉姆被派往[[梅斯|梅斯]]接受艺术、科学与军事学教育。在那里，他熟练地掌握了几门语言，并精通数学与[[几何学|几何学]]。1718年，阿拉巴姆加入了法国军队，希望通过展现他在军事工程学上的学习成果，取悦他的[[彼得大帝|教父]]。1720年，他被[[拉费尔|拉费尔]]的皇家炮兵学院录取。

在阿布拉姆的学习期间，[[法国|法国]]与[[西班牙|西班牙]]爆发了冲突。在[[四国同盟战争|四国同盟战争]]中，他为法军而战，并升至队长。在法国对西班牙的战争中，阿布拉姆头部受伤并被西班牙军队俘虏。他于1722年得到释放，并前往梅斯继续他的学业。

在法国时，阿布拉姆将汉尼拔作为他的姓，以此纪念[[迦太基|迦太基]]名将[[汉尼拔|汉尼拔]]。在[[巴黎|巴黎]]，他结识了[[启蒙时代|启蒙时代]]的重要人物，诸如[[孟德斯鸠|孟德斯鸠]]与[[伏尔泰|伏尔泰]]。伏尔泰称他为“启蒙时代的暗星”。

之后几年，汉尼拔回到了俄罗斯。这段深造经历使他成功地得到了工程师的岗位，随后成为了沙皇御用卫队的数学导师。

<!-- Gannibal's education was completed by 1722 and he was due to return to Russia. He wrote to Peter and begged for permission to return to Russia by land, not sea. It is rumored that he was met on his return by Peter himself, a few kilometers away from [[Moscow|Moscow]].

After the death of Peter in 1725, Gannibal was exiled to [[Siberia|Siberia]] in 1727, some 4,000 miles to the east of [[Saint_Petersburg|Saint Petersburg]]. He was pardoned in 1730 for his skills in military engineering. After Peter's daughter [[Elizabeth_of_Russia|Elizabeth]] became the new monarch in 1741, he became a prominent person at her court, rose to the rank of major-general and became governor of Reval (now [[Tallinn|Tallinn]], [[Estonia|Estonia]]) a position he held from 1742 to 1752. A letter signed on March 22, 1744 by "A. Ganibal" (note only one 'n') has been photographed at the Tallinn City Archive, see photo. The Empress Elizabeth had in 1742 given him the Mikhailovskoye estate in [[Pskov|Pskov]] province with hundreds of [[serfdom|serfs]].<ref>Gnammankou, Dieudonné. ''Abraham Hanibal - l’aïeul noir de Pouchkine'', Paris 1996, p. 129.</ref><ref>Barnes, Hugh. ''Gannibal: The Moor of Petersburg'', London 2005, p. 219.</ref> Here, he retired in 1762.

It is rumored that the great general [[Alexander_Suvorov|Alexander Suvorov]] owed his life as a soldier to Gannibal, who convinced Suvorov's father to let his son pursue a military career.-->

== 家庭 ==

<!-- Gannibal married twice. His first wife was Evdokia Dioper, a [[Greeks|Greek]] woman. The couple married in 1731 and had one daughter. Unfortunately Dioper despised her husband, whom she was [[forced_marriage|forced to marry]]. When Gannibal found out that she had been unfaithful to him, he had her arrested and thrown into prison, where she spent eleven years living in terrible conditions. Gannibal began living with another woman, Christina Regina Siöberg (1705–1781), daughter of Mattias Johan Siöberg and wife Christina Elisabeth d'Albedyll, and married her in Reval, in 1736, a year after the birth of their first child and while still [[bigamy|bigamously]] married to his first wife. The divorce from Dioper would not become final until 1753, upon which a fine and a penance were imposed on Gannibal, and Dioper was sent to a convent for the rest of her life. Gannibal's second marriage was nevertheless deemed legal.  -->

<!-- On her paternal side, Gannibal’s second wife descended from noble families in [[Scandinavia|Scandinavia]] and [[Germany|Germany]]: Siöberg ([[Sweden|Sweden]]), Galtung ([[Norway|Norway]]) and Grabow ([[Denmark|Denmark]] and [[Margraviate_of_Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]).<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Лихауг [Lihaug] | first = Э.

Abram Gannibal and Christina Regina Siöberg had ten children, including a son, Osip. Osip in turn would have a daughter, Nadezhda, the mother of [[Aleksandr_Pushkin|Aleksandr Pushkin]]. Gannibal's oldest son, Ivan, became an accomplished naval officer who founded the city of [[Kherson|Kherson]] in 1779 and attained the rank of [[General-in-Chief|General-in-Chief]], the [[Russian_military_ranks#1722-1917|second highest military rank]] in [[Russian_Empire|imperial Russia]].

It should also be noted that some British aristocrats descend from Gannibal, such as [[Natalia_Grosvenor,_Duchess_of_Westminster|Natalia Grosvenor, Duchess of Westminster]], and [[George_Mountbatten,_4th_Marquess_of_Milford_Haven|George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven]]. <ref>[http://www.genealogics.org/register.php?personID=I00068794&tree=LEO&generations=6 Abraham Petrovich Hanibal's descendants at Genealogics.org]</ref><ref>[http://www.genealogics.org/register.php?personID=I00068783&tree=LEO&generations=6 Aleksander Sergeevich Pushkin's descendants at Genealogics.org]</ref> -->
