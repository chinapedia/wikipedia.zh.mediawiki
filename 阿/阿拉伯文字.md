'''阿拉伯文字'''是一种用于书写[[阿拉伯语|阿拉伯语]]、[[曼丁哥语|曼丁哥语方言]]、[[中库尔德语|中库尔德语]]、[[Luri|Luri]]、[[波斯语|波斯语]]、[[乌尔都语|乌尔都语]]、[[普什图语|普什图语]]及其他亚非语言的[[书写系统|书写系统]]。<ref>Mahinnaz Mirdehghan. 2010.

阿拉伯文字以[[手写体|手写体]]方式右起横书。其字母多数情况下表示辅音或者有少数元音的辅音，因此多数阿拉伯文字母表为[[辅音音素文字|辅音音素文字]]。

阿拉伯文字最初用于书写阿拉伯语，尤其是用于[[伊斯兰教|伊斯兰教]]经典《[[古兰经|古兰经]]》。随着伊斯兰教的传播被用于书写多个语族的语言，产生了新的字母和其他符号，在[[库尔德语字母#Sorani_alphabet|库尔德语]]、[[老维文|维吾尔语]]及古代[[Arebica|波斯尼亚文]]成为[[元音附标文字|元音附标文字]]或者[[全音素文字|全音素文字]]。阿拉伯文字也是[[伊斯兰书法|阿拉伯书法]]的基础。

The Arabic script has been adopted for use in a wide variety of languages besides Arabic, including [[Persian_language|Persian]], [[Malay_language|Malay]] and [[Urdu_language|Urdu]] which are not [[Semitic_languages|Semitic]]. Such adaptations may feature altered or new characters to represent [[phoneme|phoneme]]s that do not appear in Arabic [[phonology|phonology]]. For example, the Arabic language lacks a [[voiceless_bilabial_plosive|voiceless bilabial plosive]] (the {{IPA|[p]}} sound), so many languages add their own letter to represent {{IPA|[p]}} in the script, though the specific letter used varies from language to language. These modifications tend to fall into groups: all the [[India|India]]n and [[Turkic_languages|Turkic languages]] written in the Arabic script tend to use the [[Persian_alphabet|Persian modified letters]], whereas the [[languages_of_Indonesia|languages of Indonesia]] tend to imitate those of [[Jawi_(script)|Jawi]]. The modified version of the Arabic script originally devised for use with Persian is known as the [[Persian_alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] by scholars.

In the cases of [[Bosnian_language|Bosnian]],  [[Kurdish_languages|Kurdish]], [[Kashmiri_language|Kashmiri]], and [[Uyghur_language|Uyghur]] [[writing_system|writing system]]s, vowels are mandatory. The Arabic script can therefore be used in both [[abugida|abugida]] and [[abjad|abjad]], although it is often  strongly, erroneously connected to the latter.

Use of the Arabic script in [[West_Africa|West Africa]]n languages, especially in the [[Sahel|Sahel]], developed with the spread of [[Islam|Islam]]. To a certain degree the style and usage tends to follow those of the [[Maghreb|Maghreb]] (for instance the position of the dots in the letters ''[[Pe_(letter)|{{transl]]'' and ''[[Qoph|{{transl]]''). Additional diacritics have come into use to facilitate writing of sounds not represented in the Arabic language. The term ''[[Ajami_script|{{transl]]'', which comes from the Arabic root for "foreign," has been applied to Arabic-based orthographies of African languages.

===Languages currently written with the Arabic alphabet===
Today Afghanistan, Iran, India, Pakistan and China are the main non-Arabic speaking states using the Arabic alphabet to write one or more official national languages, including [[Baluchi_language|Baluchi]], [[Brahui_language|Brahui]], [[Persian_language|Persian]], [[Pashto_language|Pashto]], [[Central_Kurdish|Central Kurdish]], [[Urdu_language|Urdu]], [[Sindhi_language|Sindhi]], [[Kashmiri_language|Kashmiri]], [[Punjabi_language|Punjabi]] and [[Uyghur_language|Uyghur]].

There is evidence that writing Arabic in this other set of letters (known as Garshuni) influenced the style of modern Arabic script. After this initial period, Garshuni writing has continued to the present day among some [[Assyrian_people|Syriac]] Christian communities in the Arabic-speaking regions of the [[Levant|Levant]] and [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]].

=== Languages formerly written with the Arabic alphabet ===
Speakers of languages that were previously unwritten used Arabic script as a basis to design writing systems for their mother languages. This choice could be influenced by Arabic being their second language, the language of scripture of their faith, or the only written language they came in contact with. Additionally, since most education was once religious, choice of script was determined by the writer's religion; which meant that Muslims would use Arabic script to write whatever language they spoke. This led to Arabic script being the most widely used script during the Middle Ages.

In the 20th century, the Arabic script was generally replaced by the [[Latin_alphabet|Latin alphabet]] in the [[Balkans|Balkans]],{{dubious|date=November 2011}} parts of [[Sub-Saharan_Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa]], and [[Southeast_Asia|Southeast Asia]],
while in the [[Soviet_Union|Soviet Union]], after a brief period of [[Latinisation_(USSR)|Latinisation]],<ref>[http://www.azer.com/aiweb/categories/magazine/52_folder/52_articles/52_alphabet.html Alphabet Transitions – The Latin Script: A New Chronology – Symbol of a New Azerbaijan], by Tamam Bayatly</ref> use of [[Cyrillic_script|Cyrillic]] was mandated. [[Turkey|Turkey]] changed to the Latin alphabet in 1928 as part of an internal Westernizing revolution. After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, many of the Turkic languages of the ex-USSR attempted to follow Turkey's lead and convert to a Turkish-style Latin alphabet. However, renewed use of the Arabic alphabet has occurred to a limited extent in [[Tajikistan|Tajikistan]], whose language's close resemblance to [[Persian_language|Persian]] allows direct use of publications from Iran.<ref>[http://www.cimera.org/files/camel/en/27e/MICA27E-Siddikzoda.pdf Tajik Language: Farsi or Not Farsi?] {{wayback|url=http://www.cimera.org/files/camel/en/27e/MICA27E-Siddikzoda.pdf |date=20060613000000 }} by Sukhail Siddikzoda, reporter, Tajikistan.</ref>

Most languages of the [[Iranian_languages|Iranian languages]] family continue to use Arabic script, as well as the [[Indo-Aryan_languages|Indo-Aryan languages]] of Pakistan and of Muslim populations in [[India|India]], but the [[Bengali_language|Bengali language]] of Bangladesh is written in the [[Bengali_alphabet|Bengali alphabet]].

* For the West African languages—[[Hausa_language|Hausa]], [[Fula_language|Fula]], [[Mandinka_language|Mandinka]], [[Wolof_language|Wolof]] and some more—the Latin alphabet has officially replaced Arabic transcriptions for use in literacy and education;
* [[Malagasy_language|Malagasy]] in [[Madagascar|Madagascar]] (script known as [[Sorabe_alphabet|Sorabe]]);

* [[Swahili_language|Swahili]] (has used the [[Latin_alphabet|Latin alphabet]] since the 19th century);
* [[Yoruba_language|Yoruba]] in West Africa (this was probably limited, but still notable)

====Europe====
