'''固体化学'''是研究固体结构、性质、合成、表征等的一门化学分支，它综合了[[固体物理学|固体物理学]]、[[矿物学|矿物学]]、[[晶体学|晶体学]]、[[冶金学|冶金学]]、[[材料科学|材料科学]]等多个学科的知识。

==历史==
固体无机化学与商业产品联系紧密。工业需求与技术发展构成了固体化学发展的主要动力。20世纪材料化学在工业领域有着多项应用，例子包括：50年代用于石油催化裂解的[[沸石|沸石]]分子筛与[[铂|铂]]金属催化剂、60年代为微电子信息技术作出重要贡献的高纯硅以及80年代的高温超导体。20世纪初发明的[[X射线晶体学|X射线晶体衍射]]对材料化学的发展有重要帮助。[[卡尔·瓦格纳|卡尔·瓦格纳]]在氧化速率理论方面、离子反向扩散与缺陷化学方面的贡献使人们在原子层面上对化学反应有了更深入的了解。他也因此被称为“固体化学之父”。<ref>, 参考 Pierre Teissier, ''L’émergence de la chimie du solide en France (1950-2000).

==合成方法==
固体材料种类繁多，因而有着各种各样的合成方法。对于有机材料来说，合成在室温附近进行，基本操作与一般的[[有机合成|有机合成]]类似。氧化还原反应有时通过电结晶过程来完成，例如从[[四硫富瓦烯|四硫富瓦烯]]合成[[Bechgaard盐|Bechgaard盐]]。

===高温反应法===
对热稳定的材料来说，常用的方法是高温方法。例如，大块的固体常用{{lang-en|管式炉|tube furnace}}制备，其反应温度可达约 1100 °C。以通有电流的钽管作为反应装置，可以实现在约 2000°C下的反应。这样高的温度有利于反应物的扩散，但是具体条件仍需综合考虑反应体系决定。事实上已经有一些固相反应可以在低至100°C的温度下进行。

====熔体反应法====
一种经常用到的方法是将反应物共熔然后进行退火。如体系中有挥发性的反应物，常将反应物在液氮冷却下装入真空安瓿瓶中，之后进行熔封，并加热反应。

====溶液合成法====
固体可以通过沉淀或蒸发溶剂的方法从溶液里得到。这包括溶剂热合成法，即在高压下在高于正常沸点的溶剂中发生反应。另一种形式是在固体反应物中加入少量的低熔点物质，该物质在高温下熔化并作为体系中的溶剂。

====气相反应====
====Gas reactions====
Many solids react readily with reactive gas species like chlorine, iodine, oxygen etc. Others form [[加合物|adduct]]s with other gases, e.g. CO or ethylene. Such reactions are often carried out in a tube that is open ended on both sides and through which the gas is passed. A variation of this is to let the reaction take place inside a measuring device such as a [[thermogravimetric_analysis|TGA]]. In that case stoichiometric information can be obtained during the reaction, which helps identify the products.

A special case of a gas reaction is a [[chemical_transport_reaction|chemical transport reaction]]. These are often carried out in a sealed ampoule to with a small amount of a transport agent, e.g. iodine is added. The ampoule is then placed in a zone oven. This is essentially two tube ovens attached to each other which allows a temperature grandient to be imposed. Such a method can be used to obtain the product in the form of single crystals suitable for structure determination by X-ray diffraction.

[[化学气相沉积|Chemical vapor deposition]] is a high temperature method that is widely employed for the

===Air and moisture sensitive materials===
Many solids are [[hygroscopic|hygroscopic]] and/or oxygen sensitive. Many [[卤化物|halide]]s e.g. are very 'thirsty' and can only be studied in their anhydrous form if they are handled in a glove box filled with dry (and/or oxygen-free) gas, usually [[氮|nitrogen]].

==Characterization==
===New phases, phase diagrams, structures===
The synthetic methodology and the characterization of the product often go hand in hand in the sense that not one but a series of reaction mixtures are prepared and subjected to heat treatment. The stoichiometry is typically ''varied'' in a systematic way to find which stoichiometries will lead to new solid compounds or to solid solutions between known ones. A prime method to characterize the reaction products is [[powder_diffraction|powder diffraction]], because many solid state reactions will produce polycristalline ingots or powders. Powder diffraction will facilitate the identification of known phases in the mixture. If a pattern is found that is not known in the diffraction data libraries an attempt can be made to index the pattern, i.e. to identify the symmetry and the size of the unit cell. (If the product is not crystalline the characterization is typically much more difficult.)

Once the unit cell of a new phase is known, the next step is to establish the stoichiometry of the phase. This can be done in a number of ways. Sometimes the composition of the original mixture will give a clue, if one finds only one product -a single powder pattern- or if one was trying to make a phase of a certain composition by analogy to known materials but this is rare.
Often considerable effort in refining the synthetic methodology is required to obtain a pure sample of the new material.
If it is possible to separate the product from the rest of the reaction mixture elemental analysis can be used. Another ways involves [[Scanning_electron_microscopy|SEM]] and the generation of characteristic X-rays in the electron beam. The easiest way is to solve the structure is by using single crystal X-ray diffraction.

The latter often requires ''revisiting'' and refining the preparative procedures and that is linked to the question which phases are stable at what composition and what stoichiometry. In other words what does the [[相图|phase diagram]] looks like.<ref>cf. Chapter 12 of Elements of X-ray diffraction, B.D. Cullity, Addison-Wesley, 2nd ed. 1977 ISBN 0-201-01174-3</ref> An important tool in establishing this is [[thermal_analysis|thermal analysis]] techniques like [[Differential_scanning_calorimetry|DSC]] or [[Differential_thermal_analysis|DTA]] and increasingly also, thanks to the advent of [[同步加速器|synchrotron]]s temperature-dependent power diffraction. Increased knowledge of the phase relations often leads to further refinement in synthetic procedures in an iterative way. New phases are thus characterized by their melting points and their stoichiometric domains. The latter is important for the many solids that are non-stoichiometric compounds. The cell parameters obtained from XRD are particularly helpful to characterize the homogeneity ranges of the latter.

===Further characterization===
In many -but certainly not all- cases new solid compounds are further characterized<ref>cf. Chapter 2 of ''New directions in Solid State Chemistry''. C.N.R. Rao and J. Gopalakrishnan. Cambridge U. Press 1997 ISBN 0-521-49559-8</ref> by a variety of techniques that straddle the fine line that (hardly) separates solid-state chemistry from solid-state physics.

====Optical properties====
For non-metallic materials it is often possible to obtain UV/VIS spectra. In the case of semiconductors that will give an idea of the band gap.

====Electrical properties====
Four-point (or five-point) probe methods are often applied either to ingots, crystals or pressed pellets to measure resistivity and the size of the [[霍爾效應|Hall effect]]. This gives information on whether the compound is an [[絕緣體|insulator]], [[半导体|semiconductor]], [[semimetal|semimetal]] or [[金属|metal]] and upon the type of [[Doping_(semiconductor)|doping]] and the mobility in the delocalized bands (if present). Thus important information is obtained on the chemical bonding in the material.

====Magnetic properties====
Magnetic susceptibility can be measured as function of temperature to establish whether the material is a [[順磁性|para-]], [[铁磁性|ferro-]] or [[反铁磁性|antiferro-]] magnet. Again the information obtained pertains to the bonding in the material. This is particularly important for transition metal compounds. In the case of magnetic order [[中子衍射技术|neutron diffraction]] can be used to determine the [[magnetic_structure|magnetic structure]].
