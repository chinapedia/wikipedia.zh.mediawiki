when引出的时间状语从句，其中的动词既可以是'''延续性动作'''的动词，也可以是'''瞬间性动作'''的动词，而且可以表示主语的动作和从句的动作'''同时发生'''，或者从句的动作发生在主句的动作之前。

e.g.

   When you apply for a job, you must present your credentials.

   When the students heard the teacher's footsteps, they all stopped talking.

when还可以表示just then(正在那时，突然)的意思，此时其所引导的从句只放在主句之后。

as引出的时间状语从句，其动作是'''延续性'''的，而且侧重表示主句和从句的动作'''同时发生'''.

===whenever,every time,each time任何时候;每当===

e.g.

before引导的从句一般表示主句的动作发生在'''从句动作之前'''，如'''从句'''是'''过去时''','''主句'''一般用'''过去完成时'''.

until比较正式，可'''用于句首'''，而till一般'''不用于句首'''.till和until所表示的意义相同，但要'''注意'''以下情况:

如主句的谓语动词是'''延续性动词'''，就常用'''肯定式'''表示"直到...为止"

   He will remain in college until(till) he finishes his Ph.D course.

如主句的谓语动词是'''非延续性动词'''，就常用'''否定式'''表示"直到...才"或"在...之前（不）".此时的till和still可用'''before'''替换，意义差别不大。

e.g.

   I won't go with you until(till) I finish my homework.

===as soon as,immediately,directly,once,the minute/moment (that) etc.===

as soon as,immediately,directly,once,the minute/moment (that)等引导的从句都表示从句的动作一发生，主句的动作'''随即就发生'''，常译为"一...就...".
