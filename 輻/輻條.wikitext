[[Image:Bicycle_wheel.jpg|right]]的金屬輻條]]
'''輻條'''是从[[車輪|車輪]]中心的轮毂（即与[[轴|轴]]相连的地方）辐射出来的杆、条等，它把轮毂和圆形的轮圈连接起来。

==历史==
辐条[[轮|轮]]的出现使车辆更加轻便。辐条最早出现在公元前2000年的[[安德罗诺沃文化|安德罗诺沃文化]]中。不久之后，[[高加索|高加索]]地区的游牧民族就使用了装有辐条轮的[[马战车|马战车]]，持续将近三个世纪。他们随后开始迁移，深入希腊半岛，与当地的地中海民族汇合，在[[米诺斯文明|米诺斯文明]]消亡之后建立了[[古典希腊时期|古典希腊]]（后被[[斯巴达|斯巴达]]吞并）。[[凯尔特人|凯尔特人]]则在公元前几百年就在战车车轮外加上了铁圈。这种辐条轮一直沿用至1870年代，这时钢丝轮和橡胶[[轮胎|轮胎]]问世了。<ref name="Herlihy">{{cite book

==类型==
辐条的材质可以是木头、金属、合成纤维等，这取决于辐条是[[张力|受拉]]还是[[压力|受压]]。
===压缩辐条===
木质辐条轮最早用于[[马车|马车]]和马拉的货车。早期的机动车用的通常是装在炮架上的木质辐条轮。

简易的木质轮轮毂受压时，轮圈靠近地面的地方会略有凹陷，最低的一根木质辐条因受压而变短，而其他的辐条则没有明显变化。

木质辐条常沿[[半径|半径]]方向安装，同时呈向外的碟形，以避免车辆摇晃。通过增加碟形的程度还能抵消辐条因受潮而产生的膨胀。<ref name="Hansen">{{cite web

===张力辐条===
[[自行车|自行车]]的车轮不是笨重的木质辐条轮，而是{{link-en|钢丝轮|wire wheels}}。这种车轮更加轻便，它的辐条是拉紧但可调节的金属丝。[[轮椅|轮椅]]、[[摩托车|摩托车]]、[[汽车|汽车]]也用这种车轮。
====类型====
有些车轮的辐条可以一根根取下，若有弯曲或折断便能更换。自行车和轮椅车轮的辐条就是这样。质量高的自行车所配的常规车轮用的是不锈钢辐条，而比较便宜的自行车用的是镀[[锌|锌]]或镀[[铬|铬]]的辐条。高质量的辐条可承受225[[千克力|千克力]]，不过实际使用时负载只有它的几分之一以避免[[金屬疲勞|疲劳损坏]]。因为自行车和轮椅的辐条只会处于拉伸状态，其材质也可以是柔韧性强的材料（如[[合成纤维|合成纤维]]）。<ref name="spinergy">{{cite web

====对负载的反应====
当编得很好的钢丝辐条轮承受径向负载（如车手坐在自行车上）时，车轮与地面接触处附近会略有凹陷，其余部分则基本保持圆形。<ref name=Forester>{{cite journal

虽然钢丝轮的辐条又细又柔韧，但沿半径方向却是刚性的，所以辐条的悬挂随动与高压自行车轮胎相比都不值一提。

| quote = Radial Stiffness:  There's almost -no- vertical compliance in your wheel and people who insist that they can feel the vertical stiffness or “harshness” of a wheel are mistaken.  The radial stiffness of a bicycle wheel is ~ 3-4000 N/mm.  This equals a deflection of 0.1 mm under a 40 kg load.  Sorry princess, but that gets obscured by the amount of deflection in the tires, fork, saddle, handlebar tape, frame, and even your gloves.

| quote = A radially spoked wheel is about 4.6% stiffer than a tangentially spoked one. Alternatively, if you apply 1000N (about 100kg, 220lb) to each of the wheels, the tangential (four-cross) spoked one deflects 0.0075mm (0.0003 inch) more than the radial spoked. Since the tyre is likely to deflect several millimetres at least (if 3mm, that's 400 times more deflection) I conclude the spoking is unlikely to make a discernible difference to the vertical stiffness of the wheel.

| quote = There is no change in radial elasticity between a radial and crossed spoke wheel with the same components, other than the length of the spokes. A 290 mm spoke is 3% stiffer than a 300 mm spoke of the same type. Since spokes stretch elastically about 0.1mm on a hard bump (not ordinary road ripples), the elastic difference between the radial and cross-three wheel is 3% x 0.1mm = 0.003 mm. Copier paper is 0.075 mm thick, and if you can feel that when you ride over it on a glassy smooth concrete surface, please let me know. You have greater sensitivity than the lady in "the princess and the pea" fable.
