<!--==劇情==
While attemptin to destroy the Tree of Blight, Finn is accidentally hugged by a wolf-like creature. Later that night, after he begins to show signs of a fever, as well as a new-found penchant for hugging, Jake urges Finn to get some sleep. Ominously, in the morning, while walking through the Candy Kingdom, several citizens reveal that Finn appeared before them during the night and aggressively hugged them.

Finn and Jake journey to the library and read about the "hugwolf", a [[lycanthrope|lycanthropic]] creature that turns into a wolf in the presence of a [[full_moon|full moon]] and hugs its victims. The curse is spread from higher-level "alpha" hugwolves, to lower-lever "beta" creatures, of which Finn is now. That night, Jake and BMO try to restrain Finn, but he breaks free and goes on a hugging spree in the Candy Kingdom.

The next morning, the citizens of the kingdom imprison Finn in the dungeon. Jake in turn leads an angry mob in search of the alpha hugwolf. Due to a mishap by Cinnamon Bun, Finn escapes and transforms. Meanwhile, the alpha creature corners Jake and his mob, but Finn shows up. Finn and the alpha wolf start hugging each other, which seems to act as a cure for the condition. Finn is returned to his former state, as is the alpha, who is revealed to be a beautiful woman. The episode ends with the woman turning into the Tree of Blight.

"Hug Wolf" was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Hug Wolf| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Somvilay Xayaphone & Bert Youn (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=May 14, 2012| season = 4 | number = 8}}</ref> The episode came together after Ward drew several werewolf-inspired creatures with a fondness for hugging. He felt that the resulting story would be humorous, and the episode came into being. In addition, Ward himself voiced the father of the gumdrop girl Finn almost attacks during one of his hugging sprees. All of the lines were [[improvise|improvise]]d while Ward was in the recording booth.<ref name=wardhug>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014. "Hug Wolf" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref>

The music that accompanies the climactic showdown between Finn and the Alpha Hugwolf was composed by Casey James Basichis. The composer thought up several novel ways to convey Finn's transformation through music, including "burying 8bit [[Nintendo_Entertainment_System|NES]] synths in distortion, playing guitar with my girlfriend’s many [[fur_coat|fur coat]]s, [and] screaming into pillows".<ref name=howlsong/> He eventually settled on using fur coats to produce a "warm, woolly" sound. The music's beat was crafted to sound like "unrelenting static electricity".<ref name=howlsong>{{cite web|last1=Basichis|first1=Casey James|title=To Howl and to Hug|url=http://nastysonix.com/post/23127628062/to-howl-and-to-hug-im-really-excited-to|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=September 1, 2014|date=May 15, 2012}}</ref>

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "B+", arguing that the episode was an analogy for the more serious topic of [[rape|rape]]. He concluded that, "There’s no significant world building or a talking snail cliff hanger, but 'Hug Wolf' is a bizarre, clever episode with some great one-liners and visual gags. It’s not as madcap as some episodes, but it mines its central concept for all it can, squeezing out as much humor as possible from a hug-rape story."<ref name=avclubhug>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Adventure Time: 'Hug Wolf'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-hug-wolf-73635|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
