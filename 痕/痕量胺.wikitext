'''痕量胺'''（英文：'''Trace amine'''）是一类与经典的[[生物胺|生物胺]]（如[[儿茶酚胺|儿茶酚胺]]类、[[血清素|血清素]]、[[组胺|组胺]]）结构类似的内源性物质，包括p-[[酪胺|酪胺]]、β-[[苯乙胺|苯乙胺]]、[[色胺|色胺]]、[[章胺|章胺]]和[[类甲腺质|类甲腺质]]，存在于动物（昆虫至哺乳动物）的神经系统中。痕量胺屬於{{le|TAAR1|TAAR1}}激動劑<ref name="pmid22038157">{{cite journal |vauthors=Panas MW, Xie Z, Panas HN, Hoener MC, Vallender EJ, Miller GM | title = Trace amine associated receptor 1 signaling in activated lymphocytes | journal = J Neuroimmune Pharmacol | volume = 7 | issue = 4 | pages = 866–76 |date=December 2012  | pmid = 22038157 | pmc = 3593117 | doi = 10.1007/s11481-011-9321-4 | quote = Trace Amine Associated Receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) that responds to a wide spectrum of agonists, including endogenous trace amines, ...}}</ref>，因此也是单胺能[[神經調節|神经调节剂]]<ref name="Burchett">{{cite journal |vauthors=Burchett SA, Hicks TP | title = The mysterious trace amines: protean neuromodulators of synaptic transmission in mammalian brain | journal = Prog.

PE has been shown to induce hyperactivity and aggression, two of the cardinal clinical features of ADHD, in experimental animals [100]. Hyperactivity is also a symptom of phenylketonuria, which as discussed above is associated with a markedly elevated PE turnover [44]. Further, amphetamines, which have clinical utility in ADHD, are good ligands at trace amine receptors [2]. Of possible relevance in this aspect is modafanil, which has shown beneficial effects in ADHD patients [101] and has been reported to enhance the activity of PE at TAAR1 [102]. Conversely, methylphenidate, which is also clinically useful in ADHD, showed poor efficacy at the TAAR1 receptor [2]. In this respect it is worth noting that the enhancement of functioning at TAAR1 seen with modafanil was not a result of a direct interaction with TAAR1 [102].<br />More direct evidence has been obtained recently for a role of trace amines in ADHD. Urinary PE levels have been reported to be decreased in ADHD patients in comparison to both controls and patients with autism [103-105]. Evidence for a decrease in PE levels in the brain of ADHD patients has also recently been reported [4]. In addition, decreases in the urine and plasma levels of the PE metabolite phenylacetic acid and the precursors phenylalanine and tyrosine have been reported along with decreases in plasma tyramine [103]. Following treatment with methylphenidate, patients who responded positively showed a normalization of urinary PE, whilst non-responders showed no change from baseline values [105].}}</ref><ref name="Renaissance GPCR">{{cite journal |vauthors=Lindemann L, Hoener MC |title=A renaissance in trace amines inspired by a novel GPCR family |journal=Trends Pharmacol.

In this article, we focus on the relevance of TAs and their receptors to nervous system-related disorders, namely schizophrenia and depression; however, TAs have also been linked to other diseases such as migraine, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, substance abuse and eating disorders [7,8,36]. Clinical studies report increased β-PEA plasma levels in patients suffering from acute schizophrenia [37] and elevated urinary excretion of β-PEA in paranoid schizophrenics [38], which supports a role of TAs in schizophrenia. As a result of these studies, β-PEA has been referred to as the body’s ‘endogenous amphetamine’ [39]}}</ref>，在結構及機能上類似[[单胺类神经递质|单胺类神经递质]]<ref name="Vascular">{{cite journal | author = Broadley KJ | title = The vascular effects of trace amines and amphetamines | journal = Pharmacol.
