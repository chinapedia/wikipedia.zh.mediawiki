'''东加拿大狼'''是在1970年代辨識出來的新品種，但直到1999年才進行[[基因|基因]]確認。曾有許多種名稱，包括：'''東部狼'''、'''東部灰狼'''和'''阿爾岡金狼'''（Algonquin）等等，但最廣為接受的是東加拿大狼。其他名只被視為同义詞。
<!-- The '''Eastern Canadian Wolf''', ''Canis lycaon'', is a newly recognized [[wolf|wolf]] species identified as early as [[1970|1970]], but was not genetically confirmed until 1999. Many names were proposed, including the Eastern Wolf, Eastern Gray Wolf, and Algonquin Wolf, although Eastern Canadian Wolf has appeared to gain the most recognition. The other names are still recognized as [[synonym|synonym]]s. -->

== 目前消息 ==
現在許多此物種的發現被許多國際和政府組織研究中，因這個發現是最近發生的事，所以關於此的知識基礎仍被質疑。由於[[保育團體|保育團體]]給予的龐大壓力，安大略自然资源部發佈了對[[阿爾岡金省立公園|阿爾岡金省立公園]]附近狼群的禁獵令。但生物學家指出，近來的證據顯示狼群從公園邊界遷入遷出，使牠們成為獵人與農夫跟設陷阱最容易捕獲的獵物，這項證據導出了在維持健康的东加拿大狼群系統來說，此公園的範圍並不夠廣大。

== 身體特徵 ==
<!-- The Eastern Canadian Wolf is smaller than the [[Gray_Wolf|Gray Wolf]].  -->
東加拿大狼體型較[[灰狼|灰狼]]小，
<!-- It has a pale [[grey|grey]]ish-[[brown|brown]] [[pelt|pelt]]. The back and the sides are covered with long, [[black|black]] [[hair|hair]]s. Behind the [[ear|ear]]s, there is a slight [[red|red]]dish colour. These differences in attributes are thought to be a result of their [[Red_Wolf|Red Wolf]] [[ancestry|ancestry]].  -->
因為紅狼祖先的關係在耳後稍微帶有紅色。
<!-- The Algonquin wolf is also skinnier than the [[Grey_Wolf|Grey Wolf]] and displays a coyote-like appearance. -->
比灰狼瘦且長得像土狼，
<!-- This is because wolves and coyotes often mate and breed hybrid wolf/coyote pups in the park. -->
這是因為常與土狼混血的結果。
<!-- The Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society states: "Hybridization with coyotes has historically been a precursor to the decline of Eastern wolf populations. The Committee on the Status of Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) has identified hybridization with coyotes as one of the major threats facing the Eastern wolf, and hybridization continues to pose a serious challenge to red wolf recovery efforts in North Carolina." Because the two animals looks so much alike, a van on the hunting of Algonquin wolves and coyotes has been in place to make sure no accidental deathes occur.

Grey wolves will attack, kill or drive out coyotes if they find them, but recent studies by John and Mary Theberge suggest that Algonquin red wolf males mate and accept coyote females. John Theberge states that, because coyotes are smaller than wolves, that female wolves would be less likely to accept a smaller mate. -->
灰狼會殺掉或驅離牠們找到的土狼，
但 John Theberge 與 Mary Theberge 晚近的研究指出，阿爾岡金紅狼的雄性會接受雌性土狼。John Theberge 指出，因為土狼比狼小，因此雌狼不太會接受比較小的對象。

== 分佈 ==
<!-- The Eastern Canadian Wolf mainly occupies the area around [[Algonquin_Park|Algonquin Park]] in [[Canada|Canada]]. It is suspected that the species is also present in [[Minnesota|Minnesota]], [[Manitoba|Manitoba]], and [[Quebec|Quebec]]. It is also suspected that the range used to stretch as far south as [[Florida|Florida]], but as [[drought|drought]] and other geographical barriers developed, the Eastern Canadian Wolf and the Red Wolf were separated and [[speciation|speciation]] occurred. Both species suffered heavy persecution since the arrival of [[Europe|Europe]]ans, leading to eventual [[extinction|extinction]] in the [[United_States|United States]]. In Canada, exact numbers of Eastern Canadian Wolves are unknown.

Because wolves disperse from their packs and travel great distances to find mates, this has made it harder for biologists to protect them. Algonquin wolves will anf often do travel out of the park, where they are protected, and into places that do not welcome wolves such as farm country. Infact, most wolf deathes occur outside the park: "Of all the wolf deaths recorded from 1988 to 1999, a minimum of 66% was caused by humans. Shooting and snaring outside park boundaries were the leading causes of death for wolves radio-collared in Algonquin Park. References: ." One wolf that was radio-collared in July 1992 was located in October in Gatineau Park (north of Ottawa), which is 170 km from Algonquin Park. By mid-December it had made its way back to Algonquin ,and then, in March 1993, this wolf's severed head nailed to a telephone poll in Round Lake by someone who hated wolves. -->
主要分佈在[[加拿大|加拿大]][[阿爾岡金省立公園|阿爾岡金省立公園]]，推測也出現在[[明尼蘇達州|明尼蘇達州]]、[[曼尼托巴|曼尼托巴]]和[[魁北克|魁北克]]。以前可能最遠南至[[佛羅里達州|佛羅里達州]]，但因洪水或其他地理障礙形成東加拿大狼跟紅狼不同的新品種。在歐洲人來到之後，兩種都面臨嚴重的生存壓力，最後導致在美國的族群滅絕。在加拿大確實的東加拿大狼數量不明。

由於狼隻經常離群，而且在找對象時會長途遷徙，這使生物學家難以保護牠們。狼常常都跑出可以保護牠們的國家公園範圍，並進入如農莊等不歡迎牠們的地方，使大部分狼在公園外死亡。事實上，在1988年到1999年狼的死亡紀錄，最少66%是人類造成的，在公園外射殺和捕獸夾是裝上無線電項圈狼隻最大的死因<ref>見Theberge 1998 及 CBSG 2000</ref>。一隻在1992年7月裝了無線電項圈的狼，曾在10月在「Gatineau Park」（距[[阿爾岡金省立公園|阿爾岡金省立公園]]170公里）被追蹤到。其雖然在12月中又回到[[阿爾岡金省立公園|阿爾岡金省立公園]]，但是隔年的3月被發現了這隻狼殘破的頭，被釘在Round Lake的電話桿上。

== 食性 ==
<!-- Natural [[prey|prey]] for the Eastern Canadian Wolf includes [[deer|deer]], [[hare|hare]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[muskrat|muskrat]]s, and [[beaver|beaver]]s. Prey changes seasonally for wolves. Their favourite prey are [[American_Beaver|American Beaver]]s in [[summer|summer]], and [[White-tailed_Deer|White-tailed Deer]] and [[caribou|caribou]] in the [[winter|winter]] months. 
The Algonquin wolves eat moose, deer, and beaver. On the east side of the Park, where most of the wolf studies have been conducted, the ratio is a diet of about 33% moose (some of which is scavenged), 33% deer, 33% beaver. Wolves will also eat snowshoe hare, particularly on the west side of the park where they are more common, and in some instances, bear. -->
東加拿大狼的獵物包括[[鹿|鹿]]、野兔、鼠類、水豚跟[[海貍|海貍]]，狼群的獵物會隨季節改變。他們最愛的獵物在夏季是美洲海貍，冬季則是白尾鹿跟馴鹿。阿爾岡金狼吃[[馴鹿|馴鹿]]與海貍。

在公園的東部是進行最多狼群研究的地點，約33%的食物是馴鹿（部分為腐敗食物），另外有33%的鹿和33%的海貍。狼群也會吃[[雪靴兔|雪靴兔]]，尤其是在公園西部兔子分佈更廣的地方，在某些情況下他們會吃熊。
