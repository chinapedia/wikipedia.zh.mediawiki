<!-- Some scholars note that after meeting Abraham’s servant, Rebekah “ran and told all this to her ''mother’s'' household” ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#28 Gen. 24:28]), that Rebekah’s “''brother and her mother'' said, ‘Let the maiden remain with us some ten days’” ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#55 Gen. 24:55]), and that “they sent off their ''sister'' Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his men.  And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, ‘O ''sister''!  May you grow into thousands of myriads.” ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#59 Gen. 24:59-60.])  Some scholars thus hypothesize that mention of Bethuel in  [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#50 Gen. 24:50] was a late addition to the preexisting story.  Other scholars argue that these texts indicate that Bethuel was somehow incapacitated.  Still other scholars attribute the emphasis on the mother's role to a matralineal family structure. 

A generation later, Isaac sent [[Jacob|Jacob]] back to Padan-aram to take a wife from among Bethuel’s granddaughters, rather than from among the [[Canaan|Canaanites]]. ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0128.htm Gen. 28:1-2.]) -->  

<!-- ==In rabbinic interpretation==
In the [[Talmud|Talmud]], Rabbi Isaac called Bethuel a wicked man. (Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 64a; see also [[Genesis_Rabba|Genesis Rabbah]] 60:12 (wicked); 63:4 (a rogue); [[Leviticus_Rabbah|Leviticus Rabbah]] 23:1 (a deceiver); [[Shir_ha-Shirim_Rabbah|Song of Songs Rabbah]] 2:4 (a trickster); [[Zohar|Zohar]] 1:136b (sinful); [[Rashi|Rashi]] to [http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=8220&showrashi=true Gen. 25:20] (wicked).)  The [[midrash|midrash]] identified Bethuel as a king. ([[Numbers_Rabbah|Numbers Rabbah]] 14:11.)

In the Talmud, Rab in the name of Rabbi Reuben b. Estrobile cited Laban’s and Bethuel’s response to Abraham’s servant in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|24:50-51|HE}} that “The matter was decreed by the Lord” as a proof text for the proposition that God destines a woman and a man for each other in marriage. (Babylonian Talmud Mo'ed Katan 18b; see also Genesis Rabbah 68:3.)  Rabbi Joshua b. Rabbi Nehemiah in the name of Rabbi Hanina b. Isaac said that the decree with regard to Rebekah that Laban and Bethuel acknowledged came from Mount Moriah. (Genesis Rabbah 60:10.)

Noting that {{Bibleverse||Genesis|24:55|HE}} reports that the next day, Rebekah’s “brother and her mother said, ‘Let the maiden remain with us some ten days’” ({{Bibleverse||Gen.|24:55|HE}}), the Rabbis asked:  “Where was Bethuel?”  The midrash concluded that Bethuel wished to hinder Rebekah’s marriage, and so he was smitten during the night. (Genesis Rabbah 60:12.)  The Rabbis said that Abraham’s servant did not disclose Bethuel’s fate to Isaac. (Genesis Rabbah 60:15.)

In his retelling of the story, [[Josephus|Josephus]] reported that Rebekah told Abraham’s servant, “my father was Bethuel, but he is dead; and Laban is my brother; and, together with my mother, takes care of all our family affairs, and is the guardian of my virginity.” ([[Antiquities_of_the_Jews|''Antiquities'']] [http://www.interhack.net/projects/library/antiquities-jews/b1c16.html 1:16:2:248.]) -->
