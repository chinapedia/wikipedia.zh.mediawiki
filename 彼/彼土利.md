'''彼土利'''（[[希伯来语|希伯来语]]：'''בתואל'''，意为“house of [[God|God]]”）是《[[圣经|圣经]]·[[创世纪|创世纪]]》中的人物，他是一个[[亚兰|亚兰]]人<ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0128.htm#5 创世纪28:5]</ref>，是[[拿鹤|拿鹤]]（Nahor）和[[密迦|密迦]]（Milcah）的小儿子<ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0122.htm#21 创世纪22:21-22]</ref>，[[亚伯拉罕|亚伯拉罕]]的侄子，[[拉班|拉班]]和[[利百加|利百加]]的父亲。 <ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0122.htm#23 创世纪22:23]; [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0128.htm#5 创世纪28:5.]</ref> 

<!-- Bethuel was also a town in the territiory of the [[tribe_of_Simeon|tribe of Simeon]], west of the [[Dead_Sea|Dead Sea]]. ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt25a04.htm#30 1 Chron. 4:30.])  Some scholars (e.g., [[William_F._Albright|Albright]]) identify it with Bethul ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0619.htm#4 Josh. 19:4]) and [[Bethel|Bethel]] in southern [[Judea|Judah]] ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0608.htm#17 Josh. 8:17]; [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0612.htm#16 12:16]), to which [[David|David]] gives booty.

==在圣经中==
彼土利在圣经中一共出现了9次，全部是在[[创世纪|创世纪]]中。<!-- Adherents of the [[documentary_hypothesis|documentary hypothesis]] often attribute most of these verses to the [[Jahwist|Jahwist]] source (E.g., [[Richard_Elliott_Friedman|Richard Elliott Friedman]].

New York: HarperSanFrancisco, 2003; [[Wikisource:Bible,_English,_King_James,_Documentary_Hypothesis,_Genesis|Genesis with sources highlighted, at Wikisource]]) and the remainder to the [[priestly_source|priestly source]].

彼土利住在[[巴旦亚兰|巴旦亚兰]]（Padan-aram） <ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0125.htm#20 创世纪25:20.]</ref>，他的叔叔亚伯拉罕派遣老仆人到自己出生的地方为儿子[[以撒|以撒]]寻找一个妻子<ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#2 创世纪24:2-4.]</ref>。老仆人在拿鹤的城外井边遇见了彼土利的女儿利百加 <ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#10 创世纪24:10-15.]</ref>。老仆人告诉利百加的家人，他幸运地遇见了亚伯拉罕的亲戚，彼土利的女儿<ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#47 创世纪24:47-48.]</ref>。拉班和彼土利回答说， “这事乃出于耶和华，我们不能向你说好说歹。看哪，利百加在你面前，可以将她带去，照着耶和华所说的，给你主人的儿子为妻。”<ref>[http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#50 创世纪24:50-51.]</ref> 

<!-- Some scholars note that after meeting Abraham’s servant, Rebekah “ran and told all this to her ''mother’s'' household” ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#28 Gen. 24:28]), that Rebekah’s “''brother and her mother'' said, ‘Let the maiden remain with us some ten days’” ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#55 Gen. 24:55]), and that “they sent off their ''sister'' Rebekah and her nurse along with Abraham’s servant and his men.  And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, ‘O ''sister''!  May you grow into thousands of myriads.” ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#59 Gen. 24:59-60.])  Some scholars thus hypothesize that mention of Bethuel in  [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0124.htm#50 Gen. 24:50] was a late addition to the preexisting story.  Other scholars argue that these texts indicate that Bethuel was somehow incapacitated.  Still other scholars attribute the emphasis on the mother's role to a matralineal family structure. 

A generation later, Isaac sent [[Jacob|Jacob]] back to Padan-aram to take a wife from among Bethuel’s granddaughters, rather than from among the [[Canaan|Canaanites]]. ([http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0128.htm Gen. 28:1-2.]) -->  

<!-- ==In rabbinic interpretation==
In the [[Talmud|Talmud]], Rabbi Isaac called Bethuel a wicked man. (Babylonian Talmud Yevamot 64a; see also [[Genesis_Rabba|Genesis Rabbah]] 60:12 (wicked); 63:4 (a rogue); [[Leviticus_Rabbah|Leviticus Rabbah]] 23:1 (a deceiver); [[Shir_ha-Shirim_Rabbah|Song of Songs Rabbah]] 2:4 (a trickster); [[Zohar|Zohar]] 1:136b (sinful); [[Rashi|Rashi]] to [http://www.chabad.org/library/article.asp?AID=8220&showrashi=true Gen. 25:20] (wicked).)  The [[midrash|midrash]] identified Bethuel as a king. ([[Numbers_Rabbah|Numbers Rabbah]] 14:11.)

In the Talmud, Rab in the name of Rabbi Reuben b. Estrobile cited Laban’s and Bethuel’s response to Abraham’s servant in {{Bibleverse||Genesis|24:50-51|HE}} that “The matter was decreed by the Lord” as a proof text for the proposition that God destines a woman and a man for each other in marriage. (Babylonian Talmud Mo'ed Katan 18b; see also Genesis Rabbah 68:3.)  Rabbi Joshua b. Rabbi Nehemiah in the name of Rabbi Hanina b. Isaac said that the decree with regard to Rebekah that Laban and Bethuel acknowledged came from Mount Moriah. (Genesis Rabbah 60:10.)

Noting that {{Bibleverse||Genesis|24:55|HE}} reports that the next day, Rebekah’s “brother and her mother said, ‘Let the maiden remain with us some ten days’” ({{Bibleverse||Gen.|24:55|HE}}), the Rabbis asked:  “Where was Bethuel?”  The midrash concluded that Bethuel wished to hinder Rebekah’s marriage, and so he was smitten during the night. (Genesis Rabbah 60:12.)  The Rabbis said that Abraham’s servant did not disclose Bethuel’s fate to Isaac. (Genesis Rabbah 60:15.)

In his retelling of the story, [[Josephus|Josephus]] reported that Rebekah told Abraham’s servant, “my father was Bethuel, but he is dead; and Laban is my brother; and, together with my mother, takes care of all our family affairs, and is the guardian of my virginity.” ([[Antiquities_of_the_Jews|''Antiquities'']] [http://www.interhack.net/projects/library/antiquities-jews/b1c16.html 1:16:2:248.]) -->
