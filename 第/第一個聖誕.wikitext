{{單雙書號轉換|'''第一個聖誕'''}}，又稱{{單雙書號轉換|'''聖誕佳音'''}}（{{lang-en|The First Noel、The First Noël或The First Nowell}}）是一支傳統[[英格蘭|英格蘭]][[聖誕頌歌|聖誕頌歌]]，大約出自18世紀，但也可能更早。<ref>Remembered as the [[Boy_soprano|treble]] part to a carol "Hark, hark the angels sing", according to Annie G. Gilchrist, "Note on the Carol "The First Noel" ''Journal of the Folk-Song Society'' '''5'''19 (June 1915), pp. 240-242.</ref><ref name=hcc>[http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/first_nowell.htm The First Nowell] {{Wayback|url=http://www.hymnsandcarolsofchristmas.com/Hymns_and_Carols/first_nowell.htm |date=20131129214000 }}, ''Hymns and Carols of Christmas''.</ref> “Noel”一詞來自法語[[Noël|Noël]]（即“聖誕節”），而這個法語詞則來自拉丁語“natalis”（即生日）。<ref>{{cite web|title=Noel|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Noel&allowed_in_frame=0|work=Eytmonline: Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=29 December 2011|archive-date=2013-12-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215001301/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Noel&allowed_in_frame=0|dead-url=no}}</ref>

現在流行的版本起源自[[康沃爾郡|康沃爾郡]]，最早出現於《古今頌歌集》（《Carols Ancient and Modern》，1823）和吉爾伯特與山迪頌歌集（《Gilbert and Sandys Carols》，1833）中，這兩個集子的作者都是[[威廉·山迪_(收藏家)|威廉·山迪]]，並由[[大衛·吉爾伯特|大衛·吉爾伯特]]編輯。現在的版本由英國作曲家[[約翰·斯坦納|約翰·斯坦納]]編輯，分成四個部份收錄于其《新舊頌歌集》（《Carols, New and Old》，1871）中。<ref name=hcc/> 此外第一個聖誕的樂譜也有許多變體。

第一個聖誕的一段旋律重複了兩次，并還有一次幾乎一致的旋律，這一點不同於常見的英國民歌。其更早版本可在《[[新牛津頌歌書|新牛津頌歌書]]》中找到。<ref>Keytes and Parrott, ''[[New_Oxford_Book_of_Carols|New Oxford Book of Carols]]'' (《Oxford University Press》, 1992) ISBN 0-19-353323-5.</ref> 此外，後來有許多知名歌手，如[[艾維斯·普里斯萊|艾維斯·普里斯萊]]、[[鮑勃·迪倫|鮑勃·迪倫]]等都在其專輯中收錄過這首歌。
