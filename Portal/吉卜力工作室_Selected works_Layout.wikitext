"If you listen closely"}} is a 1995 [[日本动画|Japanese animated]] drama film directed by [[近藤喜文|近藤喜文]] and written by  [[宫崎骏|宫崎骏]] based on the 1989 manga of the same name by [[柊葵|柊葵]]. The film stars [[本名陽子|本名陽子]], Issei Takahashi, Takashi Tachibana, [[室井滋|室井滋]], Shigeru Tsuyuguchi and [[Keiju_Kobayashi|Keiju Kobayashi]]. It was the first theatrical [[吉卜力工作室|吉卜力工作室]] film to be directed by someone other than Miyazaki or [[高畑勳|高畑勳]].

''Whisper of the Heart'' was Kondō's only film as director before his death in 1998. Studio Ghibli had hoped that Kondō would become the successor to Miyazaki and Takahata. A semi-spin-off film entitled ''[[猫的报恩|猫的报恩]]'' that focused on a minor character of the film, Baron, was released in 2002.

This film focuses on Shizuku Tsukishima, a 14-year-old student at Mukaihara Junior High School. Living in Tokyo with her parents Asako and Seiya, as well as her older sister Shiho, Shizuku is a bookworm and is keen on writing. During an ordinary evening, she looks through the checkout cards in her library books. She discovers they have all been checked out by Seiji Amasawa. She begins to daydream about this mysterious man who shares her taste in books. Being a curious girl, she aims to find out who this man is. Coincidentally, Shizuku soon encounters an annoying young man, later revealed to be Seiji, who often teases her.
