  |text=In [[ballet|ballet]], a [[pas_de_deux|pas de deux]] is a dance duet in which two dancers, typically a male and a female, perform ballet steps together. It usually has five parts, consisting of an entrée (introduction), an adagio, two variations (a solo for each dancer), and a coda (finale). The pas de deux is characteristic of classical ballet and can be found in many well-known ballets. It is often considered to be the bravura highlight of a ballet and is usually performed by a leading pair of [[principal_dancer|principal dancer]]s.
