{{Portal:捕鱼/Selected_quote/Layout|text="'''Blast fishing''' or '''dynamite fishing''' describes the practice of using dynamite, homemade bombs or other explosives to stun or kill schools of fish for easy collection. This practice can be extremely destructive to the surrounding ecosystem, as the shockwaves often destroy the underlying habitat (such as coral reefs close to a coastline) that supports the fish. The frequently improvised nature of the explosives used also means danger for the fishermen as well, with accidents and injuries."
