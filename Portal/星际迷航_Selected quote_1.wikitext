  |quote=''Star Trek'' speaks to some basic human needs: that there is a tomorrow — it's not all going to be over with a big flash and a bomb; that the human race is improving; that we have things to be proud of as humans. No, ancient astronauts did not build the pyramids — <em>human beings</em> built them, because they're clever and they work hard. And ''Star Trek'' is about <em>those</em> things.
