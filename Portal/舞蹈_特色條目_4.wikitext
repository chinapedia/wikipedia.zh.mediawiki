  |text= '''[[Acro_dance|Acro dance]]''' is a style of [[dance|dance]] that combines classical dance technique with precision [[acrobatic|acrobatic]] elements. It is defined by its athletic character, its unique [[choreography|choreography]], which seamlessly blends dance and acrobatics, and its use of acrobatics in a dance context. It is a popular dance style in amateur [[competitive_dance|competitive dance]] as well as in professional dance theater, such as [[Cirque_du_Soleil|Cirque du Soleil]]. Acro dance is known by various other names including ''acrobatic dance'' and ''gymnastic dance'', though it is most commonly referred to simply as ''acro'' by dancers and dance professionals.

Acrobatic dance emerged in the [[United_States|United States]] and [[Canada|Canada]] in the early 1900s as one of the types of acts performed in [[vaudeville|vaudeville]]. Although individual dance and acrobatic acts had been performed in vaudeville for several decades prior to 1900, it was not until the early 1900s that it became popular to perform acts that combined dance and acrobatic movements. Since the decline of the vaudeville era, acrobatic dance has undergone a multi-faceted evolution to arrive at its present-day form. The most significant aspect of this evolution is the integration of ballet technique as the foundation for dance movements, thus bringing into acro dance a precision of form and movement that was absent in vaudeville acrobatic dance.
