  |text='''Salmon''' is the common name for several species of [[fish|fish]] of the family [[Salmonidae|Salmonidae]]. Several other fish in the family are called [[trout|trout]]. Salmon live in both the [[Atlantic_Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific_Ocean|Pacific Ocean]]s, as well as the [[Great_Lakes|Great Lakes]] and other land locked lakes.

Salmon has long been at the heart of the culture and livelihood of coastal dwellers. Most peoples of the Northern Pacific shore had a ceremony to honor the first return of the year. For many centuries, people caught salmon as they swam upriver to spawn. A famous [[spearfishing|spearfishing]] site on the [[Columbia_River|Columbia River]] at [[Celilo_Falls|Celilo Falls]] was inundated after great dams were built on the river. The [[Ainu_cuisine|Ainu]], of northern [[Japan|Japan]], taught dogs how to catch salmon as they returned to their breeding grounds ''en masse''.
