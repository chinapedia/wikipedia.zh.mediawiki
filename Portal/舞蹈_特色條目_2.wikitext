  |text='''[[Ballroom_dance|Ballroom dance]],''' refers collectively to a set of [[partner_dance|partner dance]]s, which originated in the [[Western_world|Western world]] and are now enjoyed both [[social_dance|socially]] and [[ballroom_dance#Competitive_dancing|competitively]] around the globe.  Its [[performance_dance|performance]] and [[entertainment|entertainment]] aspects are also widely enjoyed on [[Theater|stage]], in [[film|film]], and on [[television|television]]. 

While historically ''ballroom dance'' may refer to any form of formal social dancing as recreation, with the eminence of [[dancesport|dancesport]] in modern times the term has become much narrower in scope, usually referring specifically to the International Standard and International Latin style dances (see [[#Dance_groupings|dance groupings]] below).  In the United States, two additional variations—"American Smooth" and "American Rhythm"—have also been popularized and are commonly recognized as styles of "ballroom dance".

The term "ballroom dancing" is derived from the word ''[[Ball_(dance)|ball]]'', which in turn originates from the [[Latin_language|Latin]] word ''ballare'' which means "to dance". In times past, ballroom dancing was "[[Social_dance|social dancing]]" for the privileged, leaving "[[folk_dancing|folk dancing]]" for the lower classes.  These boundaries have since become blurred, and it should be noted even in times long gone, many "ballroom" dances were really elevated folk dances.
