  |text='''[[Hip_hop_dance|Hip Hop dance]]''' refers to [[dance|dance]] styles primarily danced to [[hip_hop_music|hip hop music]] or that have evolved as a part of the [[hip_hop_culture|hip hop culture]]. This includes a wide range of styles such as [[breakdance|breaking]], [[popping|popping]], [[locking|locking]], and [[krumping|krumping]]. Breaking, locking, and popping were developed in the 1970s by [[African_American|Black]] and [[Latino_American|Latino American]]s. Krumping followed in the 1990s and was developed by [[African_American|Black]] Americans in [[Compton,_CA|Compton, CA]].

What separates hip hop dance from other forms of dance is that it is often [[improvisation|improvisation]]al (freestyle) in nature and hip hop dancers frequently engage in battles—formal or informal one on one dance competitions. Freestyle sessions and battles are usually performed in a ''cipher'', a circular dance space which forms naturally once the dancing begins. It was DJ [[Afrika_Bambaataa|Afrika Bambaataa]] that outlined the five pillars of hip hop culture including [[breaking|breaking]] as one of them (along with [[rapping|rapping]], [[DJing|DJing]], [[beatboxing|beatboxing]], and [[graffiti|graffiti]]).

The dance industry responded to hip hop dance by creating a more commercial version of it. This "studio hip hop", sometimes called ''new style'' is the kind of hip hop dancing seen in most [[rap_music|rap]] and [[R&B|R&B]] [[music_video|music video]]s. Technically speaking, hip hop dance (''new style'' hip hop that is) is characterized as hard hitting. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, and the body is kept loose so that a dancer can easily alternate between hitting the beat or riding through the beat. This is in contrast to [[ballet|ballet]] or [[ballroom|ballroom]] dancing where the chest is upright and the body is stiff. In addition, ''new style'' hip hop is very rhythmic and there's a lot of emphasis placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music.
