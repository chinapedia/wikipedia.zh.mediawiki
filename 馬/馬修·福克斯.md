== 經歷 ==
=== 早期生活 ===
福克斯出生於[[美國|美國]][[賓州|賓州]]的[[亞賓頓|亞賓頓]]（Abington），他在位於[[懷俄明州|懷俄明州]][[克羅哈特|克羅哈特區]]（Crowheart）一間飼養[[馬|馬]]的[[牧場|牧場]]長大。他的父親法蘭西斯·福克斯（Francis G. Fox）是一名[[地理學家|地理學家]]和牧場主人，福克斯的母親羅芮塔·愛格諾（Loretta B. Eagono）在學校擔任[[老師|老師]]<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/fox.htm</ref>。他有一個姊姊—小法蘭西斯（Francis, Jr.）和弟弟貝亞德（Bayard）。福克斯自風河高中（Wind River High School）畢業之後，他到位於[[麻薩諸塞州|麻省]]的狄爾菲爾德預備學校（[[:en:Deerfield_Academy|Deerfield Academy]]）就讀，一年後他進入[[哥倫比亞大學|哥倫比亞大學]]。福克斯在哥倫比亞[[美式足球|美式足球]]隊中擔任[[外接員|外接員]]（wide receiver，或稱翼鋒），他還參與了一場讓哥倫比亞大學終止44場連敗惡夢的關鍵比賽。<!--

At Columbia, he played wide receiver, participating in the game that led to the end of Columbia's notorious 44-game losing streak. He was also a member of [[Phi_Gamma_Delta|Phi Gamma Delta]] Fraternity. After graduating in [[1988|1988]], he began acting with the [[Atlantic_Theater_Company|Atlantic Theater Company]]. He also attended the [[School_for_Film_and_Television|School for Film and Television]] in [[New_York_City|New York City]]. 

Fox sought a career on Wall Street before turning a job offer down.<ref>According to an interview in the March 2006 issue of ''[[GQ|GQ]]''</ref> He studied economics at Columbia and upon his graduation applied for a job to sell stocks at [[Prudential_Bache|Prudential-Bache]]. "I didn't have a suit, so I had to borrow one from a friend. He was 5-10, and I'm 6-2, so the thing didn't fit. And I borrowed his penny loafers," he said.  He described the staff as "all these mid-20s, Type A, go-getting wannabe [[Gordon_Gekko|Gordon Gekko]]s. There was just so much testosterone flying around, in all the wrong directions ... I'll never forget the moment as long as I live: We're saying goodbye, and they were like, 'Well, y'know, you're gonna come here and kick ass, and it's all gonna be great!' and then one of 'em says, 'But he's gonna have to do something about those shoes!' They all had exactly the same pair of Oxford shoes on. In that moment, I [said], 'There's no way I can do this.'" <ref>http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_4203</ref>

===Career===
At the age of 25, Fox made his debut on an episode of ''[[Wings_(TV_series)|Wings]]''. That same year, he also starred on a short-lived [[dramatic|dramatic]] series, [[Freshman_Dorm|Freshman Dorm]]. Still not being a familiar face on the small screen, he continued receiving supporting roles, including the [[CBS|CBS]] [[Schoolbreak_Special|Schoolbreak Special]] series, [[If_I_Die_Before_I_Wake|If I Die Before I Wake]] before he made his big screen debut in ''[[My_Boyfriend's_Back|My Boyfriend's Back]]'' ([[1993|1993]]).

In [[1994|1994]], Fox was cast in a co-starring role as the eldest of the five siblings who lost both parents in a car accident on the critically-acclaimed [[1990|1990]]s [[teen|teen]] [[drama|drama]], ''[[Party_of_Five|Party of Five]]'', as [[Charlie_Salinger|Charlie Salinger]], [[FOX|FOX]]'s attempt at repeating the success of such successful [[serials|serials]] such as: ''[[Beverly_Hills_90210|Beverly Hills 90210]]'' and its spin-off, ''[[Melrose_Place|Melrose Place]]''. In that very first season, ''Party'' connected to audiences and teenagers to form the television media. The network needed to deliver the compassion and care to Fox's character, Salinger, a man who was ripped apart with his family and felt the need to take care of his other siblings. During his tenure on ''Party'', both he and co-star Wolf set many hearts aflutter, appearing on many [[teen_magazines|teen magazines]] and posters. He even got to make numerous friends on the set and even saw a young singer and unrecognizable actress, [[Jennifer_Love_Hewitt|Jennifer Love Hewitt]] (who went on to do ''[[Sarah|Sarah]]'' before ''[[Ghost_Whisperer|Ghost Whisperer]]''), audition for the series second season, and the connection of both Fox and Hewitt were quite a phenomenon. In [[1996|1996]], ''[[People_Magazine|People Magazine]]'' named Fox as one of the [[50_Most_Beautiful_People_in_the_World|50 Most Beautiful People in the World]].

After Fox's ''Party'' came to an end after six long seasons, he starred in another TV series ''[[Haunted_(TV_series)|Haunted]]'', in [[2002|2002]], but the show didn't match the popularity of ''[[Party_of_Five|Party of Five]]'', eight years after.

Since [[September|September]] [[2004|2004]], Fox has been playing the role of the troubled and dedicated surgeon, [[Dr._Jack_Shephard|Dr. Jack Shephard]], on ''[[Lost_(TV_series)|Lost]]''. Reportedly, it was his idea to seek a role in the series as he was about to travel to [[Hawaii|Hawaii]] with several other cast members. He initially auditioned for the role of [[James_"Sawyer"_Ford|James "Sawyer" Ford]]. However, co-creator [[J.J._Abrams|J.J. Abrams]] was so pleased with his reading of the Dr. Shephard character that Fox was cast in the lead role. Reportedly, he was permitted to read the entire top-secret [[pilot|pilot]] script. As the star of the series, he is also the highest-paid actor on the show. This series would also compare to Fox's ''Party of Five'', a decade after its debut that Fox already noticed that it was another top-rated show. He is also the only actor to appear in almost every episode of the series, with the exception of four in the last two seasons. For his work on ''Lost'', Fox was nominated for a [[Golden_Globe|Golden Globe]]. He also won the [[2005|2005]] [[Satellite_Award|Satellite Award]] and shared the [[2006|2006]] [[Screen_Actors_Guild_Award|Screen Actors Guild Award]] for ''Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series''.

On [[December_2|December 2]], he hosted ''[[Saturday_Night_Live|Saturday Night Live]]'' with musical guests [[Tenacious_D|Tenacious D]]. In the monologue for that episode, he talked about how he was never chosen to host SNL during his days on [[Party_of_Five|Party of Five]] and named off other popular TV show stars who never hosted SNL, including [[Seinfeld's|Seinfeld's]] [[Michael_Richards|Michael Richards]] (played by [[Bill_Hader|Bill Hader]]). The following week, he appeared in a [[SNL_Digital_Shorts|digital short]] that was cut from his episode.<ref>http://www.nbc.com/Saturday_Night_Live/episodes/Show_1478.shtml</ref>

In 2006, Fox co-starred with [[Matthew_McConaughey|Matthew McConaughey]] in the sports drama, ''[[We_Are_Marshall|We Are Marshall]]''. He is also set to star in the [[2007|2007]] thriller, ''[[Vantage_Point_(film)|Vantage Point]]'' and also played a bit part in the action film [[Smokin'_Aces|Smokin' Aces]].

He has also been announced as being cast as Racer X, the rival of the title character in [[Speed_Racer_(film)|Speed Racer]].<sup>[http://iesb.net/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2325&Itemid=99]</sup>
