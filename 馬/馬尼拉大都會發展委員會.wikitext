They enjoy security of tenure and may be removed for cause in accordance with law. 

The Assistant General Manager for Planning should have not less than five (5) years extensive experience in development and planning or must hold a master's degree in urban planning or similar disciplines. 

==History==
* '''February 27, 1975.''' President [[Ferdinand_Marcos|Ferdinand Marcos]] issued [[Presidential_Decree|Presidential Decree]] 824 creating the Metropolitan Manila Commission (MMC). It integrates the Philippine capital [[Manila|Manila]] and adjacent [[Quezon_City|Quezon City]] with 2 cities and 12 municipalities of the province of [[Rizal|Rizal]] and 1 municipality of the province of [[Bulacan|Bulacan]]. Marcos appointed his wife [[Imelda_Marcos|Imelda Marcos]] as governor and Ismael Mathay, Jr. as vice-governor. The office was located in front of the GMA-7 TV station at [[EDSA|EDSA]] corner Timog Avenue, Diliman, Quezon City. 

* '''January 9, 1990.''' President [[Corazon_Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]] issued Executive Order No. 392, in accordance to Article 18, Section 8 of the 1987 [[Philippine_Constitution|Philippine Constitution]], creating  Metro Manila Authority (MMA). The Metro Manila mayors will choose from themselves as chairman. Jejomar Binay of the municipality of [[Makati|Makati]] served as its first chairman. The agency transferred its office to Guadalupe, [[Makati_City|Makati]]. Binay was followed by Ignacio Bunye of municipality of [[Muntinlupa|Muntinlupa]] in 1991, Ismael Mathay, Jr. of Quezon City in 1992 then Prospero Oreta of the municipality of [[Malabon|Malabon]] in 1994.

* '''March 1, 1995.''' Since the elected chairman is one of the mayors of Metro Manila, the role to his constituency gave less attention. Thus, the [[Philippine_Congress|Philippine Congress]], composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives, passed Republic Act No. 7924 creating the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA).

* '''May 1995.''' Prospero Oreta did not run in the Malabon municipal election. President [[Fidel_Ramos|Fidel Ramos]] appointed him as the first Chairman of the MMDA and made him independent of the Metro Manila mayors.

* '''June 1998.''' Jejomar Binay was prohibited by law from running for his fourth consecutive term as mayor of [[Makati_City|Makati City]].  President [[Joseph_Estrada|Joseph E. Estrada]] appointed him as the second Chairman of the MMDA.

* '''January 2001.''' After the removal of [[Joseph_Estrada|Joseph E. Estrada]] as President, President [[Gloria_Macapagal-Arroyo|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] removed Binay from office and appointed Benjamin C. Abalos Sr. as Chairman. Abalos served as Mayor of [[Mandaluyong_City|Mandaluyong City]] from 1986 to 1998. In May of the same year, Binay ran as Mayor of Makati City and won. Since then, Binay has been a critic of the MMDA and advocated for its abolition.

* '''February 2002.''' Abalos was appointed Chairman of the Commission on Elections of the Philippines. President [[Gloria_Macapagal-Arroyo|Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] appointed [[Bayani_Fernando|Bayani Fernando]] as the fourth Chairman of the MMDA. Fernando served as Mayor of [[Marikina_City|Marikina City]] from 1992 to 2001. He was credited for transforming Marikina from a 4th class municipality to a model Philippine city.

* '''MMDA Today.''' Well-known for his work as Mayor of Marikina City, Bayani Fernando was then appointed as Chairman of the MMDA. He launched the "Metro Gwapo" drive to start the advocacy of turning Metro Manila to the pride of the Philippines as its capital. He created the Sidewalk Clearing Operations Department, which aimed to clear all sidewalks from illegal structures. Among these are the sidewalks of the North Luzon Central Market (Cloverleaf Market) in Balintawak, Quezon City. The national government saved money because of his decision to change the design of some existing intersections by installing numerous U-turn slots and steel pedestrian overpasses, which he called "''footbridges''". Metro Manila became notable for becoming the Asian metropolis with a unique male sidewalk urinal. Among the 17 cities and municipalities of Metro Manila, the City of [[Makati|Makati]] and the city of [[San_Juan,_Metro_Manila|San Juan]] disapprove of Fernando's proposals. As a result, these locations do not have major MMDA projects constructed nor deputized traffic enforcers.
