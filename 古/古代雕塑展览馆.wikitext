== 历史 ==

古代雕塑展览馆及其周围的一批工程——[[国王广场|国王广场]]和州立文物博物馆（Staatliche Antikensammlung）所在建筑，都是巴伐利亚王储（后来成为国王）路德维希一世所建的古希腊文化的纪念建筑。他想象一个“德国雅典”以留下古希腊文化的记忆，他在慕尼黑的大门前建造了这座建筑。 

国王广场是由Karl von Fischer和Leo von Klenze于1815年设计，<!--  the latter  arranged it in the style of a forum, with the Glyptothek on the north side. Colorful frescoes and stuccos made by distinguished artists such as [[Peter_von_Cornelius|Peter von Cornelius]] and [[Wilhelm_von_Kaulbach|Wilhelm von Kaulbach]] adorned the walls of the museum.

In the few years between [[1806|1806]] and the opening of the museum in [[1830|1830]], Ludwig completed one of the most magnificent collections of Greek and Roman sculpture. Through his agents, he managed to acquire such pieces as the [[Medusa|Medusa]] Rondanini, the [[Barberini_Faun|Barberini Faun]], and, in [[1813|1813]], the figures from the Aphaea temple on [[Aegina|Aegina]].

The [[Second_World_War|Second World War]] did not destroy much of the artwork in the Glyptothek; unfortunately, the frescoes did not survive and only lightly plastered bricks were visible after the museum was reopened in [[1972|1972]]. -->

== 建筑 ==

<!-- The museum was designed in the Classical Greek - Italian style.  The portico is [[Ionic_order|Ionic]], and the outer walls contain niches, in which 18 original Roman and Greek sculptures stand, six on each wall (except the back). The interior has domed vaulting.

The museum was originally built completely out of marble. However, [[World_War_II|World War II]] took its toll, and the edifice of the museum was destroyed. The reconstructed museum is not as beautiful as it used to be - the Ionic columns were left unfinished and not fluted, and some sculptures were likewise left undone. The reconstructed building is made out of much less marble than the pre-war building. This is evident when one looks at the walls from the interior; they are composed of red brick and painted only with a light plaster to give a marble effect. The frescoes that used to line the walls also did not make it through the war. -->

<!-- The Glyptothek contains sculptures dating from the archaic age (ca. [[650_BC|650 BCE]]) to the Roman era (ca. 400 CE). --> 

<!-- ===[[Archaic_period_in_Greece|Archaic period]] (700-490 BC)===
Among the most famous sculptures here are the ''[[Munich_Kouros|Munich Kouros]]'' (statue of an adolescent from Attica, ca 540 BC), the ''[[Kouros_of_Tenea|Kouros of Tenea]]'' (statue of an adolescent from Corinth, ca 560 BC) and the [[Temple_of_Aphaea|temple figures from Aegina]]. Of the latter, there are in fact two sets of similar sculptures at the Glyptothek. As archeologists excavated the site at Aegina, these two sets were discovered, and it was later theorized that the original temple was destroyed during the [[Peloponnesian_War|Peloponnesian War]] and another temple was erected shortly after in its place. The Greeks had not bothered to clear the area, and had left the remains of the original temple buried at the same location. -->
=== 古典时期(490–323 BC) ===
<!-- To the most famous sculptures belong the ''portrait of Homer'' (460 BC), the ''[[Statue_of_Diomedes|Statue of Diomedes]]'' (430 BC), the ''[[Medusa_Rondanini|Medusa Rondanini]]'' (440 BC), the ''[[Funeral_stele_of_Mnesarete|Funeral stele of Mnesarete]]'' (380 BC), the ''[[Statue_of_Eirene|Statue of Eirene]]'' (370 BC), the ''[[Alexander_Rondanini|Alexander Rondanini]]'' (ca. 338 BC) and the ''[[Ilioneus|Ilioneus]]'' (ca 320 BC). -->

=== 希腊化时期(323–146 BC) ===
<!-- The most famous sculpture representing this time is the ''[[Barberini_Faun|Barberini Faun]]'' (220 BC).
Among the famous Roman copies of Greek sculptures are the the ''[[Boy_with_the_Goose|Boy with the Goose]]'' (ca 250 BC) and the ''[[Drunken_Woman|Drunken Woman]]'' (attributed to [[Myron_of_Thebes|Myron of Thebes]]; ca 200 BC). -->

=== 罗马雕塑 (150 BC - 400 AD) ===
<!-- The Glyptothek keeps a large collection of Roman [[Bust_(sculpture)|busts]], among the most famous ones are the busts of the Emperors [[Augustus|Augustus]] (ca 40 AD), [[Nero|Nero]] (65 AD), [[Septimius_Severus|Septimius Severus]] (200 AD) and his wife [[Julia_Domna|Julia Domna]] (195 AD).

Other notable sculptures, mosaics and reliefs can also be found here. This collection is complemented by the terracotta and bronze collections in the [[Staatliche_Antikensammlung|Staatliche Antikensammlung]] (State Collection of Greek and Roman Antiquities), which is located opposite the Glyptothek. -->
