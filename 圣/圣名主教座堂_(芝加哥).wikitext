=== 青铜大门 ===

前来礼拜的信徒首先会看见厚重的青铜大门，该门重达1200磅，由Albert J. Friscia设计。<!--  The doors introduce the overall "Tree of Life" theme with intricate details that serve to make the doors look like overwhelming planks of wood. The doors possess a hydraulic system that allows them to be opened with the push of a finger.  Beyond the doors is a vestibule encased in glass. -->

=== 复活苦像 ===

一进入教堂，最令人震撼的景象就是悬浮的“复活苦像”（Resurrection Crucifix）雕塑，<!--  by the artist [[Ivo_Demetz|Ivo Demetz]]. Adorning the walls of the nave are the [[Stations_of_the_Cross|Stations of the Cross]] by artist [[Goffredo_Verginelli|Goffredo Verginelli]] depicting the Passion, Crucifixion and Resurrection of Christ.  The stations are cast in bronze and framed in red Rocco Alicante marble. -->

<!-- ====Ambo of the Evangelists====

Various bronze sculptures are featured in other parts of the church.  One of the largest pieces is the ''Ambo of the Evangelists'' by [[Eugenio_de_Courten|Eugenio de Courten]].  An ''[[ambo|ambo]]'', in church liturgy, is the lectern from which readings of [[Holy_Scripture|Holy Scripture]] are proclaimed.  The bronze casting depicts the authors of the [[Gospels|Gospels]] with their symbols: [[Matthew_the_Evangelist|Matthew]] the [[angel|angel]] representing the Gospel of the Church; [[Mark_the_Evangelist|Mark]], the [[lion|lion]] and inspiration for Peter’s teachings or catechesis; [[Luke_the_Evangelist|Luke]], the [[ox|ox]], for his recounting of Christ’s infancy; [[John_the_Evangelist|John]], the [[eagle|eagle]], for the writer of the Spiritual Gospel, recounting the story of "the Word made flesh." -->

<!-- ====Ambo of the Epistle Writers====

Also by de Courten is the ''Ambo of the Evangelists'', a bronze casting depicting the authors of the apostolic letters to the early Church communities: [[Peter|Peter]], with keys to the Kingdom of God; [[Paul|Paul]], who died by the sword; [[James|James]], representing faith sustained by good works; and [[Jude_the_Apostle|Jude]], carrying a whip representing correction.  This particular ambo is used by lectors and cantors during Sunday masses and other special Church feasts and memorials. -->

=== 祭坛 ===
<!-- Six tons of monolithic red-black Rosso Imperiale di Solberga granite forms the ''mensa'' or table top of the altar.  The pedestal is encircled by a bronze bas-relief depicting [[Old_Testament|Old Testament]] scenes of sacrificial offerings and preparation: Abel's offering of the first sacrifice, the priest Melchizedek giving bread and wine, Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his son Isaac, and the Prophet Elijah receiving bread and water from the Angel of the Lord for strength to continue on his journey.  The consecrated altar contains relics, or actual artifacts from the bodies of [[John_the_Apostle|Saint John the Apostle]] and [[Timothy|Saint Timothy]]. -->

<!-- ====Cathedra of the See of Chicago====

A ''[[cathedra|cathedra]]'', or bishop's throne, is what makes the church a [[cathedral|cathedral]].  It is from this chair that ''Sede Chicagiensis'', or See of Chicago, is presided over by the archbishop of Chicago. Unlike most Roman Catholic cathedra, the ''Cathedra of the See of Chicago'' is plain and simple.  Its back contains three panels depicting the first Christian teachers: Christ in the center panel, and [[Saint_Peter|Saint Peter]] to his left and [[Paul_of_Tarsus|Saint Paul]] to his right. -->

<!-- ====Sanctuary Panels of the Holy Name====

Above the ''cathedra'' are the ''Sanctuary Panels of the Holy Name'', five bronze panels by [[Attilio_Selva|Attilio Selva]] representing the Holy Name of Jesus from which the church gets its name.  The first panel is of Simeon contemplating the ''Infant Savior'' whom Mary presents in the Temple.  The second panel depicts the ''Mystery of the Trinity'' and an angel carrying the monogram of Christ to earth.  The third panel is of the ''Risen Christ'' proclaimed as ''Lord''.  The fourth panel is of the ''Presentation of Jesus in the Temple'' showing Mary and Joseph presenting the child for circumcision and naming.  The last panel is of the ''Priesthood of Jesus'', with Christ adorned in vestments presenting the chalice to all people. -->

<!-- ====Galeri of the Cardinals====

Holy Name Cathedral continues the tradition of raising the [[galero|galero]], a wide-brimmed tasseled hat, of a deceased [[cardinal_(Catholicism)|cardinal]] over the ''cathedra'' from the highest point of the semicircular, domed cathedral apse. The galero is hung forever over the congregants of Holy Name Cathedral where they remain until they are reduced to dust, symbolizing how all earthly glory is passing.  Looking up above the ''Cathedra of the See of Chicago'' are the galeros of, from left to right, Cardinals Meyer, Bernardin, Mundelein, Cody and Stritch. -->

==1871年芝加哥大火==
<small>參見[[芝加哥大火|芝加哥大火]]</small>
<!-- At the time of the founding of the Diocese of Chicago on [[September_30|September 30]],[[1843|1843]], [[William_Quarter|Bishop William Quarter]] led his faithful from the Cathedral of Saint Mary at the southwest corner of Madison and Wabash Streets.A few years later in [[1851|1851]], an immense brick church called the Church of the Holy Name was being constructed on 州街 between Huron and Superior streets.  Its cornerstone was set in [[1852|1852]]。In October of 1871 however, both churches were destroyed as the Great Chicago Fire engulfed all of the city.  Church of the Holy Name pastor [[John_McMullen|John McMullen]] travelled the country to raise funds to rebuild the churches and to aid the homeless of Chicago.  Meanwhile, Chicago's Catholics were forced to worship in what was called the ''shanty cathedral'', a boarded-up burnt house on Cass Street. They worshiped there for over four years. -->
<!-- ==Breaking ground for the new cathedral==

In [[1874|1874]], [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn]] [[architect|architect]] [[Patrick_Charles_Keely|Patrick Charles Keely]] who would later also design [[St._Stanislaus_Kostka_in_Chicago|St. Stanislaus Kostka]] was selected to draw plans for the new cathedral of Chicago.  On [[July_19|July 19]] of that year, the cornerstone was finally laid.  On [[November_21|November 21]] of the following year, Bishop Thomas Foley dedicated the church and christened it the Cathedral of the Holy Name.  In [[1880|1880]], the Diocese of Chicago was reorganized to become the Archdiocese of Chicago and 圣名主教座堂 became the church of primacy over several other dioceses in 美国中西部。 -->

<!-- ==Early renovations==

In [[1888|1888]], surveyors noticed that the cathedral was sagging on its Superior Street side.  The prompted the archbishop to commence with the cathedral's first renovation projects.  By [[1915|1915]], Holy Name Cathedral was balanced out and saved from sinking into the ground.  It was also lengthened by 15 feet to accommodate the growing Catholic population.  That same year, [[James_Edward_Quigley|James Edward Quigley]], Archbishop of Chicago, died.  The first major Mass of the newly rededicated cathedral was the late archbishop's funeral. -->

<!-- ==George Cardinal Mundelein== -->

<!-- In [[1924|1924]], [[George_Cardinal_Mundelein|Archbishop George W. Mundelein]] was elevated by the [[pope|pope]] to become a cardinal.  When he returned from consistory at the [[Vatican_City|Vatican]], the new cardinal was greeted at Holy Name Cathedral with a celebratory procession of over 80,000 Catholics.  Cardinal Mundelein gained new followers and became a beloved pastoral leader.

When Cardinal Mundelein died unexpectedly in his sleep in October [[1939|1939]], [[Chicago_City_Hall|Chicago City Hall]] hastily paved State Street where the subway was being constructed to accommodate the great influx of mourners expected to make the pilgrimage.  As Cardinal Mundelein lay in state in the nave of Holy Name Cathedral, over a million people paid their last respects. -->

<!-- ==Second Vatican Council==

As soon as the Second Vatican Council was concluded in the 1960s, Holy Name Cathedral proceeded with a massive renovation project to alter the cathedral interior.  From Easter [[1968|1968]] to [[1969|1969]], Holy Name Cathedral was closed and masses were held in various locations including a nearby school gymnasium.  At midnight on Christmas Eve of 1969, Holy Name Cathedral was reopened and the first English language mass was celebrated with the presider actually facing the congregation for the first time. -->

<!-- ==Papal Visit of 1979==

[[Pope_John_Paul_II|Pope John Paul II]] became the first Pontiff to preside over Holy Name Cathedral in October [[1979|1979]].  On two successive evenings, Pope John Paul II was treated to the music of [[Luciano_Pavarotti|Luciano Pavarotti]] and the [[Chicago_Symphony_Orchestra|Chicago Symphony Orchestra]] in the nave of the cathedral. -->
