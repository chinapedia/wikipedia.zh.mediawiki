The northern [[Sierra_Pelona_Mountains|Sierra Pelona Mountains]], northwestern [[Topatopa_Mountains|Topatopa Mountains]], southern [[Santa_Ana_Mountains|Santa Ana Mountains]], and [[Downtown_Los_Angeles|Downtown Los Angeles]] skyscrapers can be seen from higher neighborhoods, passes, and parks in the San Fernando Valley.

The [[Los_Angeles_River|Los Angeles River]] begins at the confluence of [[Arroyo_Calabasas|Calabasas Creek (''Arroyo Calabasas'')]] and [[Bell_Creek_(Southern_California)|Bell Creek]] (''Escorpión Creek''), between [[Canoga_Park_High_School|Canoga Park High School]] and Owensmouth Avenue (just north of Vanowen Street) in [[Canoga_Park,_Los_Angeles|Canoga Park]]. These creeks' [[river_source|headwaters]] are in the Santa Monica [[Calabasas,_California|Calabasas]] foothills, the Simi Hills' [[Hidden_Hills,_California|Hidden Hills]], [[Santa_Susana_Field_Laboratory|Santa Susana Field Laboratory]], and [[Santa_Susana_Pass_State_Historic_Park|Santa Susana Pass Park]] lands. The river flows eastward along the southern regions of the Valley. One of the river's two unpaved sections can be found at the [[Sepulveda_Basin|Sepulveda Basin]].  A seasonal river, the [[Tujunga_Wash|Tujunga Wash]], drains much of the western facing San Gabriel Mountains and passes into and then through the [[Hansen_Dam|Hansen Dam]] Recreation Center in Lake View Terrace. It flows south along the Verdugo Mountains through the eastern communities of the valley to join the Los Angeles River in [[Studio_City,_Los_Angeles|Studio City]]. Other notable tributaries of the river include Dayton Creek, Caballero Creek, [[Bull_Creek_(Los_Angeles_County)|Bull Creek]], [[Pacoima_Wash|Pacoima Wash]], and [[Verdugo_Wash|Verdugo Wash]]. The elevation of the floor of the valley varies from about {{convert|600|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1200|ft|m|abbr=on}} above [[sea_level|sea level]].

Most of the San Fernando Valley is within the jurisdiction of the [[City_of_Los_Angeles|City of Los Angeles]],<ref name="WSJ_2018.03.29">{{cite news |last1=McLaughlin |first1=Katy |title=Living in 'the Valley' Is, Like, Cool Now |newspaper=[[The_Wall_Street_Journal|The Wall Street Journal]] |date=March 29, 2018 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/living-in-the-valley-is-like-cool-now-1522332000 |access-date=September 15, 2018 |quote=The majority of the San Fernando Valley lies within the city of Los Angeles, but <u>locals nonetheless tend to refer to it as 'the Valley'</u> and to the rest of Los Angeles as 'the city'. |archive-date=2020-11-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124104923/https://www.wsj.com/articles/living-in-the-valley-is-like-cool-now-1522332000 |dead-url=no }}</ref> although a few other incorporated cities are located within the valley as well: [[Burbank,_California|Burbank]] is in the southeastern corner of the valley, and [[San_Fernando,_California|San Fernando]], which is completely surrounded by Los Angeles, is in the northeastern valley. [[Universal_City,_California|Universal City]], an enclave in the southern part of the valley, is an unincorporated area housing the [[Universal_Studios|Universal Studios]] filming lot and theme park. [[Mulholland_Drive|Mulholland Drive]], which runs along the ridgeline of the Santa Monica Mountains, marks the boundary between the valley and the communities of [[Hollywood|Hollywood]] and the [[Westside_(Los_Angeles_County)|Los Angeles Westside]].
The San Fernando Valley has connection to other regions: The [[Santa_Clarita_Valley|Santa Clarita Valley]] via [[Newhall_Pass|Newhall Pass]], the [[Westside_(Los_Angeles_County)|Westside]] via [[Sepulveda_Pass|Sepulveda Pass]], [[Hollywood|Hollywood]] via [[Cahuenga_Pass|Cahuenga Pass]], Simi Valley via [[Santa_Susana_Pass|Santa Susana Pass]], and the [[Crescenta_Valley|Crescenta Valley]] via [[Interstate_210_and_State_Route_210_(California)|Interstate 210]].
 
=== Habitat ===
The valley's natural habitat is a "[[temperate_grasslands,_savannas,_and_shrublands|temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome|biome]]" of [[grassland|grassland]], [[California_oak_woodland|oak savanna]], and [[Chaparral|chaparral shrub forest]] types of [[plant_community|plant community]] [[habitat|habitat]]s, along with lush [[riparian_zone|riparian plants]] along the river, creeks, and springs.

=== Climate ===
The San Fernando Valley has a [[subtropical_climate|subtropical]]/[[hot-summer_Mediterranean|hot-summer Mediterranean]] climate, with long, hot, dry summers, and short, warm winters, with chilly nights and sporadic rainfall. Due to its relatively inland location and other factors, summer days are typically hotter and winter nights typically colder than in the [[Los_Angeles_basin|Los Angeles basin]].

In the late 1970s, there was a proposed east-west freeway labeled SR 64 that would have cut through the center of the valley from Calabasas in the western end of the valley to the SR-170 and I-5 freeway interchange in Sun Valley, Los Angeles in the eastern end of the valley, but local opposition gained traction and the proposed freeway was never approved or built.

=== 21st century ===
;Contemporary era
By the late 1990s, the San Fernando Valley had become more urban and more ethnically diverse with rising poverty and crime. In 2002, the valley tried to secede from the city of Los Angeles and become its own incorporated city to escape Los Angeles' perceived poverty, crime, gang activity, [[urban_decay|urban decay]], and poorly maintained infrastructure. Since that unsuccessful secession attempt, a new Van Nuys municipal building was built in 2003; the Metro Orange Line opened in October 2005; 35 new public schools had opened up by 2012, and the valley's ethnic plurality is now Hispanic, edging out its white population by 0.8 percent.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

By 2017, numerous urban development projects began in the valley, mainly in the Los Angeles neighborhoods of North Hollywood, Panorama City, and Woodland Hills. These projects started with the first few in Woodland Hills and the NoHo West project in North Hollywood began groundbreaking and construction on April 6, 2017.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

LA Metro will begin construction on upgrades of the Metro G Line in 2021 with at-grade crossing gates and two bridges crossing both Sepulveda and Van Nuys Boulevards. The valley will get its first light rail line in seven decades by 2027, with construction of the line beginning in 2021 along Van Nuys Boulevard and San Fernando Road.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}

The Paul Thomas Anderson film, ''[[Boogie_Nights|Boogie Nights]]'' explores these aspects of the valley. According to the HBO series ''[[Pornucopia|Pornucopia]]'', at one time, nearly 90 percent of all legally distributed pornographic films made in the United States were either filmed in or produced by studios based in the San Fernando Valley.
The pornography industry began to decline by the mid-2000s, owing, for the most part, to the growing amount of free content on the Internet, which undercut consumers' willingness to pay. In 2007 industry insiders estimated that revenue for most adult production and distribution companies had declined 30 percent to 50 percent and the number of new films made had fallen sharply.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/10/business/fi-ct-porn10| title=Tough times in the porn industry| access-date=August 8, 2012| date=August 10, 2009| first1=Ben| last1=Fritz| work=Los Angeles Times| archive-date=2018-10-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020034601/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/aug/10/business/fi-ct-porn10| dead-url=no}}</ref>

=== Rapid transit ===
[[Rapid_transit|Subway]], [[bus_rapid_transit|dedicated transitway]], and express and local buses, provided by many agencies, serve the San Fernando Valley. Some of the former [[Right-of-way_(transportation)|rights-of-way]] of the [[Pacific_Electric_Railway|Pacific Electric Railway]], which first accelerated population growth in the Valley,<ref name="Gumprecht2001">{{cite book| author=Blake Gumprecht| title=The Los Angeles River: Its Life, Death, and Possible Rebirth| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ftBJpp7aIoC&pg=PA118| access-date=9 August 2012| date=1 March 2001| publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press| isbn=978-0-8018-6642-5| page=118| archive-date=2016-06-03| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603054338/https://books.google.com/books?id=2ftBJpp7aIoC&pg=PA118| dead-url=no}}</ref> have been repurposed for busways and light rail lines.

The [[Los_Angeles_County_Metropolitan_Transportation_Authority|Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] operates two [[B_Line_(Los_Angeles_Metro)|Metro B Line]] subway stations in the Valley, which are located at [[Universal_City,_California|Universal City]] and North Hollywood, which connect it directly to [[Hollywood|Hollywood]] and [[Downtown_Los_Angeles|Downtown Los Angeles]]. The Metro B Line is the first heavy rail subway in the valley, extended from its prior terminus in 2000. With transfers, it connects the Valley to the entire [[Los_Angeles_Metro_Rail|Metro regional light rail and subway network]]. The B Line's two Valley subway stations provide access to national travel through [[Bob_Hope_Airport|Bob Hope Airport]] and [[Amtrak|Amtrak]] and regional travel through [[Metrolink_(Southern_California)|Metrolink]], [[Metro_Rapid|Metro Rapid]], [[Metro_Local|Metro Local]], and the [[G_Line_(Los_Angeles_Metro)|Metro G Line]]. Metro approved a new light rail line, the [[East_San_Fernando_Valley_Transit_Corridor|East San Fernando Valley Transit Corridor]]. A new north–south light rail line on Van Nuys Boulevard from the G Line Van Nuys Station is planned. Construction is set to begin in 2021 with a completion date of 2027.

The G Line busway uses a dedicated transitway route running the east–west length of the Valley connecting the [[North_Hollywood_(Los_Angeles_Metro_station)|North Hollywood B Line Station]] to the [[Warner_Center_Transit_Hub|Warner Center Transit Hub]] in [[Woodland_Hills,_Los_Angeles|Woodland Hills]] and then heads north through [[Canoga_Park,_Los_Angeles|Canoga Park]] to the [[Chatsworth,_Los_Angeles|Chatsworth]] [[Metrolink_(Southern_California)|Metrolink]] train station.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.metro.net/projects/orangeline/| title=Orangeline Extension| publisher=metro.net| access-date=August 9, 2012| archive-date=2012-08-08| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808062731/http://www.metro.net/projects/orangeline/| dead-url=no}}</ref>

Two additional Metro Busway lines are planned for the Valley operating from North Hollywood station: the [[North_Hollywood–Pasadena_Transit_Line|North Hollywood–Pasadena Transit Line]] which will run to Pasadena with connections to the [[L_Line_(Los_Angeles_Metro)|L Line]], and the [[North_San_Fernando_Valley_Transit_Corridor|North San Fernando Valley Transit Corridor]] which will provide additional east-west services complimenting the G Line. Metro is also studying a route through the [[Sepulveda_Pass|Sepulveda Pass]], the [[Sepulveda_Pass_Transit_Corridor|Sepulveda Pass Transit Corridor]], including heavy rail and [[monorail|monorail]] alternatives.

=== Rail and air ===
[[Metrolink_(Southern_California)|Metrolink]] [[commuter_rail|commuter rail]] has two Valley lines, the [[Antelope_Valley_Line|Antelope Valley Line]] and [[Ventura_County_Line|Ventura County Line]], which connect the Valley and beyond to downtown Los Angeles and south, becoming one line at the [[Downtown_Burbank_station|Downtown Burbank station]]. Metrolink always had one Burbank Airport station on the Ventura County Line, but a second Burbank Airport station was built in 2017 on the Antelope Valley Line.

[[Amtrak|Amtrak]]'s ''[[Pacific_Surfliner|Pacific Surfliner]]'' long-distance rail line has stops at [[Burbank–Bob_Hope_Airport_(Metrolink_station)|Burbank Airport station]], Van Nuys, and [[Chatsworth_Station|Chatsworth Station]], before proceeding on to [[Ventura_County,_California|Ventura County]], [[Santa_Barbara,_California|Santa Barbara]], and [[Northern_California|Northern California]] or [[Union_Station_(Los_Angeles)|Union Station]] and [[San_Diego|San Diego]].

The [[California_High-Speed_Rail_Authority|California High-Speed Rail Authority]] was planning two stations in the Valley, one in [[Burbank,_California|Burbank]] and the other in [[Sylmar,_Los_Angeles|Sylmar]], but the proposed Sylmar high-speed rail station was canceled owing to local opposition from the city of San Fernando. As of now, there's only one planned station in the valley, located in Burbank with an initial section of the railroad possibly opening in 2029.

The Valley's two major airports are [[Hollywood_Burbank_Airport|Hollywood Burbank Airport]] and the [[Van_Nuys_Airport|Van Nuys Airport]]. The Van Nuys–Airport FlyAway Terminal provides nonstop scheduled shuttle service to LAX and back to the valley, with parking.

=== Independence movements ===
The Valley attempted to secede in the 1970s, but the state passed a law barring city formation without the approval of the City Council. In 1997, Assemblymen [[Robert_Hertzberg|Bob Hertzberg]] and [[Tom_McClintock|Tom McClintock]] helped pass a bill that would make it easier for the Valley to secede by removing the City Council veto. AB 62 was signed into law by Governor [[Pete_Wilson|Pete Wilson]]. Meanwhile, a grassroots movement to split the [[Los_Angeles_Unified_School_District|Los Angeles Unified School District]] (LAUSD) and create new San Fernando Valley-based school districts became the focal point of the desire to leave the city. Though the state rejected the idea of Valley-based districts, it remained an important rallying point for Hertzberg's mayoral campaign, which proved unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/29/us/los-angeles-long-fragmented-faces-threat-of-secession-by-the-sanfernando-valley.html |title=Los Angeles, Long Fragmented, Faces Threat of Secession by the San Fernando Valley |newspaper=[[The_New_York_Times|The New York Times]] |first=B.

;Measure F

In 2002, the San Fernando Valley portion of Los Angeles again seriously campaigned to [[secession|secede]] from the rest of the city and become its own new independent and incorporated city. The movement gained some momentum, but measure F did not receive the necessary votes to pass. There were multiple name choices for the new city. "Valley City" was the chosen name for the new city. Among the proposed names for the new city were "Mission Valley", "Rancho San Fernando", "Camelot", or "Townsville".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/cnos/urba/csun_urb_vote_oac.pdf |title=Guide to the Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment Collection |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2012 |publisher=Online Archive of California |access-date=September 17, 2020 |archive-date=2021-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211128060307/http://pdf.oac.cdlib.org/pdf/cnos/urba/csun_urb_vote_oac.pdf |dead-url=no }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kahn |first=Joseph |date=April 20, 2002 |title=San Fernando Valley Looks To a Life After Los Angeles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/20/us/san-fernando-valley-looks-to-a-life-after-los-angeles.html |work=[[The_New_York_Times|The New York Times]] |access-date=September 17, 2020 |archive-date=2022-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220120140818/https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/20/us/san-fernando-valley-looks-to-a-life-after-los-angeles.html |dead-url=no }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Sauerwein |first=Kristina |date=March 18, 2003 |title=Champion of Valley Secession Passes Control to New Leader |work=Los Angeles Times }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=It's Right on the Tip of Their Tongues; Secession: Residents of Valley and harbor area narrow list of possible names |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 3, 2002 }}</ref>

The NoHo Arts District was established and the name chosen as a reference for its location in North Hollywood and as a play off New York City's arts-centered [[SoHo|SoHo]] District. According to the ''San Fernando Guide'', the change helped develop a "primarily lower to middle-class suburb into … a collection of art and a home for the artists who ply their trade in the galleries, theaters and dance studios in this small annex."<ref>{{cite web| title=San Fernando Valley Neighborhoods| url=http://sanfernandoguide.com/neighborhoods/noho-arts-district| work=San Fernando Valley Guide| access-date=June 20, 2013| archive-date=2013-02-11| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211174952/http://sanfernandoguide.com/neighborhoods/noho-arts-district/| dead-url=no}}</ref>

According to the Lake Balboa Neighborhood Council, from 2002 through November 2007 there was a debate about the official recognition of [[Lake_Balboa,_Los_Angeles|Lake Balboa]] as a community by the City of Los Angeles. New community names were not sanctioned by the city until January 2006, when the city adopted a formal community-naming process (City of Los Angeles Council File Number 02 -0196). On November 2, 2007, the City Council of Los Angeles approved a motion renaming a larger portion of Van Nuys to Lake Balboa.<ref>{{cite web| title=Lake Balboa Neighborhood Council Newsletter| url=http://lakebalboanc.org/newsletters/LBNCAprilNumber2.pdf| website=Lakebalboanc.org| access-date=June 21, 2013| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812030704/http://lakebalboanc.org/newsletters/LBNCAprilNumber2.pdf| archive-date=August 12, 2014| url-status=dead}}</ref>

As of 2012 the population of the San Fernando Valley was 1.77 million, of which 41.8 percent were [[Hispanic_and_Latino_Americans|Hispanic or Latino]], 41.0 percent were [[Non-Hispanic_Whites|non-Hispanic white]], 12.7 percent were [[Asian_American|Asian]] and 4.6 percent were [[African_American|African American]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_DP05&prodType=table|archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212210916/http://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_12_5YR_DP05&prodType=table|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 12, 2020|publisher=census.gov|title=American Fact-Finder results for San Fernando Valley CCD, Los Angeles County, California|access-date=January 25, 2014}}</ref> The largest city located entirely in the valley is [[Burbank,_California|Burbank]], with over 107,000 residents. The most populous districts of Los Angeles in the Valley are [[Van_Nuys,_Los_Angeles|Van Nuys]] and [[Pacoima,_Los_Angeles|Pacoima]], which like the city of [[Burbank,_California|Burbank]] have more than 100,000 residents each. Despite the San Fernando Valley's reputation for sprawling, low-density development, the valley communities of [[Panorama_City,_Los_Angeles|Panorama City]], North Hollywood, Van Nuys, [[Reseda,_Los_Angeles|Reseda]], [[Canoga_Park,_Los_Angeles|Canoga Park]], and [[Northridge,_Los_Angeles|Northridge]], all in Los Angeles, have numerous apartment complexes and contain some of the densest census tracts in Los Angeles.

The San Fernando Valley has a significant population below the poverty level. About 30 percent of Valley households in 2009 earned less than $35,000 a year, including 10 percent who made less than $15,000 a year.<ref>{{cite news| title=Record numbers of poor in nation – with more in San Fernando Valley seeking assistance| url=http://www.dailynews.com/20110914/record-numbers-of-poor-in-nation-with-more-in-san-fernando-valley-seeking-assistance| newspaper=[[Los_Angeles_Daily_News|Los Angeles Daily News]]| access-date=December 18, 2013| archive-date=2013-12-19| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219010024/http://www.dailynews.com/20110914/record-numbers-of-poor-in-nation-with-more-in-san-fernando-valley-seeking-assistance| dead-url=no}}</ref>
The Pacoima district, once considered the hub of suburban blight and of having the highest poverty rate, is no longer such. Other San Fernando Valley neighborhoods such as North Hollywood, Panorama City, and Arleta now have poverty rates which are higher.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zipatlas.com/us/ca/city-comparison/population-below-poverty-level.6.htm|title=Percentage of Population Below Poverty Level in California by City|first=ZipAtlas.com Development|last=Team|website=Zipatlas.com|access-date=13 October 2017|archive-date=2011-06-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628014018/http://zipatlas.com/us/ca/city-comparison/population-below-poverty-level.6.htm|dead-url=no}}</ref>
 
In general, the areas with lower poverty rates have become fewer and more scattered, while many of the now affluent communities have become compartmented, having their own private, planned and gated communities. Many of these tend to be on or near the borders of the Valley in the foothill regions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/poverty/poverty-San-Fernando-California.html|title=San Fernando, California (CA) poverty rate data - information about poor and low income residents living in this city|website=City-data.com|access-date=13 October 2017|archive-date=2013-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219055624/http://www.city-data.com/poverty/poverty-San-Fernando-California.html|dead-url=no}}</ref>
