{{Bible|但以理书|8}}记载[[新巴比倫王國|新巴比倫王國]]国王[[伯沙撒|伯沙撒]]在位第三年，[[但以理|但以理]]看到[[异象|异象]]。
<!-- 20 years after the one in chapter 7 and apparently just before Belshazzar is killed in chapter 5. -->

==异象==
但以理在异象中看见自己在[[以攔|以拦省]][[书珊城|书珊城]]中[[乌莱河边|乌莱河边]]，见有一只双角的公[[绵羊|绵羊]]面向河站着，一角高过另一角，更高的是后长出来的。见那公绵羊往西、往北、往南抵触；兽在他面前都站立不住，他任意而行，渐渐强大。突然有一只公[[山羊|山羊]]从西而来，遍行全地，脚不触地；这山羊两眼之间，有一显著的角。山羊往那双角的公绵羊直闯，折断他的两角；绵羊无力抵挡，被撞倒在地，用脚践踏。

正当这山羊极其强盛的时候，那大角折断了，在角根上向天的四方，长出四个显著的角来。四角之中，有一角长出一个小角，向南、向东、向[[荣美之地|荣美之地]]，渐渐强大，高及天象，将些天象和星宿抛落在地，用脚践踏。并且以为高及天象之君；祂日常的祭祀从祂除掉，祂的[[聖殿|聖所]]被毁坏。因过犯的缘故，有军兵和日常的祭祀交付与他；他将真理抛在地上。

有一位圣者问另一位圣者说，“这除掉日常祭祀，和造成荒凉的过犯，以致圣所与军兵遭践踏的异象，要持续多久呢？”他回答说，到2300个日夜，圣所就必得洁净。<ref>{{Bible|但以理书|8|3-14}}</ref>

<!-- ==Parallel Paraphrase of the Dream and Interpretation==
The following illustration is a paraphrase of Chapter 8 of Daniel. (Words in bold font indicate parallel phrases.  Colors demarcate the different kingdoms.) -->

==解释==
[[天使|天使]][[加百列|加百列]]向但以理解释绵羊与山羊的异象。  

双角的公绵羊，就是[[阿契美尼德王朝|瑪代波斯]]，一角高过另一角。它往西、往北、往南征服，任意而行，渐渐强大。 

从西方而来、脚不触地的公山羊代表[[希臘|希臘]]；希腊愤怒的责备玛代波斯，折断他的两角，将他撞倒在地，用脚践踏。但就在希腊权势的顶峰，牠两眼之间的大角，[[亞歷山大大帝|亞歷山大大帝]]病逝，[[继业者战争|帝國分裂]]為四部分。

<!-- Then an unidentified king, a stern-faced master of intrigue, comes on the scene.  He starts small but will become very strong, yet not by his own power.  He will cause astounding devastation and will succeed in whatever he does.  He will cause deceit to prosper.  When they feel secure, he will destroy many.

He will grow to the south, then east and toward the "beautiful land" and destroy the mighty men and the holy people.  He will consider himself superior to the "hosts of heaven' and claim to be as great as and take his stand against the "Prince of the princes."

He steals the 'daily sacrifice' and denigrates the "sanctuary" of the "Prince of hosts"  The saints and sacrifice are put under his tyrany and truth is thrown down.

Yet he will be destroyed, but not by human power.

Someone askes about how long that part of the vision that deals with the daily sacrifice, the rebellion, the surrender of the sanctuary and the host would last.  It was to last 2300 "evening and mornings."

After that, the sanctuary, which had been debased and soiled, would be cleansed and reconsecrated. -->

<!-- ==Proposed Identifications of the Kingdoms==
In the previous two visions, the first kingdom is identified as the existing realm at the time of the vision, i.e. Babylon.  This vision occurred during the reign of Babylon's Belshazzar, but its first kingdom, the ''ram'', is identified as Media-Persia.  This is probably because Babylon was soon to fall to Cyrus the Great of Media as recorded in the account of Chapter 5.

The ''Goat'' kingdom is identified as the kingdom of Greece.

Just as some Christian Theologians since the 2nd Century have considered the [[Daniel_Prophecy_Literary_Parallels|visions of Chapter 2 and 7 parallel]], so too, Chapter 8 was considered [[Daniel_Prophecy_Literary_Parallels#Daniel_8_parallel_with_Chapters_2_.26_7|parallel with the other two]]. -->

<!-- ==Principles of Interpretation==
Principles of interpretations are rules for interpreting Bible prophecies that are adopted either from direct explanation or derived from examples. 

===Beasts represent kingdoms===
This principle comes from direct explanation:

* The two-horned ram that you saw represents the kings of Media and Persia. verse 20

* The shaggy goat is the king of Greece.  verse 21

Note that the earliest (pre-[[Theodotion|Theodotion]]) Greek versions and the [[Qumran|Qumran]] edition read "kingdom" at several points where Theodotion and the later Masoretic traditions have "king".

This same principle is also found in [[Daniel's_Vision_of_Chapter_7#Beasts_represent_kingdoms|Chapter 7]]. -->

<!-- ===An animal's horn represents a king or kingdom===
This principle is derived from examples rather than by direct statement.  

Three examples are given.  

* the large horn ... is the first king.   verse 21

* The four horns ... represent four kingdoms...   verse 22

* Out of one of them came another horn...  verse 9
and
* In the latter part of their reign ... a stern-faced king ... will arise. verse 23

This same principle is also found in [[Daniel's_Vision_of_Chapter_7#Animal_horns_in_symbol_represent_kings|Chapter 7]]. -->
