{{Bible|但以理书|7}}记载了“'''四獸的異象'''”。  

[[巴比伦王国|巴比伦王国]]国王[[伯沙撒|伯沙撒]]元年的一个夜晚，但以理看见了一个异象，引起他极大的关注。但以理向其他人描述這個異象，以及在夢中向他講解這個夢的人所解說的這個異象的意義。

==梦==
但以理看见天的四风陡起，刮在大海之上。有四个大兽从海中上来： 
# 长有鹰翅的狮子， 
# 口中衔着三根肋骨的熊， 
# 有四个头、四个翅膀的豹， 
# 极其强壮可怕的第四兽，有大铁牙，吞吃嚼碎，所剩下的用脚践踏。
<!-- Then the court of the [[Ancient_of_Days|Ancient of Days]] is held, books are opened and judgment pronounced in favor of the saints.  The fourth remaining beast is destroyed.  The “son of man” is given an everlasting dominion, which is then given over to the saints --> 

但以理问一位侍立者这一切的准确意义，他就告诉但以理，这四个大兽就是将要在地上兴起的四國。 
<!-- fourth beast and the horns especially intrigue Daniel.  He is then told further interpretation about the 4th beast. -->

<!-- ==Literary Structure of Vision==

Arthur Ferch<ref>Ferch, Arthur J., 1988, ''Daniel on Solid Ground'', Review and Herald Publishing Assoc., p. 27</ref> points out that the vision forms a [[chiasm|chiasm]].

<!-- ==Parallel Paraphrase of the Dream and Interpretation==
The following illustration is a paraphrase of Chapter 7 of Daniel.  (Words in bold font indicate parallel phrases.  Colors demarcate the different kingdoms.)

==Synthesis of the Dream and Interpretation==

First beast:  A lion with eagle’s wings, has its wings torn off.  It is then stood up on two feet and given a man’s heart.

Second beast:  A bear, raised up on one side, has three ribs in its teeth.  He is told to gorge himself of flesh.

Third beast:  A leopard with four wings and four heads is given authority to rule.

Fourth beast:  A terrifying, powerful, nondescript beast, unlike any other, crushes and devours the whole earth with its iron teeth—trampling it down.  Ten kingdoms will come out of this kingdom.  Then a different sort of horn uproots 3 of the former kingdoms.  It boasts against the Most High trying to change set times and laws.  He will oppress the saints for a time, times and half a time (or a year, two years, and half a year – 3.5 years)

After that time the Ancient of Days sets up court, opens the books and pronounces judgment in favor of the saint.

Then the 4th beast will have his power taken away and be destroyed in fire.

Then  the ‘son of man’ comes in the clouds of heaven.  The Ancient of Days gives him an everlasting dominion which he hands over to the saints.  All rulers will worship and obey him.

==Proposed Identifications of the Kingdoms==
Unlike [[Nebuchadnezzar's_statue_vision_in_Daniel_2|Nebuchadnezzar’s dream in chapter 2]] where the head of Gold is identified as Nebuchadnezzar and Babylonia, none of the beasts is identified in this vision.  Of the four beasts, only the 4th beast and its horn are interpreted.

While no beast is clearly identified in this interpretation, some Christian theologians ever since the second century have connected the [[Daniel_Prophecy_Literary_Parallels|eagle winged lion with Nebuchadnezzar's Babylonia]], a matter still open to considerable debate.

==翻译的原则==
Principles of interpretations are rules for interpreting Bible prophecies that are adopted either from direct explanation or derived from examples. --> 

<!-- ===兽代表王国===
This principle comes from a direct explanation.  An angel explains:

* "The four great beasts are four kingdoms that will rise from the earth." verse 17.

This same principle is also found in [[Daniel's_Vision_of_Chapter_8#Beasts_represent_kingdoms|Chapter 8]].

===Animal horns in symbol represent kings===
This principle is derived from examples rather than by direct statement.  The three examples are found by parallel paraphrase.  The vision is put beside it's interpretation.

* "and it had ten horns" (verse 7), "the ten horns are ten kings" (verse 24)

* "there before me was another horn" (verse 8), "After them another king" (verse 24)

* "three of the first horns were uprooted before it" (verse 8), "he will subdue three kings" (verse 24)

This same principle is also found in [[Daniel's_Vision_of_Chapter_8#An_animal.27s_horn_represents_a_king_or_kingdom|Chapter 8]]. -->
