在哲学中，'''道德相对主义'''是一种立场，认为[[道德|道德]]或[[伦理|伦理]]并不反映客观或普遍的道德真理，而主张[[社会|社会]]、[[文化|文化]]、[[历史|历史]]或个人境遇的[[相对主义|相对主义]]。道德相对主义者与[[道德普遍主义|道德普遍主义]]相反，坚持不存在评价伦理道德的普遍标准。相对主义立场认为道德价值只适用于特定文化边界内，或个人选择的前后关系。极端的相对主义立场提议其他个人或团体的道德判断或行为没有任何意义。 

一些道德相对主义者，例如[[存在主义|存在主义]]者[[让-保罗·萨特|让-保罗·萨特]]坚持个人的、主观的“道德核心”（moral core）应该成为个体道德行为的基础。公共道德反映社会[[习俗|习俗]]，只有个人的、主观的道德表达真正的[[本真|本真]]（Authenticity）。
<!-- 道德相对主义不同于 [[Value_pluralism|moral pluralism]] — which acknowledges the co-existence of opposing ideas and practices, but accepts limits to differences, such as when vital human needs get violated.道德相对主义, in contrast, grants 道德判断的可能性 that do not accept such limits.  -->
<!-- 在通俗文化中，人们经常将自己描述为“道德相对主义者”，表明他们接受其他人的价值，赞成没有一个"right" way of doing some things. However, this actually has little to do with the philosophical idea of relativism; relativism does not necessarily imply tolerance, just as moral objectivism does not imply intolerance. These people's moral outlook can be explained from both theoretical frameworks. -->

== 历史 ==
<!-- Commentators may describe relativism as a temporal idea of the "new" that conflicts with objective moral standards supplied by tradition. Moral relativism, however, encompasses views and arguments that people in some cultures have held for a very long time, such as the ancient [[Jaina|Jaina]] [[Anekantavada|Anekantavada]] principle of [[Mahavira|Mahavira]] (c. 599 – 527 BC) and the ancient [[Taoist|Taoist]] writings of [[Chuang_Tzu|Chuang Tzu]] (4th century BC). --> 
<!-- History records relativist positions over several thousand years. The assertion by [[Protagoras|Protagoras]] (c. 481 – 420 BC) that "man is the measure of all things" provides an early philosophical precursor to modern relativism. The Greek historian [[Herodotus|Herodotus]] (c. 484 – 420 BC) observed that each society regards its own belief system and way of doing things as the best, in contrast to that of others. Various ancient philosophers also questioned the idea of an objective standard of morality.
In the early modern era, [[Benedict_Spinoza|Benedict Spinoza]] (1632-1677) notably held that nothing is inherently good or evil.  The 18th-century Enlightenment philosopher [[David_Hume|David Hume]] (1711 - 1776) serves in several important respects as the father both of modern [[emotivism|emotivism]] and of moral relativism, though Hume himself did not espouse relativism. He distinguished between matters of fact and matters of value, and suggested that moral judgments consist of the latter, for they do not deal with verifiable facts obtained in the world, but only with our sentiments and passions. But Hume regarded some of our sentiments as universal. He famously denied that morality has any objective standard, and suggested that the universe remains indifferent to our preferences and our troubles. -->
<!-- In the modern era, anthropologists such as [[Ruth_Benedict|Ruth Benedict]] (1887 – 1948) cautioned observers against [[ethnocentricism|ethnocentricism]] — using the standards of their own culture to evaluate their subjects of study. Benedict said that morals do not exist — only customs do; and that in comparing customs, the anthropologist "insofar as he remains an anthropologist . . . is bound to avoid any weighting of one in favor of the other". To some extent, the increasing body of knowledge of great differences in belief among societies caused both social scientists and philosophers to question whether any objective, absolute standards pertaining to values could exist. This led some to posit that differing systems have equal validity, with no standard for adjudicating among conflicting beliefs. The Finnish philosopher-anthropologist [[Edward_Westermarck|Edward Westermarck]] (1862 – 1939) ranks as one of the first to formulate a detailed theory of moral relativism. He portrayed all moral ideas as subjective judgments that reflect one's upbringing. He rejected [[G.E._Moore|G.E. Moore]]'s (1873 – 1958) [[ethical_intuitionism|ethical intuitionism]] — in vogue during the early part of the 20th century, and which identified moral propositions as true or false, and known to us through a special faculty of intuition — because of the obvious differences in beliefs among societies, which he said provided evidence of the lack of any innate, intuitive power. -->

== 哲学观点 ==
道德相对主义与[[道德普遍主义|道德普遍主义]]（moral universalism）观点相对，如[[世界人权宣言|世界人权宣言]]就是道德普遍主义实践。同时道德相对主义与道德客观主义（moral objectivism）、道德现实主义（moral realism）和道德自然主义（moral naturalism）相区别。<!-- which all 主张道德的存在 fact: facts that entities can both know and judge, whether through some process of verification or through intuition. An example 包括[[让-雅克·卢梭|让-雅克·卢梭]] (1712 – 1778)的哲学, who saw man's nature as inherently good. Other moral objectivist believe that humankind can derive moral knowledge from external sources such as a deity or [[revelation|reveal]]ed doctrines. Some hold that moral facts inhere in [[nature|nature]] or [[reality|reality]]. In each case, however, moral facts remain invariant, though the circumstances to which they apply may differ. Moreover, each of these schools of thought sees moral facts as objective and determinable.

道德相对主义rejects the idea of an objective morality, but its proponents do not all agree as to the nature of morality. -->
<!-- === Descriptive relativism===  
So-called [[descriptive_relativism|descriptive relativist]]s (for example, [[Ralph_Barton_Perry|Ralph Barton Perry]] [1876 - 1957]) accept the existence of fundamental disagreements about the right course of action even when the same facts obtain and the same consequences seem likely to arise. However, the descriptive relativist does not necessarily deny the existence of a single correct moral appraisal, given the same set of circumstances. Other descriptivists believe that opposing moral beliefs can both hold true simultaneously, though their critics point out that this leads to obvious logical problems. The later descriptivists (for example, several leading [[Existentialists|Existentialists]]) regard morality as entirely subjective and personal, and beyond the judgment of others. In this view moral judgments resemble aesthetic considerations and remain resistant to rational analysis. -->  
<!-- ===Meta-ethical relativism ===
[[meta-ethics|Meta-ethical]] relativists maintain that all moral judgments have their origins either in societal or in individual standards, and that no single objective standard exists by which one can assess the truth of a moral proposition. While he preferred to deal with more practical [[real_life|real-life]] ethical matters, the British philosopher [[Bernard_Williams|Bernard Williams]] (1929 – 2003) reluctantly came to this conclusion when he wrote from a meta-ethical standpoint. Meta-ethical relativists, in general, believe that the descriptive properties of terms such as "good", "bad", "right", and "wrong" do not stand subject to [[Universality_(philosophy)|universal]] [[truth|truth]] conditions, but only to societal convention and personal preference. Given the same set of verifiable facts, some societies or individuals will have a fundamental disagreement about what one ''ought'' to do based on societal or individual [[norm_(sociology)|norm]]s, and one cannot adjudicate these using some independent standard of evaluation.  The latter standard will always be societal or personal and not universal, unlike, for example, the scientific standards for assessing [[thermodynamic_temperature|temperature]] or for determining [[proof_theory|mathematical truths]]. -->

=== 相对主义与动机说 ===
<!-- Some philosophers maintain that moral relativism dissolves into [[emotivism|emotivism]], the movement inspired by [[logical_positivists|logical positivists]] in the early part of the 20th century. (Leading exponents of logical positivism include [[Rudolph_Carnap|Rudolph Carnap]] (1891 – 1970) and [[A._J._Ayer|A. J. Ayer]] (1910 – 1989).) Going beyond Hume, positivists regard a proposition as ''meaningful'' only if one can verify it by [[logic|logic]]al or scientific inquiry. Thus [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] propositions, which one cannot verify in this manner, are not simply incorrect, ''they are meaningless'', nonsensical. Moral judgments are primarily expressions of emotional preferences or states, devoid of cognitive content; consequently, they are not subject to verification. As such, moral propositions are essentially meaningless utterances or, at best, express personal attitudes (see, for example, [[Charles_L._Stevenson|Charles L. Stevenson]] [1908–1979]). Not all relativists would regard moral propositions as meaningless; indeed, many make any number of assertions about morality, assertions that they undoubtedly believe meaningful. However, other philosophers have argued that, since we have no means of analyzing a moral proposition, it is essentially meaningless, and (in their view) relativism is therefore tantamount to emotivism. 

The proposition that one cannot verify moral judgement by empirical means (and that it remains therefore meaningless) presents, according to many philosophers, a self-[[contradiction|contradiction]]. In this view, the statement, "X is meaningless if it isn't subject to verification" cannot be verified by the very criterion set forth by the proposition. -->

=== 卡尔·马克思 ===
一些人将[[卡尔·马克思|卡尔·马克思]]（1818 – 1883）作为道德相对主义的典型。他宣称每个社会的道德体系完全是其[[生产方式|生产方式]]和[[阶级结构|阶级结构]]的产物。他相信统治阶级的利益将成为社会的占优势的道德体系。<!-- How Marx viewed this sociological morality remains the subject of debate. Some argue he had a [[历史相对论|历史相对论]] view that the 历史的运动将带给社会一种真正的、最终的道德形式。Others 相信马克思 did not put much weight behind 社会道德 and that he used 其他道德标准。 -->

=== 弗里德里希·尼采 ===
<!-- {{main|Perspectivism}}-->
[[弗里德里希·尼采|弗里德里希·尼采]]认为道德是[[二元论|二元论]]概念带给人们、又由教会继续维持的一个错误思想。他一生的任务，就是重新评估所有价值，把人类思想从这些错误拯救出来。他预想未来个体将自然地行动，充分利用他们的天赋潜力或权利欲（der Wille zur Macht）。他相信人类只有通过开始自然地、本能地、根据每个个人的愿望和动力行动，才会前进，实现这潜力。Übermensch将呈现强壮、有力、自然和快乐的结果。快乐（“力量增长、阻力被克服的感觉”）将自然出现。尼采希望通过人类动力“再自然化”来准备人类成长的土壤。他相信，一旦人们摆脱道德（以及协会、宗教），下一代人将会不受污染地、自由地、强壮地成长。（见《[[善恶的彼岸|善恶的彼岸]]》、《[[偶像的黄昏|偶像的黄昏]]》、《[[反基督_(书籍)|敌基督]]》等）。

== 争论 ==
=== 其他文化 ===
<!-- Those who support positions of [[Moral_absolutism|absolutism]] often criticize moral relativism; sometimes equating it with "[[immorality|immorality]]" or [[amorality|amorality]]. They argue that various historical and cultural events and practices (including [[the_Holocaust|the Holocaust]], [[Stalinism|Stalinism]], [[Apartheid|Apartheid]] in South Africa, [[genocide|genocide]], [[Just_War_theory|unjust war]]s, [[genital_mutilation|genital mutilation]], [[slavery|slavery]], [[terrorism|terrorism]], [[Nazism|Nazism]], etc.) present difficult problems for relativists, because these acts, which are condemned by the "majority of people" everywhere, are not absolutely "bad" from a relativist perspective.
This is, in fact, exactly what moral relativism states, and there is no self-contradiction in it. But what the objectivist is pointing to is the contradiction he sees between moral relativism and the wrongness of the Holocaust, which he takes be indisputable. The relativist, in turn, can stick to his ground and insist that the Holocaust is not absolutely wrong, and that it is a matter of opinion. The argument cannot be resolved by straightforward [[logic|logic]], since each party makes assumptions the other does not share, employs different [[axioms|axioms]]. However, the validity of an assumption or axiom can itself be questioned. The point of the Holocaust argument is to urge the rightness or wrongness of some ethical claims as being more [[self-evident|self-evident]], and therefore more properly axiomatic, than the meta-ethical assumptions of relativism. Self-evidence can be criticised as somewhat subjective, but it is nonetheless widely used to select axioms in areas like 数学或逻辑学。 -->

=== 后果 ===
<!-- Some moral absolutists criticize moral relativism on the grounds that it may lead to what they would describe as "immoral acts" because it abandons an absolute standard of "right and wrong". This is a criticism directed against the consequences of relativism, and not against its truth. A common counter-criticism is that moral absolutism is as likely or more likely to lead to such "immoral acts" since a belief in absolute "right and wrong" can potentially be used to justify any number of acts that might generally be considered to be "atrocities". But by whose standards? If absolutist is correct as a meta-ethical stance, and if the absolutist has hit on the correct ethics, then what they do will ipso facto be morally right; so the counter-criticism must assume that the absolutist is wrong, at least about ethics; or, perhaps that the absolutism as a meta-ethical position would lead people to be over-confident about whether their ethical beliefs are actually true. -->
<!-- Absolutism per se does not entitle people to impose their beliefs on others; that may or may not be an objectively justifiable moral principle. Moreover, since absolutists believe there is only one correct set of moral principles, they must, if they are sincere,  be careful in selecting what they are. Absolutism as a meta-ethical claim does not therefore constitute a rubber-stamp for approving or imposing any prevailing moral code. An absolutist who attempts that kind of manoeuvre may well be in the wrong — even objectively in the wrong — by their own standards. On the other hand, relativists are ''required'' to relativistically justify prevailing (personal or social) standards. So it can be argued that the counter-criticism compares a ''misuse'' of absolutism with a normal use of relativism, or that relativism addresses something common to human nature that absolutists ignore at their peril. -->
<!-- ===Defending relativism===
Another critique of moral relativism which falls into this category postulates that anyone who claims that no moral absolutes exist undermines their ability to justify their own existence. According to this argument, if a moral relativist is intellectually honest, they have no right to claim that they should remain unharmed by other individuals who adhere to a subjectively determined or culturally-bound moral theory which does not regard causing harm to others, or at least moral relativists, as wrong. In this sense, it is difficult for a moral relativist to hold that they have a right to exist (and in doing so, formulate their own set of moral values) in the first place. Just as they are unable to argue that slavery, the Holocaust, etc. are ultimately immoral, moral relativists are unable to argue that the discontinuation of their own lives at the hands of another individual (who adheres to a different set of values) would be ultimately immoral, either. They can claim that it is wrong in the sense of being against their moral code, but what is important here is the behaviour of the attacker; there is no reason why their attacker should be swayed by someone else's personal or cultural beliefs. In this sense, it is argued, moral relativism suffers from its inability to defend itself. This however doesn't imply that moral relativism is wrong, only more difficult with regards to dealing with 'nihilism'. -->
<!-- ===Intervention and inaction===

A related criticism, in the sense that it essentially attacks relativism for being too weak, is that relativists cannot justify intervening in other cultures' practices, since that would be "to impose their own morality". In fact, this objection cannot be applied to all relativists, since not all hold non-imposition as a basic tenet. (Likewise, not all absolutists reject the principle. There is no obvious contradiction in the claim that "it is absolutely wrong to impose ones morality on others"). However, those who do hold to non-intervention as a primary virtue have to accept the criticism that they may be culpably unwilling to resist evil in some cases — cases which moral absolutists would call evil, and which they too might call evil if it occurred in their own society. -->
<!-- ===Argument from intolerance=== -->
<!-- A further counter-criticism might be that moral absolutism is as likely or more likely to lead to such "immoral acts" since a belief in absolute "right and wrong" can potentially be used to justify any number of acts that might generally be considered to be "atrocities". For example, many people ("Joan of Arc" being a prominent example) were burned to death in Europe during the second millennium simply because they disbelieved in the religion of the prevailing monarch, and this disbelief was held to be absolutely wrong and deserving of execution; few people today would accept this as being correct, and this fact supports the argument that it is difficult to demonstrate that the consequences of believing in moral absolutism or objectivism are necessarily less "immoral" than the consequences of believing in moral relativism. -->
<!-- However, this line of argument needs to show that moral objectivists necessarily hold that they have the right to impose their views on others. There is no obvious reason why this should be the case. It is quite conceivable that they could hold the ''opposite'' to be the case — that is objectively ''wrong'' to impose ones morality on others. A moral objectivist who is only interested in defending objectivism as a ''meta-ethical'' position could simply choose to favor tolerance in order to evade the criticism. Of course one could also argue that any position of tolerance for 'what is wrong' from the point of view of objectivism is simply moral weakness, which brings back the problem of imposing morality. -->

=== Moral improvement and innovation ===
<!-- Many people in other times and places thought slavery, for example, acceptable, even good; while most [[as_of_2006|today]] view it as a great evil. Many writers and thinkers have held that one can justify any number of evils based on subjective or cultural preferences, and that morality requires some universal standard against which to measure ethical judgments. A moral relativist might respond that this criticism is only valid if one already accepts that such acts are indeed fundamentally evil - a position which the moral relativist would deny - and that the objection is therefore nothing other than an uncritical statement that morals are in fact [[Moral_absolutism|absolute]]. -->
<!-- However, if it is ''their'' society that has, for instance, rejected slavery, they presumably agree that it is wrong, if their position is one of social or cultural moral relativism. This presents a meta-ethical problem in explaining what happens when a society has a collective change of heart. Consider the case of someone who has minority moral views within their society, and yet is vindicated (even relativistically) by future developments. If "right" and "wrong" literally mean "what my society accepts/rejects" then a social moral relativist in a slave-owning society of the past who says "slavery is wrong" is effectively saying "slavery is not approved of by my society", which is false — ''factually'' false. Yet, the relativist of the present is committed to agreeing with the relativist of the past, since they both oppose slavery.

The argument was phrased in terms of cultural relativism, but a similar argument applies to subjectivism. It is difficult for a moral subjectivist to claim that they have undergone any personal moral improvement, or that an attitude they used hold was wrong, when it was obviously what they felt was right at the time. For them, there is no external standard to judge against, so while their attitudes change, they cannot be said to improve or decline. It therefore seems that there is a difference in what can be expressed or justified between an objectivist and a relativist, although whether it involves the loss of anything worthwhile is open to debate. -->
<!-- ===Drawing boundaries===

There are also difficulties in putting a boundary upon "society" or "culture" - what people feel to be their social or cultural groupings may well not align with legal and national groupings. The person holding "minority moral views within their society" may consider their "culture" more aligned with that minority than with the larger state or national society which determines what is lawfully acceptable,. This can be seen, for instance, where religious communities within a nation or state hold views on the morality of issues such as abortion or homosexuality which differ from the current legal position on those issues. This flexibility could lead to the objection that cultural moral relativism is "anything goes", since one could find — or found — a society that condones whatever one wishes to do.

The equivalent of such [[gerrymandering|gerrymandering]] in subjective or personal moral relativism would be for an individual to adopt different principles at different times, which would lead to a very acute form of "anything goes", unless forestalled by a meta-ethical principles that individuals need to be self-consistent. It could be argued that jumping ship in this way is dishonest, but the ethical acceptability of honesty is presumably as relative as anything else if relativism is true. -->

=== 元伦理学 ===
<!-- Some relativists regard this as an unfair criticism of relativism; they argue that this approach actually becomes a [[descriptive|descriptive]], or [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]], theory and not a [[normative|normative]] one; and that relativists may have strong moral beliefs, notwithstanding their foundational position. Critics of this view, however, see it as disingenuous, and argue that the relativists do not merely make meta-ethical observations. These critics contend that stating there is no preferred standard of truth, or that standards are equally true, addresses the ultimate validity and truth of the ethical judgments themselves, which, they contend, consists of a normative judgment. In other words, the separation between meta-ethics and normative ethics arguably becomes a [[distinction|distinction]] without a [[difference|difference]]. Relativists, however, would regard the notion that no preferred standard of truth exists as a [[straw_man|straw man]] argument. [[Richard_Rorty|Richard Rorty]] (1931 - 2007), for example, argued that relativist philosophers believe "that the grounds for choosing between such opinions is less algorithmic than had been thought", but not that any belief is equally as valid as any other.<ref>{{cite book | last=Rorty | first=Richard | title=Consequences of Pragmatism | location=Minneapolis | publisher=University of Minnesota Press | year=1982 | id=ISBN 0-8166-1064-9 }}</ref> -->
元伦理学（英语：meta-ethics）是伦理学的一个分支，以伦理学本身作为其研究对象。元伦理学起源于20世纪初，乔治·爱德华·摩尔于1903年发表的《伦理学原理》宣告了元伦理学的诞生。之后，元伦理学取代了实践伦理学和规范伦理学成为了西方伦理学的主流，直至1970年代为止。[1]

现代元伦理学有各种不同的流派。包括以乔治·爱德华·摩尔、哈罗德·亚瑟·普里查德（Harold Arthur Prichard）、W·D·罗斯（W. D. Ross）等为代表的直觉主义；以伯特兰·罗素、路德维希·维特根斯坦、维也纳学派等为代表的情感主义；还有以斯蒂芬·图尔敏（Stephen Toulmin）、R·M·黑尔（R. M. Hare）等为代表的规定主义。

=== R. M. Hare ===
<!-- Some philosophers, for example [[R._M._Hare|R. M. Hare]] ([[1919|1919]] – [[2002|2002]]), argue that moral propositions remain subject to logical rules, notwithstanding the absence of any factual content, including those subject to cultural or religious standards or norms. Thus, for example, they contend that one cannot hold contradictory ethical judgments. This allows for moral [[discourse|discourse]] with shared standards, notwithstanding the descriptive properties or [[truth_condition|truth condition]]s of moral terms. They do not affirm or deny that moral facts exist, only that logic applies to our moral assertions; consequently, they postulate an objective and preferred standard of moral justification, albeit in a very limited sense. Nevertheless, according to Hare, logic shows the error of relativism in one very important sense (see Hare's ''Sorting out Ethics''). Hare and other philosophers also point out that, aside from logical constraints, all systems treat certain moral terms alike in an evaluative sense. This parallels our treatment of other terms such as ''less'' or ''more'', which meet with universal understanding and do not depend upon independent standards (for example, one can convert measurements). It applies to good and  bad when used in their non-moral sense, too; for example, when we say, "this is a ''good'' wrench" or "this is a ''bad'' wheel". This evaluative property of certain terms also allows people of different beliefs to have meaningful discussions on moral questions, even though they may disagree about certain "facts". -->
<!-- === Is relativism really nihilism? ===

Another family of criticisms aim to show that relativism is not really a positive moral theory at all: that it falls short of certain criteria its proponents believe any moral theory must fulfill. These criteria may include:
* Any moral theory must be [[normative|normative]]. Descriptive relativism is not normative, so it is not a moral theory (other than an [[error_theory|error theory]]).
* Morality, whatever it is, is something different from law and custom. Cultural moral relativism holds that it is exactly societal custom, and is therefore a [[reductionism|reduction]] amounting to elimination.
* Morality, whatever it is, is something different from personal taste and preference. Subjectivism holds that it is exactly personal taste and preference, and is therefore a [[reductionism|reduction]] amounting to elimination.
The essence of the criticism is that moral relativism is "really" [[moral_nihilism|moral nihilism]] or an [[error_theory|error theory]].
As such, it may in fact be correct — the arguments do not tell us that it is not — but this criticism argues that it is being misrepresented as a positive theory. -->

<!-- === Normative moral relativism ===
One might argue that if one assumed the complete(but contradictory 'implied objective')truth of relativism, one would have no reason to prefer it over any other theory, given its fundamental contention that no preferred standard of truth exists. With this objective view of relativism it obviously becomes not simply a meta-ethical theory, but a [[normative_ethics|normative]] one, and its truth — by its own definition — remains (in the final objective analysis) outside assessment or beyond weighing against other theories. Relativism and objectivism thus can become the opposite sides of an argument about the existence (or not) of objective truth. Critics of this view assert that this argument places the [[burden_of_proof|burden of proof]] on relativism, by treating it as a theory that makes the positive existential claim "it is objectively true that there are no objective truths" (a claim no relativist would really make) as opposed to simply being the necessary consequence of a refusal to accept the objectivist's claim "there are objective truths". They argue that this objection can claim only to have defeated a rather singular version of relativism (singular in that it transparently appeals to an objective truth that it purports to deny). This however foregrounds the objectivist opinion on relativism without actually addressing what relativists believe. -->

== 宗教的批评 ==
道德相对主义不可避免地反对几乎世界所有[[宗教|宗教]]所教导的绝对道德。

=== 佛教 ===
<!-- [[Bhikkhu_Bodhi|Bhikkhu Bodhi]], an American [[Buddhist|Buddhist]] monk, wrote: 
:“By assigning value and spiritual ideals to private subjectivity, the materialistic world view, threatens to undermine any secure objective foundation for morality. The result is the widespread moral degeneration that we witness today. To counter this tendency, mere moral exhortation is insufficient. If morality is to function as an efficient guide to conduct, it cannot be propounded as a self-justifying scheme but must be embedded in a more comprehensive spiritual system which grounds morality in a transpersonal order. Religion must affirm, in the clearest terms, that morality and ethical values are not mere decorative frills of personal opinion, not subjective superstructure, but intrinsic laws of the cosmos built into the heart of reality.”<ref>[[Bhikkhu_Bodhi|Bhikkhu Bodhi]], "A Buddhist Response to Contemporary Dilemmas of Human Existence" [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/response.html article link at Access to Insight]</ref> -->
