==生平==
<!--
===球會===
;班列特
Freedman began his career with top flight [[Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 1992, but never made their first team. He moved to [[Football_League_Third_Division|Third Division]] [[Barnet_F.C.|Barnet]] on a free transfer in July 1994, aged 20. He made his league debut in August 1994 and quickly became the club's leading player as he struck 24 goals in his debut season. A bright start to the following season attracted the interest of [[Crystal_Palace_F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

;水晶宮
Freedman was signed by [[Crystal_Palace_F.C.|Crystal Palace]] for a fee of £800,000 in September 1995. He instantly showed he could continue his goalscoring form at the higher level when he netted 20 times in the [[1995-96_in_English_football|1995–96]] season. This haul included the second fastest hat-trick in Crystal Palace's history – 11 minutes – against [[Grimsby_Town_F.C.|Grimsby Town]] on 5 March 1996.

The following, 1996-97 season saw a less prolific 11 goals but helped the club to the promotion play-offs. He then scored crucial goals in the 89th and 90th minutes of their Play Off semi-final tie with [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.|Wolves]] after coming off the bench with 17 minutes left. Palace went on to win promotion in the [[Wembley_Stadium_(1923)|Wembley]] Play Off final, beating [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United]] 1–0.

Freedman's experience of [[Premier_League|Premier League]] football in the 1997-98 season proved short-lived though as he only managed seven top flight games before being sold to [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.|Wolves]], ironically the club he had helped deny promotion.

;狼隊
Freedman joined [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] initially on loan in October 1997, but after impressing with two goals in as many games, Wolves quickly signed him permanently in a £800,000 combined deal with Palace defender [[Jamie_Smith_(footballer_born_1974)|Jamie Smith]]. However, Freemans's time at Wolves only lasted until the end of the [[1997-98_in_English_football|1997–98]] season. He was the team's top goalscorer with 13 in total in a season that saw Wolves fail to mount a serious promotion challenge. The emergence of striker [[Robbie_Keane|Robbie Keane]] during the season helped convince [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.|Wolves]] to sell Freedman.

;諾定咸森林
In August 1998 Freedman signed for newly promoted Premier League side [[Nottingham_Forest_F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] for a fee of £950,000. He made his first appearance for Forest on 17 August 1998 as a substitute in a 2-1 defeat at Arsenal.  In his first full campaign in the top flight in 1998-99 he scored nine goals for Forest who were relegated that season to [[Football_League_First_Division|Division One]]. In his second season at Forest in 1999-2000 the club languished in mid-table under manager [[David_Platt_(footballer)|David Platt]]. Freedman made a total of 83 appearances, and scoring 23 goals, before being sold to [[Crystal_Palace_F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in October 2000.

;重返水晶宮
Freedman signed for Palace in October 2000 for a transfer fee of £600,000. He rejoined the club during a relegation threatened campaign, but one which ended with perhaps his most famous goal for the club. Relegation to the third tier loomed in their final game of the season at [[Stockport_County_F.C.|Stockport County]], with three minutes left and no score. Dramatically, Freedman then scored the vital goal that kept Palace in the division, and relegated [[Huddersfield_Town_A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]].

The following season saw Freeman bag 21 goals in all competitions, his best seasonal tally for Palace. This also earned him a call-up to the [[Scotland_national_football_team|Scottish national team]], to add to his earlier Under 21 caps. However, the next season was less of a personal success as he was dropped from the Scotland side, and began to find his appearances limited at Palace, as manager [[Trevor_Francis|Trevor Francis]] largely preferred [[Ade_Akinbiyi|Ade Akinbiyi]], [[Dele_Adebola|Dele Adebola]], and [[Andrew_Johnson_(English_footballer)|Andy Johnson]] to him.

His fortunes were revived in [[2003-04_in_English_football|2003–04]] though, as he re-established himself as a first choice regular under new manager [[Iain_Dowie|Iain Dowie]]. A strong surge in the second half of the season saw the club go from relegation contenders to the promotion play-offs. Freedman scored during the penalty shootout victory at [[Sunderland_A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the semi finals to help the club to the final. He was an unused substitute in the final though, which saw the club beat [[West_Ham_United_F.C.|West Ham]], the second time he had been promoted with the club.

However, life in the [[Premier_League|Premier League]] in [[2004-05_in_English_football|2004–05]] saw Freedman often overlooked as the team employed only one striker in most games, with [[Andrew_Johnson_(English_footballer)|Andy Johnson]] being the preferred choice in this role. Despite attracting interest from [[Leeds_United_A.F.C.|Leeds United]] midway through the season, he remained committed to the Palace cause of consolidating [[FA_Premier_League|Premier League]] status by rejecting a loan bid from the [[Football_League_Championship|Championship]] contenders. He stayed to score his only top flight goal for the club in their vital final fixture at [[Charlton_Athletic_F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], drawing them level at 1–1. However, the eventual 2–2 result saw the club endure a record third [[Premier_League|Premier League]] relegation.

Back in the [[Football_League_Championship|Championship]], he remained down the pecking order behind England international [[Andrew_Johnson_(English_footballer)|Andy Johnson]] and Republic of Ireland international [[Clinton_Morrison|Clinton Morrison]]. However, injuries to Johnson and [[Jon_Macken|Jon Macken]], and lack of form from Morrison brought him back into the team and he scored his 100th and 101st goals for Crystal Palace in a 3–2 win at rivals [[Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] on 20 November 2005. This made him only the seventh player in Palace history to have reached the century mark.

He managed to stay in the line-up after Johnson's return, having made a great impression on Palace boss [[Iain_Dowie|Iain Dowie]], who, later, made a public call to [[Scotland_national_football_team|Scotland]] boss [[Walter_Smith|Walter Smith]] for the striker to be given another chance in the national side. He ended the season with seven league goals, as the club comfortably reached the play-offs. However, they were beaten by [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] in their semi final tie to deny him a chance of a third promotion.

The appointment of [[Peter_Taylor_(footballer_born_1953)|Peter Taylor]] as manager in Summer 2006 limited Freedman's chances, and he could only manage three league goals. However, he extended his contract by a further two years at the conclusion of the season. Taylor was replaced by [[Neil_Warnock|Neil Warnock]] early in the [[2007-08_in_English_football|2007–08]] season, but strong goalscoring form of [[Clinton_Morrison|Clinton Morrison]] limited Freedman to rare substitute appearances.

;外借列斯聯
With Morrison keeping him out of the Palace side, Freedman, after initially rejecting the move (as he had done during the [[2004-05_in_English_football|2004–05]] season), decided to move to [[Football_League_One|League One]] club [[Leeds_United_A.F.C.|Leeds United]] on loan until the end of the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/7280856.stm |title=Freedman agrees terms with Leeds – BBC Sport |publisher=BBC Sport|date=6 March 2008|accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref>

He was in excellent form for [[Elland_Road|Elland Road]] club, scoring five goals to ensure a play-off place including a brace against [[Carlisle_United|Carlisle United]] in a 3–2 win at Elland Road, and also receiving praise from Leeds manager [[Gary_McAllister|Gary McAllister]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leeds_united/7345114.stm |title=Freedman earns McAllister tribute|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 April 2008 |accessdate=14 April 2009}}</ref> This form earned him League One's "''Player of the Month''" award for April,<ref>[http://www.leedsunited.com/page/NewsroomDetail/0,,10273~1306762,00.html Dougie's Award – leedsunited.com]</ref> while another vital late Play-off goal in the first leg of Leeds' semi-final tie with [[Carlisle_United_F.C.|Carlisle United]] and an assist for a last minute [[Jonathan_Howson|Jonny Howson]] goal in the second leg helped the Whites to [[Wembley_Stadium|Wembley]], where he featured in the Play-off final on the day of his 34th birthday, as Leeds were downed 1–0 by [[Doncaster_Rovers_F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]. After the season ended Freedman revealed that he wanted to join Leeds permanently, however Leeds signed [[Luciano_Becchio|Luciano Becchio]] and Freedman had to look elsewhere.<ref>http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/leedsunited/Leeds-United-v-Crystal-Palace.6648888.jp</ref>

Freedman is still held in very high regard by the Leeds United's supporters to this day despite such a short spell at the club, his impact in helping the team to the playoff final and his impressive interviews during his time at Leeds he will always be remembered as a cult hero.

;告別塞爾赫斯特
After returning to Palace at the end of the season, Freedman was granted a testimonial match to reward him for ten years' service at the club over two spells, with the match to be a first-team pre-season friendly fixture against [[Fulham_F.C.|Fulham]] at [[Selhurst_Park|Selhurst Park]] which ended in a 0–0 draw.

Following this match, Warnock allowed Freedman to depart Selhurst. He was heavily linked with a permanent move to Leeds, this never materialised.

;修安聯
Instead Freedman moved to [[Southend_United_F.C.|Southend United]] on a free transfer, scoring four goals in his first four outings for the Shrimpers. However his first season was plagued by injury. The following season saw the form of [[Lee_Barnard|Lee Barnard]] keep Freedman out of the side.
In March 2010 Freedman had his contract at Southend terminated by mutual consent to rejoin Palace as part of the coaching staff, signalling the end of his playing career.

===國家隊===
Freedman made his [[Scotland_national_football_team|Scotland]] debut on 6 October 2001, in a crunch match against [[Latvia_national_football_team|Latvia]] at [[Hampden_Park|Hampden Park]], for a place at the [[2002_FIFA_World_Cup|2002 FIFA World Cup]]. The Scots won the match 2–1, with Freedman scoring the equalising goal in the process (a header past then Palace teammate, goalkeeper [[Aleksandrs_Koliņko|Aleksandrs Koliņko]]), after [[Andrejs_Rubins|Andrejs Rubins]] (another Palace teammate at the time) had given the Latvians the lead. Despite this victory, Scotland failed to gain a place in the Finals, and manager [[Craig_Brown_(football)|Craig Brown]] resigned, being replaced by [[Berti_Vogts|Berti Vogts]].

He only got one more Scotland cap following Vogts' appointment, playing the first 45 minutes of Scotland's 5–0 defeat at the hands of [[France_national_football_team|France]] in a friendly.
