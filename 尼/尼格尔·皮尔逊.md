==生平==
===球員===
;梳士貝利
Pearson was born in [[Nottingham|Nottingham]] and began his playing career with non-league [[Heanor_Town_F.C.|Heanor Town]] before joining [[Football_League_Second_Division|Second Division]] [[Shrewsbury_Town_F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] in November 1981.<ref name="The ones that got away">{{cite news| last = Walker| first = Alex| title = The ones that got away| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/nottingham/content/articles/2005/02/10/sport_features_2005_02_footballers_that_got_away_feature.shtml| publisher = BBC Nottingham Sport| date= 10 February 2005| accessdate = 18 February 2008}}</ref> He made his first team debut in a 1–0 defeat at [[Oldham_Athletic_A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] on the opening day of the [[1982–83_in_English_football|1982–83 season]]. Pearson's first [[Football_League|Football League]] goal came on 12 March 1983 in a 3–1 win against [[Barnsley_F.C.|Barnsley]] at [[Gay_Meadow|Gay Meadow]]. Pearson ended the season with 39 out of a possible 42 starts as Shrewsbury finished in ninth place in [[1982-83_in_English_football#Second_Division_2|the table]].

The [[1983–84_in_English_football#Second_Division_2|following season]], Shrewsbury finished one place higher but injuries restricted Pearson to 26 games. Injury prevented him from playing at all in [[1984–85_in_English_football#Second_Division__2|1984–85]], when Shrewsbury again finished eighth in the table, but he returned in [[1985–86_in_English_football#Second_Division_2|1985–86]] making 35 appearances as Shrewsbury dropped to 17th.

In [[1986–87_in_English_football#Second_Division_2|1986–87]] he was an ever-present, making 42 appearances and contributing three goals, as the Shrews finished in 18th place. He started the next season, before being signed by [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]'s manager [[Howard_Wilkinson|Howard Wilkinson]] on 12 October 1987 for a fee of £250,000.

In his six years with Shrewsbury Town, he made a total of 184 appearances in all competitions, scoring five goals.

;錫周三
He moved to [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] in 1987.

He won the [[Football_League_Cup|League Cup]] as Sheffield Wednesday captain, during the [[1991_Football_League_Cup_Final|1990–91 season]], being selected as "Man of the Match" in the final at Wembley. In the same season, he also helped Sheffield Wednesday win promotion to Division One. During the 1992–93 season, he helped Sheffield Wednesday reach both domestic cup finals, but sadly broke his leg in the League Cup semi-final, and therefore could not play in either final. In all Pearson made more than 200 appearances for the Owls.

;米杜士堡
[[Middlesbrough_F.C.|Middlesbrough]] manager [[Bryan_Robson|Bryan Robson]] signed Pearson for £750,000 in 1994. Pearson captained them to promotion twice and to three domestic cup finals. Pearson retired from playing in 1998.<ref name="The ones that got away"/>

;初期
As manager of [[Carlisle_United_F.C.|Carlisle United]], Pearson helped to keep the club in [[the_Football_League|the Football League]] at the end of the [[1998–99_in_English_football#Division_Three|1998–99 season]]. He signed goalkeeper [[Jimmy_Glass|Jimmy Glass]] on loan, who scored an injury-time goal against [[Plymouth_Argyle_F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], saving the club from relegation to the [[Football_Conference|Football Conference]] at the expense of [[Scarborough_F.C.|Scarborough]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/6809 |title=Pearson still in shock at Newcastle |accessdate=24 May 2007 |date=12 May 2007 |work=Hickman, Niall |publisher=Daily Express}}</ref> The match was Pearson's last in charge of the [[Brunton_Park|Brunton Park]] outfit.

In 1999 he was recruited as [[Stoke_City_F.C.|Stoke City's]] first team coach by [[Gary_Megson|Gary Megson]]. Although Megson was sacked later that year by the club's Icelandic consortium, Pearson was kept on for a further two years under [[Gudjon_Thordarson|Gudjon Thordarson]], before being sacked in 2001.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Stoke sack Pearson| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/low/football/teams/s/stoke_city/1406969.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 25 June 2001 | accessdate = 12 January 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Pearson moved to [[West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] in November 2004 as assistant manager to [[Bryan_Robson|Bryan Robson]],<ref>{{cite news| title = Baggies appoint Robson as manager| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/3990013.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 9 November 2004| accessdate = 18 February 2008}}</ref> and took over as caretaker manager when Robson left the club in September 2006.<ref>{{cite news|date=18 September 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/5355924.stm|title=Robson and West Brom part company|publisher =BBC Sport|accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref> Albion won three and drew one of his matches in charge, before stepping down from the role in preparation for the arrival of new manager [[Tony_Mowbray|Tony Mowbray]].<ref>{{cite news|date = 17 October 2006 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/6058698.stm|title= Pearson stands down at West Brom |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=27 May 2007}}</ref>

On 19 October 2006, he was linked with the [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] manager's position but instead took over as assistant manager of Newcastle United, replacing [[Kevin_Bond_(footballer)|Kevin Bond]], who was dismissed following a bung scandal. Pearson's influence was most apparent in Newcastle's defence, which looked a lot more composed after Pearson became assistant manager.

On 1 February 2007, Pearson was confirmed as assistant coach to [[Stuart_Pearce|Stuart Pearce]], the [[England_national_under-21_football_team|England U21]] team manager, until after the [[UEFA_U-21_Championship_2007|2007 European Championships]]. As Pearce's contract limited him to involvement in only one friendly before the Championship, Pearson led the under-21s in their 3–3 draw against Italy on 24 March 2007, the first game at the new [[Wembley_Stadium|Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6481857.stm |title=Pearson relishing Wembley honour  |accessdate=23 March 2007 |date=23 March 2007|work=Fletcher, Paul |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.thefa.com/England/mens-under-21s/News/2007/EngU21_Pearson |title=Pearson: It's a 'real honour' |accessdate=12 April 2011 |date=24 March 2007 |work= |publisher=Football Association}}</ref>

When Newcastle manager [[Glenn_Roeder|Glenn Roeder]] resigned on 6 May 2007, Nigel Pearson took charge of the remaining game of the season, away to [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]]. Pearson stayed on at Newcastle as a coach following the arrival of [[Sam_Allardyce|Sam Allardyce]] as manager at the club.<ref name="Coach Round set for Magpies role">{{cite news| title = Coach Round set for Magpies role| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/6253452.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 29 June 2007 | accessdate = 29 July 2007}}</ref> On 9 January, following the departure of manager [[Sam_Allardyce|Sam Allardyce]], he was re-appointed as caretaker manager for Newcastle's trip to [[Manchester_United_F.C.|Manchester United]].<ref>{{Cite news | title = Allardyce reign ends at Newcastle| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/7179847.stm| publisher = BBC Sport| date = 9 January 2008 | accessdate = 13 January 2008}}</ref> Newcastle lost 6–0, thanks to a [[Cristiano_Ronaldo|Cristiano Ronaldo]] hat trick, a brace from [[Carlos_Tévez|Carlos Tévez]] and a rare [[Rio_Ferdinand|Rio Ferdinand]] goal. On 16 January 2008, after [[Kevin_Keegan|Kevin Keegan]] had been announced as the next permanent manager of the club, Pearson took charge of the team for the 3rd round FA Cup replay against [[Stoke_City_F.C.|Stoke City]], which Newcastle won 4–1. On 8 February, though, it was announced that Pearson had left the club.<ref>{{cite news| title = Pearson leaves Newcastle| url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11678_3122513,00.html| publisher = Sky Sports| date = 9 February 2008 | accessdate = 9 February 2008}}</ref>

;修咸頓
On 18 February 2008, Pearson was appointed as manager of [[Southampton_F.C.|Southampton]] on a rolling contract.<ref>{{cite news| title = New manager named| url = http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/news/?page_id=9759| publisher = Southampton FC| date = 18 February 2008 | accessdate = 18 February 2008}}</ref> His career at Southampton got off to a poor start, losing 2–0 to [[Plymouth_Argyle_F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]] on the day he took charge; he thus had no involvement in selecting the team. He saw his first point and goal away at [[Scunthorpe_United_F.C.|Scunthorpe United]].

On 4 May 2008, with only one game to go at home to [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United]], the Saints were facing relegation to [[Football_League_One|League 1]]. After going 1–0 down, Pearson's side pulled-off an impressive comeback to win the game 3–2, and secure Championship status for another season, at the expense of [[Leicester_City_F.C.|Leicester City]], who could only manage a 0–0 draw with [[Stoke_City_F.C.|Stoke City]]. On 30 May 2008, Pearson was replaced by Dutch coach [[Jan_Poortvliet|Jan Poortvliet]] after only three months in charge.<ref>{{cite news| title = Southampton replace Pearson with Poortvliet| url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/may/30/southampton?gusrc=rss&feed=football| publisher = Guardian newspaper| date = 30 May 2008 | accessdate = 1 July 2008 | location=London | first=John | last=Ashdown}}</ref>

On 20 June 2008, Pearson was appointed as manager of [[Leicester_City_F.C.|Leicester City]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pearson appointed Leicester boss |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/7465094.stm |publisher=BBC Sport

He was also named the League 1 manager of the month in December 2008. On 18 April 2009, Leicester won 2–0 at [[Southend_United|Southend United]], confirming their promotion back to the [[Championship|Championship]] as League One champions, in a season which saw them break several club records including the longest unbeaten run in the league for a 23 match stretch without defeat between 1 November 2008 and 7 March 2009.

Leicester continued their upsurge in form under Pearson, finishing an impressive 5th place in their first season back in the Championship, booking themselves a place in the Championship play-offs. However, they were defeated by [[Cardiff_City_F.C.|Cardiff City]] by virtue of a [[Penalty_shootout_(association_football)|penalty shoot-out]] in the play-off semi final, despite fighting back from a 2 goal deficit in the second leg.

At the end of the season, Pearson took a hard line on controversial Leicester defender [[Wayne_Brown_(defender)|Wayne Brown]], who had publicly admitted in front of his team mates - including some of ethnic minority backgrounds - that he had voted for the far right [[British_National_Party|British National Party]] in the [[United_Kingdom_general_election,_2010|general election on 6 May]]. He dropped Brown from the side for the playoffs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1278734/Revealed-What-BNP-supporter-Wayne-Brown-said-enrage-Leicester-team-mates.html|title=Revealed: What BNP supporter Wayne Brown said to enrage his Leicester team-mates|last=Hunter|first=Derek|date=16 May 2010|work=Mail Online|accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref> During the close season, Brown left the club to sign for [[Preston_North_End|Preston North End]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/preston/8794442.stm|title=Preston North End sign Craig Morgan and Wayne Brown|date=6 July 2010|work=BBC Sport|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 April 2011}}</ref>

On 29 June 2010, he was appointed [[Hull_City_A.F.C.|Hull City]] manager.<ref>{{cite web|title= Hull City name Nigel Pearson as new manager|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/8758153.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 June 2010|date=29 June 2010}}</ref> 
Despite severe financial difficulties following relegation from the Premier League, Pearson was still able to make some movement in the transfer market, bringing in players such [[Nolberto_Solano|Nolberto Solano]], [[Liam_Rosenior|Liam Rosenior]], [[Robert_Koren|Robert Koren]] and [[Jay_Simpson|Jay Simpson]]. Despite winning the opening game against the future play-off winners [[Swansea_City_A.F.C.|Swansea City]], Hull City under Pearson endured a slow start to the campaign. Things began to turn for the better when the club won their first away game in over a year at [[Norwich_City|Norwich City]] in September. Following that victory, Pearson led the club to breaking a 66-year-old record of consecutive away games without defeat.<ref>{{cite web|title= Coventry 0-1 Hull: Daily Mirror match report|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/news/Coventry-0-1-Hull-Daily-Mirror-match-report-Aaron-McLean-s-goal-breaks-Tigers-away-game-record-article713419.html|publisher=Daily Mirror|accessdate=26 September 2011|date=13 March 2010}}</ref>.
