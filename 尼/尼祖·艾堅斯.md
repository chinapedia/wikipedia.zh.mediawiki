==生平==
===球員===
As a player, Adkins was [[Goalkeeper_(association_football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Tranmere_Rovers_F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], [[Wigan_Athletic_F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Bangor_City_F.C.|Bangor City]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article6999163.ece Nigel Adkins plays mind games as Scunthorpe steel themselves for second crack at City this season] – Times Online</ref> He graduated from the [[University_of_Salford|University of Salford]] in Physiotherapy.<ref>[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=99038&sectioncode=26 "Having a Ball"], [[Times_Higher_Education|Times Higher Education]], 24 November 1995</ref>

;賓高城
Adkins was in charge of [[Bangor_City_F.C.|Bangor City]] in the [[League_of_Wales|League of Wales]], where he was at the helm for the Citizens' title wins in 1994 and 1995.

;斯肯索普
Adkins was appointed [[caretaker_manager|caretaker manager]] by [[Scunthorpe_United_F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] chairman Steve Wharton in November 2006, following the departure of the previous manager, [[Brian_Laws|Brian Laws]]. Adkins had previously held the role of physio at the club.<ref>[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/jan/26/nigel-adkins-scunthorpe-united Nigel Adkins works wonders as Scunny make the most of little money] – The Sport Blog; [[The_Guardian|The Guardian]] newspaper</ref> After his spell as caretaker he was appointed as permanent manager on 7 December 2006.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/scunthorpe_utd/6216840.stm Scunthorpe appoint Adkins as boss] – BBC Sport </ref>

As Adkins had been promoted to the manager's seat from the role of club physiotherapist, Scunthorpe supporters [[Football_chant|chanted]] "Who needs [[Jose_Mourinho|Mourinho]], we've got our physio!" on the terraces of [[Glanford_Park|Glanford Park]] in his honour.<ref>[http://soccerlens.com/nigel-adkins-profile/6223/ Nigel Adkins – Adkins diet just the tonic for united Scunny] – SoccerLens</ref>

Adkins guided Scunthorpe to promotion from [[League_One|League One]] to the [[Coca-Cola_Championship|Championship]] with three matches to spare on 14 April 2007, and they went on to seal the divisional title to end an absence of more than 40 years from the league's second tier.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/s/scunthorpe_utd/6557311.stm Adkins hails Sharp as Iron go up] – BBC Sport </ref> ''[[The_Sun_(newspaper)|The Sun]]'' newspaper named Adkins the "emergency boss of the year" in an article that looked at the match winning average of replacement bosses in the 2006–07 season following the departure of the previous manager.<ref>[http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/football/20395/Who-needs-Mourinho.html Who Needs Mourinho?] – The Sun </ref>

Scunthorpe were relegated from the Championship the following season, but returned via the League One playoffs in May 2009, playing at Wembley in consecutive months, having played [[Luton_Town_F.C.|Luton Town]] in the final of the [[2008–09_Football_League_Trophy|Football League Trophy]] on 5 April.

They struggled once again in the higher division, but this time avoided relegation by finishing 20th and being five points clear of Sheffield Wednesday – the last relegated club.

Adkins joined [[Southampton_F.C.|Southampton]] on 12 September 2010 after the Saints and [[Scunthorpe_United_F.C.|Scunthorpe United]] agreed a compensation package. Adkins has signed a three year contract, and is joined there by his former assistant at Scunthorpe, [[Andy_Crosby|Andy Crosby]].<ref>{{cite web|title=New First Team Manager Appointed |url=http://www.saintsfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10280~2152032,00.html|publisher=Southampton FC|accessdate=13 September 2010|date=12 September 2010}}</ref> Nigel gained his first victory in charge in his third game winning 1–0 at [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], with [[Lee_Barnard|Lee Barnard]] scoring the only goal. The good start to his tenure continued and he guided Southampton into the play-off part of the table for the first time in League One on 2 November 2010 after a 4–0 win over [[Dagenham_&_Redbridge_F.C.|Dagenham & Redbridge]]. After this result, the club joined the League One promotion rush, which was expected of them at the start of the campaign, and before the slow start. On the clubs 125th anniversary match, Adkins saw his side beat Peterborough 4–1. This was the sixth home win in a row, the best home form for the football club since 1992. Adkins guided his team into the top two for the first time since being relegated, after a 4–0 win over [[Exeter_City_F.C.|Exeter City]] on New Year's Day 2011 and managed a victory against Premier League opposition in [[Blackpool_F.C.|Blackpool]] just one week later, taking his side into the 4th round of the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]]. Just three days later it got even better for Nigel as he led his side to a 6-0 win away to [[Oldham_Athletic_F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] and in the process recorded their fifth straight victory. During Adkins' first transfer window at the club, he secured the contract of highly rated winger [[Adam_Lallana|Adam Lallana]] for a new 4 and a half year contract. He signed winger [[Dany_N'Guessan|Dany N'Guessan]] on loan from [[Leicester_City|Leicester City]], and signed [[Jonathan_Forte|Jonathan Forte]] on a 3 and a half year contract from Adkins' former club [[Scunthorpe_United_F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. 

Under the guidance of Adkins, The Saints achieved a club record of clean sheets in one season. Beating the previous record of 19 set by [[Peter_Shilton|Peter Shilton]] in the early 80s. Adkins guided his side to promotion into the [[Football_League_Championship|The Championship]] after a 3–1 home win against [[Walsall_F.C.|Walsall]] on 7 May 2011, earning his third [[Football_League_One|Football League One]] promotion in his managerial career. He also got acknowledged by the footballing authorities as he won the [[Football_League_One_Manager_of_the_Month|League One Manager of the Month]] for April 2011 after winning seven of the eight games that month and putting Southampton on the brink of promotion.

He then broke a 12 year hoodoo of not winning on the opening day of the league season by beating [[Leeds_United_F.C.|Leeds United]] at St. Mary's by three goals to one and send them straight into second in the [[Football_League_Championship|The Championship]]. In the process, he also broke a record by leading Southampton to seven consecutive league wins for the first time in their history.

Two subsequent away wins, against Barnsley (1-0) and Ipswich (5-2) kept Southampton top of the [[Football_League_Championship|The Championship]]. The club record of consecutive league victories extended to 10 after a 1-0 win at home to [[Millwall_F.C.|Millwall]]. They suffered a minor blip in their next game, a 3-2 defeat at [[Leicester_City_F.C.|Leicester City]] but bounced back winning 3-1 in the second round of the Carling Cup at [[Swindon_Town_F.C.|Swindon Town]]. Nigel then guided The Saints to two successive home wins in a week; 3-2 over [[Nottingham_Forest_F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and 4-1 against [[Birmingham_City_F.C.|Birmingham City]]. This meant Nigel achieving another record at Southampton of winning 13 consecutive home league games.
