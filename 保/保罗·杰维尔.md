<!--
==生平==
===球員===
Born in [[Liverpool|Liverpool]] and educated at [[De_La_Salle_School_(Liverpool)|De La Salle School]], Jewell began his career as an apprentice with home-city club [[Liverpool_F.C.|Liverpool]], but because of the dominance of [[Ian_Rush|Ian Rush]] and [[Kenny_Dalglish|Kenny Dalglish]] he never made a first-team league appearance and pursued his career elsewhere.

In December 1984, Jewell moved to [[Wigan_Athletic_F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] for £15,000.  He made his league debut for Wigan against [[Rotherham_United_F.C.|Rotherham]] in a 3–3 draw. He played a total of 137 league appearances with Wigan, scoring 35 goals before moving to [[Bradford_City_A.F.C.|Bradford City]] in an £80,000 deal.<ref name="markham">{{cite book

He spent a decade as a player at City scoring 56 league goals in 269 appearances, and forged a successful partnership with [[Sean_McCarthy_(football)|Sean McCarthy]] for four of those seasons—the most of successful of which was in [[1992-93_in_English_football|1992–93]] when Jewell scored 16 league goals and McCarthy 17 in the first season of new player-manager [[Frank_Stapleton|Frank Stapleton]].

Jewell had a brief loan spell at [[Grimsby_Town_F.C.|Grimsby Town]], before returning to Bradford eventually retiring as a player in [[1997-98_in_English_football|1997–98]]—although his last game came in the promotion-winning season from [[Football_League_Second_Division|Division Two]] in [[1995-96_in_English_football|1995–96]] under manager [[Chris_Kamara|Chris Kamara]].

===領隊===
;巴拉福特
Jewell had already started his coaching career long before he hung up his boots and had become part of City's coaching staff during the successful 1995–96 campaign.<ref name="markham"/> The following season City came 21st in [[Football_League_First_Division|Division One]] avoiding relegation with a 3–0 victory on the final day of the season against [[Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]]. The following season started much better and with 13 points from a possible 15, City were top after five games, but results declined and chairman [[Geoffrey_Richmond|Geoffrey Richmond]] sacked Kamara on 6 January 1998 three days after a 2–0 [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] defeat to [[Manchester_City_F.C.|Manchester City]].

Richmond turned to Jewell, who was by now Kamara's assistant, and he won his first game 2–1 to [[Stockport_County_F.C.|Stockport County]]. In his 21 games in charge, Jewell won six games and drew five to guide City to 13th, their highest position since Jewell had joined the club. He was rewarded with a permanent contract when others expected Richmond to turn to a big name.<ref name="markham"/> Richmond wanted to make a promotion challenge and Jewell broke the club's transfer record twice within the first week of the [[1998-99_in_English_football|1998–99]] season, first with the £1m acquisition of [[Lee_Mills|Lee Mills]] and then spending £1.3m on [[Arsenal_F.C.|Arsenal]] youngster [[Isaiah_Rankin|Isaiah Rankin]] as well as bringing back [[Stuart_McCall|Stuart McCall]] to the club from [[Rangers_F.C.|Rangers]]. After a poor start to the season, when City won just one of its first seven games, City picked up momentum and were second behind [[Sunderland_A.F.C.|Sunderland]] for most of the latter half of the season. He added [[Lee_Sharpe|Lee Sharpe]] on loan and the third £1m signing [[Dean_Windass|Dean Windass]] as City held off [[Ipswich_Town_F.C.|Ipswich Town]] and [[Birmingham_City_F.C.|Birmingham City]] to Division One runners-up and promotion to the [[Premier_League|Premier League]] marking Bradford's return to top flight football for the first time in 77 years.

Bradford found Premiership life tough in [[1999-2000_in_English_football|1999–2000]] but their survival was secured on the last day of the season when they beat Liverpool 1–0 against expectation at home and cost their opponents a [[UEFA_Champions_League|UEFA Champions League]] place, while the last [[promotion_and_relegation|relegation]] place went to [[Wimbledon_F.C.|Wimbledon]].  Jewell handed in his notice just a few days later after meeting with the Richmond, who had deemed City's 17th placed Premiership finish "a disappointment".  Richmond refused to accept Jewell's resignation from the club, as he contended that Jewell had already lined up a job at [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] whilst still contracted to City and placed Jewell on [[Garden_leave|gardening leave]].  After agreeing to a compensation package with City, Jewell was installed as manager at relegated Wednesday.<ref name="leavingbcfc">{{cite book | author=David Markham | coauthors=Lindsay Sutton | title=The Bradford City Story: The Pain & the Glory | publisher = [[Breedon_Books|Breedon Books]] | date=3 February 2006 | isbn=1-85983-499-X}}</ref>

Jewell had been hoping to mount a [[promotion_and_relegation|promotion]] challenge in [[2000-01_in_English_football|2000–01]] with Wednesday but after enduring a torrid eight months in charge was sacked in February 2001 with the debt-ridden [[Hillsborough_Stadium|Hillsborough]] club struggling near the foot of Division One. His highlight was the 2–1 [[League_Cup|League Cup]] victory over local rivals [[Sheffield_United|Sheffield United]] and victory over [[Premier_League|Premier League]] [[West_Ham_United|West Ham United]].

;韋根
In June 2001, Jewell made his return to management with ambitious Division Two club [[Wigan_Athletic_F.C.|Wigan Athletic]].  In his second season as manager ([[2002-03_in_English_football|2002–03]]) the club won the [[Football_League_Second_Division|Division Two]] championship and entered the upper half of the English professional football league system for the first time ever.  They were near the top of Division One throughout the [[2003-04_in_English_football|2003–04]] season but were pipped to a [[playoff|playoff]] place on the final day of the season by [[Crystal_Palace_F.C.|Crystal Palace]]—who went on to win the playoffs.

On the final day of the [[2004-05_in_English_football|2004–05]] [[Football_League_Championship|Championship]] season, Jewell's Athletic side clinched promotion to the Premiership bringing top flight football to the [[Lancashire|Lancashire]] town for the first time.  For the [[FA_Premier_League_2005-06|2005–06]] season, Jewell's side lost their first game at home to [[Chelsea_F.C.|Chelsea]] via a last-minute winner from [[Hernán_Crespo|Hernán Crespo]] but won their first match two games later at home to [[Sunderland_A.F.C.|Sunderland]].  They contested the [[Football_League_Cup|League Cup]] final against [[Manchester_United_F.C.|Manchester United]] on 26 February 2006 but went down 4–0. Jewell's name was linked to the England manager's job when it was announced that [[Sven-Göran_Eriksson|Sven-Göran Eriksson]] would quit after the [[2006_FIFA_World_Cup|2006 FIFA World Cup]], but the job went to [[Steve_McClaren|Steve McClaren]] instead.

On the final day of the [[2006-07_in_English_football|2006–07]] season, Jewell steered Wigan safe from relegation after a win against [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United]] at [[Bramall_Lane|Bramall Lane]] on 13 May 2007. A day later, Jewell resigned as Wigan manager.<ref name="Jewell resigns as Wigan manager">One reason for Jewell's resignation from Wigan was because he was under a lot of stress.{{cite news

On 11 February 2007 during the aftermath of Wigan's defeat at the hands of [[Arsenal_F.C.|Arsenal]], Jewell accused referee [[Phil_Dowd|Phil Dowd]] of failing to award Wigan a penalty and for allowing what appeared to be an offside goal. After the game Jewell was charged by the [[The_Football_Association|FA]] for improper conduct regarding his verbally insulting the referee. For this offence Jewell was fined [[£|£]]2000 and given a two match touchline ban (suspended for 12months). A second charge relating to the same referee was brought by the [[Football_Association|Football Association]], and was heard on 16 May 2007 and was found not proven.<ref name="Jewell hits out at referee Dowd">{{cite news
