'''保王人民黨'''（[[泰語|泰語]]：'''''พรรคประชาราช'''''，[[拉丁字母|拉丁字母]]：'''''Phracharaj'''''）是泰國當今的政黨，她由前[[泰愛泰黨|泰愛泰黨]]的主席[[沙農|沙農]]（''Sanoh Thienthong''）創辦於[[2006年1月|2006年1月]]。<!-- is a Thai political party. The party was established and registered with the Electoral Commission on 10 January 2006 by , former Thai Rak Thai party chairman. The meaning of the party name is 'Loyal to the royal'. -->

該黨成立之後，沙農曾經多方邀請能人加入，比如前副總理[[浦拉猜|浦拉猜]]（''Purachai Piemsomboon''）、前總監察長[[恰如盼·邁達嘉|恰如盼尊女士]]（''Khunying Jaruwan Mentaka''）等人，但都未能如願。2007年該黨一度打算與[[中立民主黨|中立民主黨]]合併拼[[2007年泰國議會選舉|大選]]，但後來又因為兩黨領導人政見不一而作罷。<!-- Sanoh approached many well known individuals, such as former Deputy Prime Minister Purachai Piemsomboon, Head of the Office of the Attorney General Khunying Jaruwan Mentaka and Secretary General of the Chaipattana Foundation Sumet Tuntivejakul, to be the leader of the party, but all declined. Thus, Sanoh, himself, became the leader with Prachai Liewpairat elected as Secretary-General and Pramuan Rujanaseri as Deputy Leader -->
