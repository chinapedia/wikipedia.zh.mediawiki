<!--
== 出生 ==
Ive was born in Chingford, London, United Kingdom. His father was a silversmith who lectured at Middlesex Polytechnic. "He's a fantastic craftsman, his Christmas gift to me would be one day of his time in his college workshop, during the Christmas break when no one else was there, helping me make whatever I dreamed up". Ive attended the Chingford Foundation School, then Walton High School in Stafford. During his high school years, Ive was passionate about cars and it was this interest that led to his later career as a designer. Following graduation from Walton, Ive explored the option of studying car design in London, such as the course offered at the Royal College of Art; however, he encountered a learning environment that was off-putting: "The classes were full of students making vroom! vroom! noises as they drew".

Ive studied industrial design at Newcastle Polytechnic, which is now Northumbria University. Items from his student portfolio, such as a hearing aid design, were exhibited at the Design Museum in London. Ive had been interested in drawing and making anything he could think of. Since he was a teenager, he was unsure of what area to specialise in after leaving Newcastle. After meeting with various design experts, he was drawn to product design. He was given employment at London design agency Roberts Weaver group, his college sponsor. Ive graduated with a first class Bachelor of Arts degree in 1989.

Ive explained that his discovery of the Apple Mac, after "having a real problem with computers" during his later student years, was a turning point. Fearing he was "technically inept", he felt the Apple user experience was a departure from the computer design at that time[3] and was particularly impressed by the intuitive mouse-driven system.[4]

== 童年 ==
After a year with Roberts Weaver, Ive joined a London startup design agency called Tangerine,[1] located in Hoxton Square where he designed a diverse array of products, such as microwave ovens and toothbrushes.[4] However, his frustration with the position reached a turning point after he designed a toilet, bidet and sink for client Ideal Standard, and the company's boss rejected Ive's work, stating that the products were too costly and looked too modern.[4][5] Ive was unhappy working for clients whom he disliked and who didn't possess the same principles. Apple was a Tangerine client that Ive appreciated and he had been acting in a consultancy role for the computer firm while at Tangerine, creating the initial PowerBook designs. Apple had actually been attempting to recruit him as a full-time employee for two years without success.[4]

Ive worked as a consultant for Apple's Chief of Industrial Design at the time Robert Brunner, and eventually became a full-time Apple employee in 1992.[4][6] He designed the second generation of the Newton, the MessagePad 110, taking him to Taipei for the first time. Shortly before Jobs's return to Apple, Ive nearly resigned from the company. Jon Rubinstein, Ive's boss at the time, managed to retain Ive as an employee by explaining that Apple was "going to make history" following the revival of the company.[5]

He became the Senior Vice President of Industrial Design in 1997 after the return of Jobs, and subsequently headed the industrial design team responsible for most of the company's significant hardware products.[7] Ive's first design assignment was the iMac; it helped pave the way for many other designs such as the iPod and eventually the iPhone and the iPad.[8] Jobs made design a chief focus of the firm's product strategy, and Ive proceeded to establish the firm’s leading position with a series of functionally clean, aesthetically pleasing, and remarkably popular products. Ive explained the close rapport that existed in his working relationship with Jobs in 2014: "When we were looking at objects, what our eyes physically saw and what we came to perceive were exactly the same. And we would ask the same questions, have the same curiosity about things." Ive described Jobs as "so clever", with "bold" and "magnificent" ideas.[4]

The work and principles of Dieter Rams, the chief designer at Braun from 1961 until 1995, influenced Ive's work. In Gary Hustwit's documentary film Objectified (2009), Rams says that Apple is one of only a handful of companies existing today that design products according to Rams' ten principles of "good design."[9][10]

Ive runs his own laboratory at Apple, in which he oversees the work of his appointed design team, and he is the only Apple designer with a private office.[11] Only his core team — which consists of around 15 people from Britain, America, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand (who have worked together for around two decades) — and top Apple executives are allowed into the laboratory, as it contains all of the concepts, including prototypes, that the design team is working on.[4] Ive also refuses to allow his children to enter the laboratory.[5] According to the Jobs biography, Ive's design studio contains foam-cutting and printing machines, while the windows are tinted. Jobs told biographer Walter Isaacson: "He has more operational power than anyone else at Apple except me."[12]

On 29 October 2012, Apple announced that "Jony Ive will provide leadership and direction for Human Interface (HI) across the company in addition to his role as the leader of Industrial Design."[13] With the WWDC13 announcement of the iOS7 and Ive's role as principal, the Apple Press information was also updated to reflect his new title: Senior Vice President of Design.

The scheduled publication of an unofficial Ive biography was announced in late 2013. Written by Leander Kahney, who conducted interviews with former Apple designers and executives, the book is titled Jony Ive: The Genius Behind Apple's Greatest Products.[5]

In March 2014, Time magazine published a feature interview with Ive, in which he revealed an optimistic view of his future with Apple:


We are at the beginning of a remarkable time, when a remarkable number of products will be developed. When you think about technology and what it has enabled us to do so far, and what it will enable us to do in future, we’re not even close to any kind of limit. It’s still so, so new ... At Apple, there’s almost a joy in looking at your ignorance and realizing, ‘Wow, we’re going to learn about this and, by the time we’re done, we’re going to really understand and do something great.’ Apple is imperfect, like every large collection of people. But we have a rare quality. There is this almost pre-verbal, instinctive understanding about what we do, why we do it. We share the same values.

In the same interview, Ive stated that he hopes that his best work is yet to emerge and that he prefers to be identified as a maker of products, rather than a designer. Ive believes that there is "a resurgence of the idea of craft" in 2014.[4]

==生平==
伊夫曾就讀於-{zh-tw:清福德;zh-cn:青福德}-基礎學校（Chingford Foundation School）和華頓高中（Walton High School）。接著他在纽卡斯尔理工学院（Newcastle Polytechnic， 今[[諾森布里亞大學|諾森布里亞大學]]（Northumbria University）研讀工業設計。在就讀華頓高中時，他就已經從父親身上學到了許多技術和繪畫技巧。伊夫在中學時代就認識了他的妻子海瑟·佩格（Heather Pegg）。他們在1987年結婚，育有一對雙胞胎兒子，現居於美國加州[[舊金山|舊金山]]。

伊夫曾說他在14歲時就知道自己對「畫出和製作東西」有興趣。設計這件事一直存在於他的心中，但他不確定未來將會設計什麼。他的興趣非常廣泛，從傢俱和珠寶到船隻與汽車。他過去從來不確定自己的興趣會對人生有什麼影響。直到他遇見了許多專業設計師，他才確定自己想要繼續研讀工業設計。<ref name="dailymail">{{cite news|last=Waugh|first=Rob|title=How did a British polytechnic graduate become the design genius behind £200billion Apple?|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1367481/Apples-Jonathan-Ive-How-did-British-polytechnic-graduate-design-genius.html#ixzz1dAFpzwIQ|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=2012年7月10日|location=倫敦|date=2011年3月|archive-date=2017年11月4日|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171104011759/http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1367481/Apples-Jonathan-Ive-How-did-British-polytechnic-graduate-design-genius.html#ixzz1dAFpzwIQ|dead-url=no}}</ref>

伊夫曾表示在大學時開始認識[[麥金塔電腦|麥金塔電腦]]是他的轉捩點之一。具體來說，最重要的是他從蘋果使用者經驗中獲取的正面感受，他認為這是與當時電腦設計缺少創意截然不同的體驗。<ref name="DM">{{cite web|title=Jonathan Ive|url=http://designmuseum.org/design/jonathan-ive|publisher=[[設計博物館|設計博物館]]|accessdate=2012年7月10日|archive-date=2014年8月26日|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160738/http://designmuseum.org/design/jonathan-ive|dead-url=no}}</ref>
乔纳森总是很少在媒体面前亮相，甚至几乎没有接受采访。

== 事業 ==
畢業之后，他建立了他个人的橘子设计工作室。[[苹果电脑|苹果电脑]]是他的客户之一，他让苹果产生的深刻印象使他在1992年获得在[[库比提诺|库比提诺]]总部工作的机会，以扭转苹果日渐衰弱的设计部门。

但在[[史蒂夫·乔布斯|史蒂夫·乔布斯]]（Steve Jobs）回归蘋果公司之前，艾维可说是英雄无用武之地，甚至好几次萌生退意，直到1997年，蘋果收購[[NeXT|NeXT]]，乔布斯回到蘋果接任執行長后，大刀阔斧地进行改革，艾维才得以受以重任。

2015年7月，乔纳森·艾维正式被任命爲“首席設計長”（Chief Design Officer）<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html |title=蘋果高管資料頁面 |accessdate=2015-08-29 |archive-date=2015-08-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150820163140/http://www.apple.com/pr/bios/jonathan-ive.html |dead-url=no }}</ref>。

2019年6月，乔纳森宣布在年内离开苹果，创办自己的设计公司LoveFrom，并继续为客户苹果公司提供设计服务。<ref name='LeaveApple' /><ref name='LeaveAppleBBC' />苹果股价因此下跌1%。<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-06-27/how-much-was-jony-ive-worth-to-apple-market-says-9-billion |title=存档副本 |access-date=2019-06-30 |archive-date=2019-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190904165315/https://www.bloomberg.com/amp/news/articles/2019-06-27/how-much-was-jony-ive-worth-to-apple-market-says-9-billion }}</ref> 同年11月底，他的[[名稱|名稱]]不再在蘋果[[網站|網站]]（Apple Leadership）看得到。<ref>Thomas Ricker, [https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20986838/jony-ive-last-day-apple Jony Ive has left Apple] {{Wayback|url=https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/28/20986838/jony-ive-last-day-apple |date=20191129034432 }}.

=== 作品 ===
在加入蘋果電腦之後，乔纳森·艾维參與了該公司大多數產品的設計，其代表作包括令蘋果電腦起死回生的[[iMac|iMac]]系列，全球銷量達六千八百萬部的數碼音樂播放器[[iPod|iPod]]系列與2007年6月11日於美國開售的[[iPhone|iPhone]]，与他设计的其它产品[[Power_Mac_G4_Cube|Power Mac G4 Cube]]和[[Power_Mac_G5|Power Mac G5]]同样知名。

在[[史考特·福斯托|史考特·福斯托]]（Scott Forstall）離開蘋果後，乔纳森接手iOS的界面設計。2013年的[[蘋果公司全球軟體開發者年會|蘋果公司全球軟體開發者年會]]首次推出了其負責的新iOS版本——[[iOS_7|iOS 7]]。

== 工作嗜好 ==
艾维以无私著名，在一次访问中，他总指出让他获得名望的产品中多少是由团队合作完成的。他在业余时间會编写[[流行電音|电子流行乐曲]]（techno-pop）。

== 座右铭 ==
艾维常说：<blockquote>“大多数的时候，设计是以最直覺的方式把产品的特色传递到人们的脑中。”</blockquote>在介绍iOS7的视频中，他说：<blockquote>真正的简约不只是删繁就简，而是在纷繁中建立秩序。</blockquote>

== 评价 ==
[[财富_(杂志)|《财富》]]杂志把乔纳森·伊夫评选为世界上最聪明的设计师：“每个漫步在纽约市[[现代艺术博物馆|现代艺术博物馆]]或巴黎[[龐畢度中心|蓬皮杜国家艺术中心]]的人，都会看到他早期的代表产品。但与大多数博物馆里的创新家不同，伊夫能够将他的智慧融入设计中，并为大众所喜爱——包括他那要求严苛的老板。他的确非常聪明。”最重要的一点还在于：“乔纳森‧伊夫不仅为苹果公司，而且给更广阔的设计界设定了方向。”

長期為德國家電製造商[[德国博朗|百靈]]（Braun）及英國家具公司[[Vitsœ|Vitsœ]]操刀產品設計的德國工業設計師[[迪特·拉姆斯|迪特·拉姆斯]]（{{lang|de|Dieter Rams}}），在工業設計紀錄片《Objectified》中曾表示蘋果是唯一一家遵循他「好的設計」（{{lang|de|gutes Design}}）原則去設計產品的公司。乔纳森·伊夫主導設計的產品大多帶有迪特·拉姆斯風格及理念<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future |title=The Future Of Apple Is In 1960s Braun: 1960s Braun Products Hold the Secrets to Apple's Future |publisher=Gizmodo.com |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2010-06-30 |archive-date=2010-06-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623002235/http://gizmodo.com/343641/1960s-braun-products-hold-the-secrets-to-apples-future |dead-url=no }}</ref>。
