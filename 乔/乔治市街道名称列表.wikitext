本列表阐述并介绍[[马来西亚|马来西亚]][[槟城州|槟城州]][[首府|首府]][[乔治市|乔治市]]范围内的街道名称。1780年代，槟城在[[海峡殖民地|海峡殖民地]]政府的接管统治下成为[[大不列颠王国|大不列颠王国]]最早的[[远东|远东]]贸易[[转口港|转口港]]，乔治市正值开辟期间皆由[[殖民|殖民政府]]为新建街道命名。槟城摆脱英国殖民统治后，乔治市街道在马来西亚[[1963/67年国语法令|1963/67年国语法令]]下为迎合国家政策需要而被译成[[马来语|马来语]]，但大量街道的英语原名仍沿用迄今。

乔治市街道名称多与当时老百姓的生活起居和习惯、环境、人物、历史事迹等息息相关，反映了城市的[[多元文化|多元文化]]遗产。乔治市的街牌除马来文之外，一般附有[[英文|英文]]、[[中文|中文]]或[[阿拉伯文|阿拉伯文]]译名。

== 街道名称变化 ==
部分的街道官方名称在[[马来亚|马来亚]]独立后有少许改动，但纵观而言，乔治市的街道大多保留了殖民时期所沿用的名称，尽管这些街道只用作标识路牌上马来文名称的翻译。直至2007年，由于国家强制执行国语法令，乔治市的路牌仅被允许使用马来文列明。问题是，此决定令许多游客感到困惑，他们发现难以将槟城人通用的英文名字与路牌上的马来文名字相提并论，而两者的名字往往截然不同。在专有名词的情况下，英文名字较易于辨识，例如[[华盖街|华盖街]]的英文原名为''Farquhar Street''，则译成''Lebuh Farquhar''。不过就那些不谙马来文的人来说，有些直译的名称由于字眼有异而显得格外陌生，譬如土库街英文原称''Beach Street''被直译为''Lebuh Pantai''。另外有部分街道反而有了全新的马来文名字，如青草巷英文全名''Green Lane''被改为''Jalan Masjid Negeri''（中文名为州清真寺路）。

然而，乔治市的中文路名与众多官方名称是不相应对的，同一条路的不同段落亦有不一样的名字，其街道皆为民间华人以方言（如[[闽南话|闽南话]]、[[广东话|广东话]]、[[潮州话|潮州话]]等）口耳相传而命名，反映了百年来该街的商业活动或民俗风情等。虽然中文路名并没有摘入官方档案，但当地的华人百姓却广泛应用，渐渐凝结成一个个固定的路名符号。

== 路牌设计 ==

[[File:China_St_Ghaut,_George_Town,_Penang.jpg|缩略图]]
乔治市市中心最早的路牌设计是长方形的蓝底白字铁板，它们通常被贴在店屋底楼的顶端。In the suburbs, rectangular cast-iron signs with indented corners (white with black lettering and edging) in English and sometimes Jawi script, fixed at head-height to a black iron pole surmounted with a finial, could also be seen. Almost all of these have been replaced by the modern road signs.

By 2007, rectangular reflective road signs (green with white lettering) in the Malay Rumi script had largely replaced the older signs. These were initially at waist-height, fixed to two black metal supports, and subsequently at head-height, fixed to a single black metal support. These signs also indicated the postal town and postcode.

Since 2007, new bilingual reflective street signs based on the old suburban signs have started to replace the Malay-only street signs. These are partly based on the old white signs, and are rectangular with indented corners (green with white lettering) and mounted at head-height to a black iron pole surmounted with an onion dome. The street name is given in Malay and English, together with the town and postcode.

In June 2007, while Penang was under the rule of Gerakan, street signs in Chinese were illegally set up by Penang's Democratic Action Party (DAP) Socialist Youth division along several roads in George Town under the justification it helps attract tourists from China, only to be removed by the Penang Municipal Council.

On July 22, 2008, following DAP's electoral victory in Penang and George Town's entry into UNESCO's World Heritage Site list, Gerakan was reported to have placed Chinese-language on existing street signs at six roads, claiming the signs were now vital with George Town's recognition by UNESCO and serve as a reminder to DAP of its earlier promises to erect such signs if voted into office. DAP Socialist Youth National Organizing secretary Koay Teng Hai had also proposed to include Tamil and Jawi translations, depending on the cultural background of the area, along with Chinese street names.

政府将乔治市街道的英文名译为马来文名称，皆有一套命名系统以免引起混淆，但亦有例外。相对之下，中文名称的翻译较为复杂，基本上其街道名称一般依据以下条件:
#街名由来为'''华裔先贤姓名'''，获保留；
#街名由来为其他语言，则用'''[[音译|音译]]或[[意译|意译]]'''；
#街名为'''民间沿用已久的中文名称'''，获保留，[[生造字|生造字]]或[[方言|方言]]除外；
#街名采用'''通用字'''而不取[[生僻字|生僻字]]、[[多音字|多音字]]或[[方言字|方言字]]。

*'''Jalan'''译为路而不是'''惹兰'''或方言'''律'''；'''Lorong'''译为巷而不是'''羅弄'''或'''冷'''（英文Lane）
*'''Street(Lebuh)'''译为'''街'''，'''Road(Jalan)'''译为'''路'''，'''Lebuhraya(Expressway)'''译为'''大道'''，有时会有所差异；

*'''Lintang'''的译名为'''岭当'''
*'''Pengkalan'''译为'''彭加兰或码头'''
*'''Halaman'''译为'''哈拉曼'''

*'''Lengkok'''译为'''冷格'''
*'''Persiaran'''译为'''道'''
