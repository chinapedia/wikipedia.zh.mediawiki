<!--==劇情==
Marceline arrives at the Candy Kingdom and beseeches Bubblegum to help her track down Maja, the Sky Witch (voiced by [[Jill_Talley|Jill Talley]]), arguing that it will allow the two to spend "[[quality_time|quality time]]" with one another. Bubblegum eventually agrees, and the two journey to Maja's trap-infested lair. Bubblegum soon learns that Marceline is hoping to retrieve her beloved teddy bear, Hambo, that her ex-boyfriend Ash had previously traded for a magic wand. Bubblegum is annoyed that Marceline is worrying about a mere teddy bear, but Marceline, thinking that she sees Hambo, takes off, deeper into the lair.

Bubblegum gives chase, eventually discovering the inner sanctum of Maja's lair, where she confronts Maja herself. With Marceline disposed, fighting Maja's crow-rabbit [[familiar|familiar]], Bubblegum realizes that since Maja purchased Hambo legally however dubious the transaction was, she has to respect the sale. She therefore trades Maja her beloved rock shirt for Hambo. Maja is later seen ominously musing that, because the shirt has more "psychic resonance", she will be able to use it for "something big."

"Sky Witch" was written and storyboarded by Ako Castuere and [[Jesse_Moynihan|Jesse Moynihan]], from a story by [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], Jack Pendarvis, Moynihan, and [[Adam_Muto|Adam Muto]]. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Nate Cash.<ref name=episodecitation>{{cite episode| title=Sky Witch| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Nate Cash & Nick Jennings (directors); Ako Castuera & Nate Cash (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=July 29, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 29}}</ref> On the behest of Pendarvis, Moynihan and Castuera inserted a reference to the 1973 film ''[[Don't_Look_Now|Don't Look Now]]'', although Pendarivs later noted that because the two storyboard artists "worked a magical transformation", it was "not really an allusion anymore".<ref>{{cite web|last=Pendarvis|first=Jack|title=Do Look Now|url=http://jackpendarvis.blogspot.com/2013/07/do-look-now.html|publisher=[[Blogger_(service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=2014-05-03|date=2013-07-30}}</ref> The design for Marceline's outfit was based on an [[American_Apparel|American Apparel]] model that Moynihan and Castuer had both seen. In turn, they decided to "make fun of" it and exaggerate it for use in the show.<ref name=jessewb>{{cite web|last=Moynhihan|first=Jesse|title=Sky Witch|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013142608/http://jessemoynihan.com/?p=2042|publisher=JesseMoynihan.com|accessdate=2014-04-28|date=2013-07-26}}</ref>

He was largely tasked with drawing finalized versions of Maja—heavily based upon Moynihan and Castuera's designs—as well as certain key frames for the episode.<ref>{{cite web|last=Houghton|first=Chris|title=The Sky Witch!|url=http://chrishoughtonart.tumblr.com/post/56881601442/the-sky-witch-here-are-a-couple-of-drawings-i-did|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=2014-04-28|date=2013-07-30}}</ref> Santino Lascano, one of the background artists for the show, declared that the episode was "fun" to design for because it allowed him to draw new locations. He noted that Maja's totems featured in the episode were designed to resembled the real-life sculptures made by Castuera.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lascano|first=Santino|title=Sky Witch|url=http://santinolascano.tumblr.com/post/57206935473/earlier-this-week-sky-witch-premiered-on|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=2014-04-28|date=2013-08-02}}</ref>

Sonia Saraiya of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode an "A" and called it "awesome in every way" due to it showcasing Marceline and Princess Bubblegum's developing friendship. Saraiya applauded the fact that the show pushed two characters who are "both terrible at demonstrating their own vulnerability" together, allowing both of the character's faults to play off of one another.<ref>{{cite web|last=Saraiva|first=Sonia|title=Adventure Time: 'Sky Witch'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-sky-witch-100764|work=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

Some critics argued that the episode seemed to officially recognize a relationship between Marceline and Bubblegum, unofficially referred to as "Bubbline", a portmanteau of "Bubblegum" and "Marceline". Dana Piccoli of [[AfterEllen.com_and_TheBacklot.com|AfterEllen.com]] wrote that the episode "appears to shift Bubbeline from subtext to [[Canon_(fiction)|canon]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Piccoli|first=Dana|title=Are 'Adventure Time'{{'}}s Princess Bubblegum and Marceline the Real Deal?|url=http://www.afterellen.com/are-adventure-times-princess-bubblegum-and-marceline-the-real-deal/08/2013/|publisher=[[AfterEllen.com_and_TheBacklot.com|AfterEllen.com]]|accessdate=2014-05-03|date=2013-08-05}}</ref> "Ali Osworth of ''[[Autostraddle|Autostraddle]]'' argued that the episode was evidence that the show was moving towards officially recognizing, or "canonizing", the relationship.<ref>{{cite web|last=Osworth|first=Ali|title=This Is A Bubbline Appreciation Post and Gallery|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/this-is-a-bubbline-appreciation-post-and-gallery-191755/|publisher=[[Autostraddle|Autostraddle]]|accessdate=2014-05-03|date=2013-08-24}}</ref> On his website, Moynihan, however, argued that the meaning of the episode is up in the air and is contingent on how the audience interprets it. He noted: "I think it’s important for me express that I rarely believe a writer has more authority over the meaning of their writing than the audience. When you submit a narrative to the public [the] writer no longer has the last word and sometimes their word is worse anyway."<ref name=jessewb/>
