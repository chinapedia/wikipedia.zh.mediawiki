<!--==劇情==
Following from the events of "[[Sky_Witch|Sky Witch]]", Maja (voiced by [[Jill_Talley|Jill Talley]]) summons an elemental being composed of plant material named Darren (voiced by [[Alan_Oppenheimer|Alan Oppenheimer]]) and allies herself with him; the two plan on destroying the Candy Kingdom. Once the duo attack, Princess Bubblegum is able to keep the giant at bay with a force field, but Root Beer Guy sacrifices his life to get it up and running. Finn and Jake abruptly leave the scene, forcing Colonel Candy Corn (voiced by [[Keith_Ferguson_(voice_actor)|Keith Ferguson]]) and Princess Bubblegum to hold Darren and Maja at bay.

Eventually, Finn and Jake return with the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant (voiced by [[Steve_Agee|Steve Agee]]), and the war elephant and Darren engage in combat. Finn is able to dive into Darrens' brain and kill him, causing Maja to hit her head on a tree and fall into a coma. After Finn frees the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant from servitude, he wanders all of Ooo, questioning his purpose. Eventually, he decides to nurse Maja back to health, but serve as a protector and moral guide for the rogue witch.

The origins of "Something Big" date back to a scrapped ''Adventure Time'' television movie that was going to air in the middle of the [[Adventure_Time_(season_5)|fifth season]]. The first ten minutes of the movie's storyboard were drafted by Moynihan, who was particularly proud of his work. However, trouble soon began to set in, and the crew decided to scrap the project; Moynihan, reluctant to see his work abandoned, suggested that the series cannibalize parts of the movie's storyboard to make individual episodes. Once this was agreed upon, Moynihan took his opening section and used approximately half as the genesis for "Something Big".<ref name=howtheepisodehappened>{{cite web|last1=''Adventure Time'' production staff|first1=|title=Something Big|url=http://kingofooo.tumblr.com/post/90413746144/something-big-promo-by-writer-storyboard|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|work=KingOfOoo|accessdate=July 1, 2014|date=June 30, 2014}}</ref> The death of Root Beer Guy was inserted into the episode by Moynihan on behest of Pendarvis, who voiced the character in the [[Root_Beer_Guy|eponymous season five episode]]; Pendarvis reasoned that, because Root Beer Guy had been promoted to head of the banana guards, but had failed to improve them, his death would rationalize why the guard was still so incompetent.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pendarvis|first1=Jack|title=Big Baby|url=http://jackpendarvis.blogspot.com/2014/07/big-baby.html|publisher=[[Blogger_(service)|Blogger]]|accessdate=July 4, 2014|date=July 4, 2014}}</ref>

Darren Franich of ''[[Entertainment_Weekly|Entertainment Weekly]]'' awarded the episode a "B+", calling it "unhinged".<ref name=ew/> Despite calling it "a bit unwieldy", he felt that it was also "one of the most full-crazy, trippiest episodes the show's ever done."<ref name=ew/> He also selected a quote from Darren—about a dream he had in which soldiers were capable of birthing more warriors from their own blood—as an example of the madcap and absurd nature of the episode.<ref name=ew>{{cite journal|last1=Franich|first1=Darren|title=Thursday July 3|journal=[[Entertainment_Weekly|Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 4, 2014|url=https://31.media.tumblr.com/75d23a8fb5b6e292bb527e652f3ec61b/tumblr_n7v0qfac1o1rn2uy4o1_500.jpg|accessdate=July 1, 2014|publisher=[[Time_Inc.|Time, Inc]]}}</ref> A later online review of the episode, courtesy of ''Entertainment Weekly'', argued that "Something Big" was evidence that "''Adventure Time'' might be the greatest show on television right now."<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Trahan|first1=Ryley|title='Adventure Time' recap: An Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant Never Forgets|url=http://community.ew.com/2014/07/05/adventure-time-recap-season-6-episode-10/|accessdate=October 3, 2014|journal=[[Entertainment_Weekly|Entertainment Weekly]]|date=July 5, 2014}}</ref>

Oliver Sava of the ''[[A.V._Club|A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode an "A", calling it "awesome in the classical sense: 'inspiring an overwhelming feeling of reverence, admiration, or fear.'"<ref name=avclubelephant/> He praised the first half of the episode—dealing largely with the battle between the citizens of the Candy Kingdom and Darren—calling it "fun" and "so massive in terms of the visuals and the situations".<ref name=avclubelephant/> He also applauded the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant's personality crisis, noting that it made a convincing argument for existentialism. Sava also compared the episode to Moynihan's graphic novel series, ''Forming'', both in style and content.<ref name=avclubelephant>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Review: ''Adventure Time'': "Something Big"|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-something-big-206555|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
