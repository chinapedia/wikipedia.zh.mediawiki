'''Research Unix'''，是一系列的[[Unix|Unix]][[作業系統|作業系統]]的通稱，由[[貝爾實驗室|貝爾實驗室]]的計算機科學研究中心（{{lang|en|Computing Science Research Center}}，部門編號1127）研發，因此得名，共有10個版本。這些Unix系統運行在[[DEC|DEC]] [[PDP-7|PDP-7]]，[[PDP-11|PDP-11]]，[[VAX|VAX]]，以及Interdata 7/32與8/32電腦上。

Merged most of the utilities of [[PWB/UNIX|PWB/UNIX]] with an extensively modified kernel with almost 80% more lines of code than V6. In February, a port called [[UNIX/32V|32V]] was made to DEC's [[VAX|VAX]] hardware; 32V was the basis for [[Berkeley_Software_Distribution|4BSD]].

| 9th Edition
| Sep. 1986
| Incorporated code from 4.3BSD; used internally. Featured a generalized version of the [[STREAMS|Streams]] [[Interprocess_communication|IPC]] mechanism introduced in V8. The mount system call was extended to connect a stream to a file, the other end of which could be connected to a (user-level) program. This mechanism was used to implement network connection code in userspace.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=David L. Presotto |author2=Dennis M.
