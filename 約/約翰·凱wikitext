Although Ainsworth knew the son as an old man, and could not have met the inventor himself, Lord (1903) wrote that this ''"settles the question of doubt as regards the portraits which [[#Thomas_Sutcliffe|Lieut.-Col.

Lord acknowledges that no Paris death registration exists for John Kay between 1750 and 1770, but says that this is because ''"documents of all kinds were destroyed during the [[Paris_Commune|Commune]] revolutionary days"'' —see Lord (1903) p. 169.

'''約翰·凱'''（John Kay，{{bd|1704年|6月17日|1780年|}}），著名[[英國|英國]][[發明家|發明家]]，其發明的[[滑輪梭子|滑輪梭子]]（俗稱[[飛梭|飛梭]]）對[[工業革命|工業革命]]有重大的影響、對紡織業有歷史性的重大貢獻。

== 生平 ==
約翰·凱在1704年出生於[[英國|英國]][[蘭開夏郡|蘭開夏郡]]的[[伯里|伯里]]市，父親是一個[[自耕農|自耕農]]民。關於他早期生活的資料不多。

在他發明飛梭前，英國人一直使用[[手搖紡織機|手搖紡織機]]來織布，這機器需要織工用兩手使梭子來回穿梭以織成一幅窄幅布，效率不高，織較寬闊的[[布匹|布匹]]時更需要二人同時操作。這機器被沿用多個[[世紀|世紀]]，直至1733年約翰·凱為飛梭申請專利，才慢慢的取代了手搖紡織機。

飛梭能自動穿梭往復，令[[緯紗|緯紗]]快速穿越[[經紗|經紗]]，因而只需一個[[織工|織工]]就能快速地織出寬闊的布，大大減少了人力需求。但他並沒有因此名成利就，一些工廠使用飛梭織布但拒絕給予他[[專利權|專利權]]稅，就此他花了很多時間和精神以追討賠償。此外，由於飛梭使工廠大大減少了勞動需求，一些[[織布廠|織布廠]]織工認為他的發明令他們的生計受到威脅，所以在1753年，暴民洗劫了他在伯雷的房子。約翰·凱為此感到心灰，並遷往[[法國|法國]]重新開始他的生活和工作，並在當地售賣飛梭，但成績不理想。

他被後人稱為在[[紡織工業|紡織工業]]史上最重要的人物之一，但他在死前仍未得到英國人的認同，並於1780年在[[貧困|貧困]]中死去。
