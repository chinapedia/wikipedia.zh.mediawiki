This list is populated by writing entering a value in the [linglist] field but not in the [iso3] field of [[Template:Infobox_language|Template:Infobox language]]. As ISO codes are assigned to these languages, the articles should be updated to remove them from this category. In the case of dialects of languages with assigned ISO codes, however, the ISO code is not used in the info box for the dialect, because it is not specific to the dialect.

[The following articles might benefit from adding |isoexception=dialect to their infobox to move them to the dialect subcategory. The obvious ones have already been moved; most of the remaining 76 have not been reviewed:
