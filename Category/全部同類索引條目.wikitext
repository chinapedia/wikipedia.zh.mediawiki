{{Wikipedia category|hidden=yes}}

This is a tracking category for [[Wikipedia:同類索引條目|同類索引條目]].

Pages are put in this category by templates such as {{tl|SIA}}, {{tl|mountainindex}} and {{tl|shipindex}}. That is, templates built with the {{tl|dmbox}} meta-template, which is doing the actual categorising. 

Note that currently {{tl|given name}} and {{tl|surname}} also put pages in this category, and such pages perhaps are not really set index articles. (See the [[Template_talk:Dmbox#Category:All_disambiguation_pages|discussion about that]].)

See also [[:Category:全部消歧義頁面|:Category:全部消歧義頁面]] and [[:Category:全部主條目消歧義頁面|:Category:全部主條目消歧義頁面]] for the corresponding lists for disambiguation pages.
