For consistency, the name of this and similar categories use country names rather than adjectivals, as some country adjectivals are less than straightforward (see [[Template:Adjectivals_and_demonyms_for_countries_and_nations|Template:Adjectivals and demonyms for countries and nations]] in the [[List_of_adjectival_forms_of_place_names|List of adjectival forms of place names]])
