This category is added to an article page if the {{para|Ship image}} field of {{tlx|infobox ship begin}} is omitted or left blank (see the infobox [[Template:Infobox_ship_begin/Usage_guide#Infobox_Ship_Image|Usage guide]]). The category is automatically removed once an image is added.

If you have a suitable photograph (subject to copyright compliance) or can make one, it would be appreciated. 

If you are prepared to release one of your own photographs as public domain or licensed under GFDL or Creative Commons, then please upload it to the [[:commons:Main_Page|Wikimedia Commons]] so Wikipedias in other languages can use it.
