{{Cleanup category}}
{{wikipedia category|hidden=yes}}

This category is triggered if certain unsupported fields are used in the language infobox. Currently, the detectable fields are: 
 caption, map_caption, rank, country, regions, status, SIL, sil, silname, child1, child2, children, iso5, year

Of these, only 'caption' and 'year' are common errors. Others are occasionally found when an {{tl|infobox language family}} box is imperfectly converted to language use, or are remnants of old fields which may be occasionally resurrected from someone's archives. 'Regions' is not a problem, but could be integrated into 'region' if it becomes one.
