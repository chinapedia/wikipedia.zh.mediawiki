{{Maintenance category|tracking=true|empty=true|polluted=true}}

This category is used to track {{tlx|Lang}} and {{tld|Lang-??}} templates where the three-character language code ([[ISO_639-2|ISO 639-2]], -2T, [[ISO_639-3|-3]]) has been promoted to the equivalent two-character code ([[ISO_639-1|ISO 639-1]]). This category is used only by [[Module:Lang|Module:Lang]]. Articles listed here are sorted by the three-character language code.

Where these promotions occur, a hidden message is also available. Editors who wish to see the messages, you may do so by updating their [[Special:MyPage/common.css|common]] or [[Special:MyPage/skin.css|skin]] CSS stylesheet to include:
:{{code|.lang-comment {display: inline !important;} /* show lang messages */||lang=css}}
