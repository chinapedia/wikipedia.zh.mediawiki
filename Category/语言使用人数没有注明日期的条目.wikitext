These articles have info boxes in which there is an estimate of the number of speakers, but no date has been entered into the <code>date</code> field. That field tracks the age of the data and flags it when it is more than a certain number of years old. (Currently set to 30.)  Articles do not appear here when the field is purposely set to <code>no date</code>, meaning that the reference itself (typically ''Ethnologue'') lacks a date for the data.

Articles with ISO3 codes have been reviewed with ''Ethnologue'' 17.  Some remaining dialects may be datable with the parent ISO code.
