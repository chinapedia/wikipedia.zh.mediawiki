{{polluted category}}
{{wikipedia category|hidden=yes}}
This category is triggered by language infoboxes which do not contain any language codes, such as [[ISO_639-3|ISO 639-3]], LingList, Guthrie, etc. (ISO 639-2 does not count, as it is not language-specific in such cases.)

Ideally, this category should be empty, apart from unclassified varieties such as [[Danzhou_dialect|Danzhou dialect]], which (as of 2012) are not clearly a dialect of an ISO language, but not clearly a distinct language either. 

For languages which are simply not covered by ISO, enter <code>iso3=none</code>, and the article will appear in a dedicated category. 

For dialects of languages which are covered by ISO, add the parameter <code>isoexception=dialect</code>. This is how dialects should normally be treated, as ISO codes are not generally dialect-specific and therefore should not be used in such cases; <code>iso3=none</code> is similarly inappropriate for dialects subsumed under the ISO code of their parent language. ''Linguist List, Linguasphere,'' Guthrie and AIATSIS may, however, provide dedicated codes that are appropriate for dialect articles; if one of these is added, the article will appear in a separate category.

If <code>isoexception</code> is set to <code>talkpage</code>, the article won't be listed in any category at all. This is used so that archived talk pages with discussions of the info box won't pollute the category.
