These redirects are pointed to by links that should always point to the disambiguation page (via these redirects) rather than be disambiguated.  As such, membership should generally be restricted to only those redirects that have "(disambiguation)" in their title. Contrast to [[:Category:Redirects_from_ambiguous_pages|:Category:Redirects from ambiguous pages]].

When using such redirects, "What links here" on a [[Wikipedia:Disambiguation_pages_with_links|disambiguation page with links]] sorts such links separately (e.g. see [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Georgian|Special:Whatlinkshere/Georgian]]).
