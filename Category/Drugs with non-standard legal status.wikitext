* Listed under " ": Schedule/classification input {{!xt|1=<nowiki>{{Unicode|℞}}</nowiki>}} should be replaced by {{xt|1=℞}} or {{xt|1=Rx}}.

* Listed under '''<nowiki>*</nowiki>''': {{para|legal status}} has "{{Unicode|Rx}} only". However, this is impossible as a general statement, there is no such worldwide status. The input should be more precise (for example: "Usually prescription only in Asia").

* For all countries and institutes listed here: {{para||legal_XX}} should have a valid code from the listed options only. All descriptive text should be added in {{para|legal_XX_comment}}. If this causes a problem, please report at [[Template_talk:Infobox_drug|this]] talkpage.
