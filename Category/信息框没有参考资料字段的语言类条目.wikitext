These articles have info boxes with speaker information but without anything in the <code>ref</code> field.  This category is not triggered where "speakers" is set to "?" or "none" (triggering "unknown" or "''None''"), by "extinct" or "era" instead of "speakers".  {{tl|cn}} or &nbsp; may also be added to the ref field.
