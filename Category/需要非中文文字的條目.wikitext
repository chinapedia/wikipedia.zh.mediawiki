This is a category of articles that need the original script versions of their names added to the lead paragraphs, or in an appropriate template. 

To add an article to this list, add {{tl|original script}} to the top of the article's talk page.

If the original script can be identified and is one of the subcategories, a more specific template should be used, please follow the link below for more specific instructions.

If you add the original script to an article in this category, simply remove the {{tl|original script}} from the talk page, and it will no longer show up in this list. Many of the articles in this category also need to be cleaned up, wikified, or expanded. Feel free to help these articles out while you add the original script to them, if you like.
