{{commonscat|Abstraction}}
'''Abstraction''' is the [[thinking|thought process]] in which [[idea|idea]]s are distanced from [[object|object]]s.
''Abstraction'' uses a strategy of ''simplification of detail'', wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus speaking of ''things in the abstract'' demands that the ''listener'' have an intuitive or common experience with the ''speaker'', if the speaker expects to be understood.
