==Is the article actually worthy of inclusion?==
Before placing templates on a page it is worthwhile to cast a [[Critical_thinking|critical]] eye over the page to determine whether it should in fact be included in Wikipedia. Some articles can be tagged for [[WP:SPEEDY|speedy deletion]] or marked as an [[WP:AFD|article for deletion]].
