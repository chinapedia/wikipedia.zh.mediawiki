This category contains '''Wikipedia essays''' — [[Wikipedia:Project_namespace|project pages]] on Wikipedia-related topics, but with no official status.  Pages tagged with {{tlx|essay}} categorize here if they are in the Wikipedia namespace and into [[:Category:User_essays|:Category:User essays]] if they are in userspace.  Please use more specific templates where appropriate:

* {{tlx|Behavioral essay}}
* {{tlx|Civility essay}}
* {{tlx|Deletion essay}}
* {{tlx|Guidance essay}}
* {{tlx|Humorous essay}}
* {{tlx|Information page}}
* {{tlx|Notability essay}}
** {{tlx|WikiProject notability advice}}

Essays in the Wikipedia namespace may be edited by anyone.  Essays in the ''User'' namespace are normally edited only by the user that hosts the page and are categorized with [[:Category:User_essays|:Category:User essays]], usually via {{tl|user essay}}.  User essays may be moved categorically into the ''Wikipedia'' namespace and this category if they are frequently referenced, as evidenced by becoming an evolving expression of multiple editors.  Wikipedia essays may be moved into userspace (or deleted) if they are found to be unhelpful or to contradict a settled point of policy.

Additional essays may be found in the [[Wikimedia_Foundation|WMF]]-wide [[meta:Category:Essays|meta:Category:Essays]]. For non-Wikipedia-related essays, as article topics, see [[:Category:Essays|:Category:Essays]].
