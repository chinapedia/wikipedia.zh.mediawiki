These language articles have infoboxes with spurious families at the top of the tree, generally because the fam1 parameter is omitted and the family is auto-filled from familycolor 'American', 'Australian', 'Papuan', 'Khoisan', 'Caucasian', 'Andamanese', or 'Paleosiberian'. ('Altaic' does not trigger this template, though it does fill in the family cell of the infobox with a request that a specific family be entered.) Manually entered spurious families will not be included here unless identical to one of the above; for others, see [[:Category:没有语系配色的语言|:Category:没有语系配色的语言]].
