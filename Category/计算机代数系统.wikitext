A '''[[計算機代數系統|計算機代數系統]] (CAS)''' or '''symbolic computation system''' is a system of software packages that facilitates [[symbolic_mathematics|symbolic mathematics]]. Typically, these systems include
* arbitrary precision ([[高精度计算|高精度计算]]) arithmetic, allowing for instance to evaluate [[圓周率|圓周率]] to 10,000 digits.
* symbolic manipulation engine, to simplify algebraic expressions, [[导数|导数]] and [[积分|积分]] [[函数|函数]]s and solve equations
* graphing facility, to produce graphs of functions, typically in two and three dimensions
* [[线性代数|线性代数]] subsystem, to allow [[矩阵|矩阵]] computations and solving of systems of linear equations
* high level [[编程语言|编程语言]], allowing users to implement their own algorithms
More advanced examples usually include more sophisticated tools, including [[Gröbner_basis|Gröbner basis]] packages for manipulating [[理想_(环论)|理想 (环论)]]s in [[多项式环|多项式环]]s, which is essential for many advanced real-world applications involving [[微分方程|微分方程]]s, [[机器人学|机器人学]], and so forth, as well as packages for working at a high level with [[向量|向量]]s and [[張量|張量]]s.
