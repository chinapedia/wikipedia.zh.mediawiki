'''虛構語言'''（{{lang|en|Fictional languages}}）為一部分虛構設定的[[人工語言|人工語言]]，例如在書籍或電影裡所虛構設定的語言。虛構語言的本意是為一個虛構世界而設定的語言，且通常為與它們相關聯的虛構世界予以更多的深度和合理性的表現來設計，並虛構出「外人」（{{lang|en|alien}}）和「非外人」（{{lang|en|dislocated}}）不同角色之間以虛構語言來進行溝通。 

其中的一些語言，比如，出現在[[奇幻小说|奇幻小说]]、{{link-en|另類的宇宙 (同人小說)|Alternative universe (fan fiction)|另類的宇宙小說}}、地球未來之小說，或[[架空歷史小說|架空歷史小說]]等之虛構語言，被作為現代英語或其他自然語言的扭曲版本或方言，有的小說則是自己設計[[人工語言|人工語言]]。
<!--
==目的==
Fictional languages are separated from artistic languages by both purpose and relative completion: a fictional language often has the least amount of grammar and vocabulary possible, and rarely extends beyond the absolutely necessary. At the same time, some others have developed languages in detail for their own sake, such as [[J._R._R._Tolkien|J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Quenya|Quenya]] and [[Sindarin|Sindarin]] and [[Star_Trek|Star Trek]]'s [[Klingon_language|Klingon language]] which exist as functioning, usable languages. Here "fictional" can be a [[misnomer|misnomer]].

By analogy with the word "conlang", the term ''[[conworld|conworld]]'' is used to describe these fictional worlds, inhabited by fictional [[constructed_culture|constructed culture]]s. The conworld influences vocabulary (what words the language will have for flora and fauna, articles of clothing, objects of technology, religious concepts, names of places and tribes, etc.), as well as influencing other factors such as pronouns, or how their cultures view the break-off points between colors or the gender and age of family members.

==專業虛構的語言==
'''Professional fictional languages''' are those languages created for use in books, movies, television shows, video games, comics, toys, and musical albums (prominent examples of works featuring fictional languages include the Middle-earth and Star Trek universes and the game [[Myst|Myst]]).

{{main|Alien language}}
A notable subgenre of fictional languages are [[alien_language|alien language]]s, the ones that are used or might be used by putative [[extraterrestrial_life|extraterrestrial life]] forms. Alien languages are subject of both [[science_fiction|science fiction]] and scientific research.

Perhaps the most fully developed fictional alien language is the Klingon language of the Star Trek universe - a fully developed [[constructed_language|constructed language]].

The problem of alien language has confronted generations of [[science_fiction|science fiction]] writers; some have created fictional languages for their characters to use, while others have circumvented the problem through translation devices or other fantastic technology.

Although this field remains largely confined to science fiction, the possibility of intelligent extraterrestrial life makes the question of alien language a credible topic for [[science|scientific]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] speculation.

While many cases an alien language is but an element of fictional reality, in a number of science fiction works the core of the plot are linguistic and psychological problems of communication between various alien races.

==基於互聯網的虛構語言==
'''Internet-based fictional languages''' are hosted along with their "conworlds" on the Internet, and based at these sites, becoming known to the world through the visitors to these sites; [[Verdurian|Verdurian]], the language of [[Mark_Rosenfelder|Mark Rosenfelder]]'s Verduria on the planet of Almea, is a flagship Internet-based fictional language. Many other fictional languages and their associated conworlds are created privately by their inventor, known only to the inventor and perhaps a few friends. In this context the term "professional" (used for the first category) as opposed to "amateur" (used for the second and third) refers only to the professionalism of the used medium, and not to the professionalism of the language itself or its creator. In fact, most professional languages are the work of non-linguists, while many amateur languages were in fact created by linguists, and in general the latter are better developed. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}
