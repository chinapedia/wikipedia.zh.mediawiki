'''住棚节四样植物''' （{{lang-he|'''ארבעת המינים'''}}，''Arba'at Ha-Minim''或''Arba Minim''）是[[犹太人|犹太人]]在庆祝[[住棚节|住棚节]]时，按照律法书的规定，必须握在手中摇动的三种枝条和一种果实，代表特别的意义。这四样植物是：[[枣椰树|枣椰树]]（[[希伯来语|希伯来语]]：לולב，lulav，类似棕树）叶子、 [[香桃木属|香桃木]]（希伯来语：הדס，hadass）枝条、[[柳树|柳树]]（希伯来语： ערבה ，aravah）枝条和[[香橼|香橼]]（希伯来语：אתרוג，etrog，类似[[柠檬|柠檬]]）果实。<!-- 前三种枝叶通常捆扎在一起。在节日之前，犹太教团体中通常都会出售这些植物。不过，在一些[[犹太教改革派|犹太教改革派]]团体中，对于其中一种或几种非本地出产的植物，采用芦苇等其他植物来代替。 -->

<!-- ==Practice==
The [[mitzvah|mitzvah]] of waving the Four Species derives from the [[Torah|Torah]]. In [[Leviticus|Leviticus]], it states: “''And you shall take for yourselves on the first day [of Sukkot], the fruit of the beautiful [citron] tree, tightly bound branches of date palms, the branch of the braided [myrtle] tree, and willows of the brook, and you shall rejoice before the Lord your God seven days.''”<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|23:40|HE}}</ref> During the time of the [[Temple_in_Jerusalem|Temple in Jerusalem]], the waving ceremony (called ''na'anu'im'' – נענועים) was performed in the Holy Temple on all seven days of [[Sukkot|Sukkot]], and elsewhere only on the first day. Following the destruction of the Temple, Rabbi [[Yohanan_ben_Zakkai|Yohanan ben Zakkai]] ordered that the Four Species be waved everywhere on every day of Sukkot (except on [[Shabbat|Shabbat]]), as a memorial to the Temple.{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

[[File:Bundled_lulav.jpg|150px]]
To prepare the species for the [[mitzvah|mitzvah]], the ''lulav'' is first bound together with the ''hadass'' and ''aravah'' (this bundle is also referred to as "the ''lulav''") in the following manner: One ''lulav'' is placed in the center, two ''aravah'' branches are placed to the left, and three ''hadass'' boughs are placed to the right. (This order is the same for both [[right-handed|righties]] and [[left-handed|lefties]].<ref>[[Mishnah_Berurah|Mishna Berura]] 651:12 in the name of the Pri Megadim.</ref>) The bundle may be bound with strips from another palm frond, or be placed in a special holder which is also woven from palm fronds.

[[Lubavitch|Lubavitch]]er Hasidim place one ''aravah'' to the right of the ''lulav'' and the second ''aravah'' to its left, and cover them with the three ''hadass'' boughs—one on the right, the second on the left, and the third atop the ''lulav's'' spine, leaning slightly to the right. The bundle is held together with rings made from strips of palm fronds.

In all cases, all of the species must be placed in the direction in which they grew. (For the ''etrog'', this means that the stem end should be on the bottom and the blossom end on top; this is the direction in which the ''etrog'' begins to grow, though as it matures on the tree it usually hangs in the opposite direction.) -->

<!-- ==The waving ceremony==
To perform the waving ceremony, one holds the ''lulav'' apart from the ''etrog'' during the recital of the blessing. Right-handed users hold the bound ''lulav'' in the right hand and the ''etrog'' in the left hand. [[left-handed|Lefties]] have differing customs as to which hand holds the ''lulav'' and which holds the ''etrog'' before the blessing is made. An [[Ashkenazi|Ashkenazi]] lefty holds the ''lulav'' in the left hand. A [[Sephardi|Sephardi]] lefty holds the ''lulav'' in the right hand.<ref>[[Orach_Chayim|Shulchan Orach, Orach Chaim]] 651:3 and [[Moses_Isserles|Rabbi Moses Isserles' commentary]].</ref>

Before the blessing is said, the ''etrog'' is turned upside-down, opposite the direction in which it grows. The reason for this is that the blessing must precede the performance of the mitzvah. Should all the species be held in the direction in which they grew, the mitzvah would be fulfilled before the blessing is recited.

A variant custom, followed by [[Lubavitch|Lubavitch]]er Hasidim and some others, is to not hold the ''etrog'' at all while reciting the blessing, only afterwards.

After reciting the blessing, ''"Blessed are You, Lord our God, King of the universe, Who has sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us to take the lulav"'' (the ''"Shehecheyanu"'' blessing is also recited the first time each year that one waves the ''lulav'' and ''etrog''), the ''etrog'' is turned right side up (or picked up), and the user brings his or her two hands together so that the ''etrog'' touches the ''lulav'' bundle. The Four Species are then pointed and gently shaken three times toward each of the four directions, plus up and down, to attest to God's mastery over all of creation. 

An additional reason for waving the Four Species in all directions alludes to the fact that all these species require much water to grow. The ''lulav'' (date palm) grows in watered valleys, ''hadass'' and ''aravah'' grow near water sources, and the ''etrog'' requires more water than other fruit trees. By taking these particular species and waving them in all directions, the Jew symbolically voices a prayer for abundant rainfall for all the vegetation of the earth in the coming year.

The waving ceremony can be performed in the [[synagogue|synagogue]], or in the privacy of one's home or ''[[sukkah|sukkah]]'', as long as it is daytime. Women and girls may also choose to perform the [[mitzvah|mitzvah]] of waving the ''lulav'' and ''etrog'', although they are not required by [[Halakha|Halakha]] to do so.  Because women are not required to perform this mitzva, some are of the opinion that Sephardi women do not need to recite the blessing. [http://dailyhalacha.com/Display.asp?ClipID=393]

The waving is performed again (though without the attendant blessings) during morning prayer services in the [[synagogue|synagogue]], at several points during the recital of [[Hallel|Hallel]].

Additionally, in the synagogue, Hallel is followed by a further ceremony, in which the worshippers join in a processional around the sanctuary with their Four Species, while reciting special supplications (called ''hoshaanot'', from the refrain ''hosha na'', "save us"). From the first through the sixth day of Sukkot, one complete circuit is made; on [[Hoshanah_Rabbah|Hoshanah Rabbah]], the seventh and last day of Sukkot, seven complete circuits are made. As the Four Species are not used on [[Shabbat|Shabbat]], there are variant customs as to whether ''hoshaanot'' are said and a circuit made on that day. -->

<!-- ==Symbolism==
Several explanations are offered as to why these particular species were chosen for the mitzvah. The [[Midrash|Midrash]]<ref>Vayikra Rabbah 30:12.</ref> notes that the binding of the Four Species symbolizes our desire to unite the four "types" of Jews in service of God. An allusion is made to whether or not the species (or their fruits) have taste and/or smell, which correspond to Torah and good deeds. The symbolism is as follows:

*The ''lulav'' has taste but no smell, symbolizing those who study Torah but do not possess good deeds.
*The ''hadass'' has a good smell but no taste, symbolizing those who possess good deeds but do not study Torah.
*The ''aravah'' has neither taste nor smell, symbolizing those who lack both Torah and good deeds.
*The ''etrog'' has both a good taste and a good smell, symbolizing those who have both Torah and good deeds.

A second explanation<ref>ibid. 30:14.</ref> finds the four species alluding to parts of the human body. Each of the species or its leaves is similar in shape to the following organs:

*''Lulav'' – the spine
*''Hadass'' – the eye
*''Aravah'' – the mouth
*''Etrog'' – the heart

By binding them together for a [[mitzvah|mitzvah]], the Jew shows his desire to consecrate his entire being to service of God. -->

<!-- ==Selecting the four Species==
While all mitzvot should be performed in the best manner possible, ''hiddur mitzvah'' (beautifying the mitzvah) especially applies to the Four Species. The [[halacha|halacha]] is explicit on what constitutes the "best" in each species.<ref>[[Orach_Chayim|Shulchan Orach, Orach Chaim]] 645-648.</ref> To that end, people will spend large amounts of money to acquire the most perfect ''etrog'', the straightest ''lulav'', and the freshest ''hadass'' and ''aravah''. Usually a father will buy several sets of the Four Species to outfit his sons, as well.
Another custom for hiddur mitzvah is to, depending on your custom of wrapping lulav and esrog, is to have more than two aravos and three haddasim. Some people have the custom to have as many as 40 extra haddassim and aravos.

''Hiddur mitzvah'' applies to all mitzvot, but its absence does not impede the mitzvah from being performed. For the Four Species specifically, there is a further "technical" requirement of ''hadar'' (beauty), which does impede the mitzvah of the Four Species from being performed. Despite their similar names and details, these two requirements are distinct from one another. [https://web.archive.org/web/20070102005552/http://vbm-torah.org/sukkot/suk63mt.htm] -->
