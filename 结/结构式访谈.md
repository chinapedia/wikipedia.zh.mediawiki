<!-- 结构式访谈 are a means of collecting data for a [[statistical_survey|statistical survey]]s. In this case the data are collected by an interviewer rather than through a self-administered [[questionnaire|questionnaire]]. Interviewers read the questions exactly as they appear on the survey questionnaire. The choice of answers to the questions is often fixed (close-ended) in advance, though open-ended questions can also be included within a structured interview.

结构式访谈 also standardises the order in which questions are asked of survey respondents, so the questions are always answered within the same context.  This is important for minimising the impact of [[context_effects|context effects]], where the answers given to a survey question can depend on the nature of preceding questions.
