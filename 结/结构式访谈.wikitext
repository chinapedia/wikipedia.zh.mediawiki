'''结构式访谈'''（'''structured interview'''），又名'''标准化访谈'''（'''standardised interview'''），是一种[[定量研究|定量研究]]方法，通常应用于测量研究（survey research）。这种方法的目的在于确保对每一个被访者精确地呈现以同样的顺序出现的同样的问题，确保答案总体上可靠，并确信不同样本群之间或不同测量周期之间具有可比性。  

<!-- 结构式访谈 are a means of collecting data for a [[statistical_survey|statistical survey]]s. In this case the data are collected by an interviewer rather than through a self-administered [[questionnaire|questionnaire]]. Interviewers read the questions exactly as they appear on the survey questionnaire. The choice of answers to the questions is often fixed (close-ended) in advance, though open-ended questions can also be included within a structured interview.

结构式访谈 also standardises the order in which questions are asked of survey respondents, so the questions are always answered within the same context.  This is important for minimising the impact of [[context_effects|context effects]], where the answers given to a survey question can depend on the nature of preceding questions.  Though context effects can never be avoided, it is often desirable to hold them constant across all respondents. -->
