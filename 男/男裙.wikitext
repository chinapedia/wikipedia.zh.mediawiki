現今西方社會曾有人嘗試提倡男性穿裙，並企圖消除這種[[性別角色|性別角色]]的差異；但是，裙子自16世紀以來，一直被當成是女性的服裝，男性已經拋棄穿裙的習俗，因此這項倡議雖然取得有限的成功<ref>"...[despite] the best efforts of designers like Jean Paul Gaultier and others, the men's skirt has failed to gain popularity (though the kilt appears appropriate wear for men on certain special occasions)."

=== 古代 ===
Skirts have been worn since prehistoric times. They were the standard dressing for men and women in all ancient cultures in the [[近東|Near East]] and [[埃及|Egypt]].

The Kingdom of [[苏美尔|Sumer]] in [[美索不达米亚|Mesopotamia]] recorded two categories of clothing. The ritual attire for men was a fur skirt tied to a belt called {{tsl|en|Kaunakes||Kaunakes}}. The term kaunakes, which originally referred to a sheep's fleece, was later applied to the garment itself. The animal pelts originally used were replaced by kaunakes cloth, a textile that imitated fleecy sheep skin.<ref>Boucher, Francois (1987): 20,000 Years of Fashion: The History of Costume and Personal Adornment. New York: Harry N. Abrams</ref> Kaunakes cloth also served as a symbol in religious iconography, as the fleecy cloak of [[施洗約翰|St. John the Baptist]].<ref>The Bible: Genesis 12:4–5</ref><ref>Roberts, J.M. (1998): The Illustrated History of the World. Time-Life Books. Volume 1. p. 84</ref>

Depictions of kings and their attendants from the {{tsl|en|Old Assyrian Empire||Old Assyrian Empire}} and [[巴比倫尼亞|Babylonia]] on monuments like the Black Obelisk of Salmanazar show men wearing fringed cloths wrapped around their sleeved tunics.<ref>Rief Anawalt, Patricia (2007): The Worldwide History of Dress. London: Thames & Hudson. p. 22</ref>

[[古埃及|Ancient Egypt]]ian garments were mainly made of white linen.<ref>Barber, Elisabeth J.W. (1991): Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference to the Aegean. Princeton: Princeton University Press. p. 12.</ref> The exclusive use of draped linen garments, and the wearing of similar styles by men and women, remained almost unaltered as the main features of Ancient Egyptian costume. From about 2130 BC during the [[古王國時期|Old Kingdom of Egypt]], men also wore wrap around skirts (kilts) known as the {{tsl|en|shendyt||shendyt}}, They were made of a rectangular piece of cloth wrapped around the lower body and tied in front. By the [[中王國時期|Middle Kingdom of Egypt]] there was a fashion for longer kilts, almost like skirts, reaching from the waist to ankles, sometimes hanging from the armpits. During the [[新王國時期|New Kingdom of Egypt]], kilts with a pleated triangular section became fashionable for men.<ref>Rief Anawalt, Patricia (2007): The Worldwide History of Dress. London: Thames & Hudson. p. 25</ref> Beneath was worn a triangular {{tsl|en|loincloth||loincloth}}, or shente,{{which lang|date=May 2021}} whose ends were fastened with cord ties.<ref>Rief Anawalt, Patricia (2007): The Worldwide History of Dress. London: Thames & Hudson. p. 24</ref>

In [[古希腊|Ancient Greece]] the simple, sleeved T-shaped tunics were constructed of three seamed tubes of cloth, a style that originated in the Semitic Near East, along with the [[闪米特语族|Semitic]]-based word khiton, also referred to as a {{tsl|en|Chiton (costume)||chiton}}.<ref>Rief Anawalt, Patricia (2007): The Worldwide History of Dress. London: Thames & Hudson. p. 88</ref> The belted worn linen chiton was the primary garment for men and women.<ref>Rief Anawalt, Patricia (2007): The Worldwide History of Dress. London: Thames & Hudson. p. 89</ref>

The [[古罗马|Romans]] adopted many facets of Greek culture, including the same manner of dressing. The [[凯尔特人|Celts]] and [[日耳曼人|Germanic peoples]] wore a skirted garment which the historian [[西西里的狄奧多羅斯|Diodorus Siculus]] (fl. 1st century BC) called chiton. Below they wore knee-length trousers. The [[盎格魯-撒克遜人|Anglo-Saxons]], [[諾曼人|Normans]], [[法蘭克人|Franks]] and other people of Western and Northern Europe continued this fashion well into the [[中世纪|Middle Ages]], as can be seen in the [[贝叶挂毯|Bayeux Tapestry]].<ref>Koch-Mertens, Wiebke (2000): Der Mensch und seine Kleider: Die Kulturgeschichte der Mode bis 1900. Düsseldorf Zürich. Artemis & Winkler, p. 114.</ref>

[[File:1000-1100,_Norman._-_033_-_Costumes_of_All_Nations_(1882).JPG|thumb]]

Technological advances in weaving with foot-treadle floor [[织布机|loom]]s and the use of [[剪刀|scissors]] with pivoted blades and handles in the 13–15th century led to new designs. The upper part of dresses could now be tailored exactly to the body. Men's dresses were buttoned on the front and women's dresses got a [[乳溝|décolletage]]. The lower part of men's dresses were much shorter in length than those for women. They were wide cut and often pleated with an A-line so that horse riding became more comfortable. Even a [[骑士|knights]] armor had a short metal skirt below the breastplate. It covered the straps attaching the upper legs iron cuisse to the breastplate.<ref>Tortora, Phyllis et. Al.

Artemis & Winkler, pp. 156–162.</ref> Other similar garments worn by men around the world include the Greek and Balkan {{tsl|en|fustanella||fustanella}} (a short flared cotton skirt)

=== 衰退 ===
The innovative new techniques specially improved tailoring trousers and tights which designs needed more differently cut pieces of cloth than most skirts. "Real" trousers and tights increasingly replaced the prevalent use of the [[緊身褲襪|hose (clothing)]] which like stockings covered only the legs and had to be attached with garters to underpants or a {{tsl|en|doublet (clothing)||doublet}}.<ref>Koch-Mertens, Wiebke (2000): Der Mensch und seine Kleider: Die Kulturgeschichte der Mode bis 1900. Düsseldorf Zürich. Artemis & Winkler, p 130</ref> A skirt-like garment to cover the crotch and bottom were no longer necessary. In an intermediate stage to openly wearing trousers the upper classes favoured voluminous pantskirts and diverted skirts like the padded [[緊身褲襪|hose]] or the latter {{tsl|en|petticoat breeches||petticoat breeches}}.<ref>Koch-Mertens, Wiebke (2000): Der Mensch und seine Kleider: Die Kulturgeschichte der Mode bis 1900. Düsseldorf Zürich. Artemis & Winkler, pp. 216–217</ref>

Though during most of history, men and especially dominant men have been colourful in pants and skirts like Hindu [[摩诃罗阇|maharajas]] decked out in silks and diamonds or the high heeled [[路易十四|King Louis XIV]] of France with a diverted skirt, stockings and long wig.<ref>Noah Harari, Yuval (2014): Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind. Vintage-books. pp. 168, 169</ref> The [[法国大革命|French Revolution]] and the [[第一次工业革命|Industrial Revolution]] changed the dress code for men and women not only in France. From the early [[维多利亚时代|Victorian era]], there was a decline in the wearing of bright colours and luxurious fabrics by men, with a definite preference for sobriety of dress.<ref>Ribeiro, Aileen (2003): Dress and Morality. Berg Publishers. p. 169.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Organizational Behaviour and Gender|author=Fiona Margaret Wilson|pages=199|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-7546-0900-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Face of Fashion: culture studies in fashion|url=https://archive.org/details/facefashioncultu00crai|url-access=limited|author=Jennifer Craik|pages=[https://archive.org/details/facefashioncultu00crai/page/n214 200]|year=1994|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-05262-9}}</ref> This phenomenon the English psychologist {{tsl|en|John Flügel||John Flügel}} termed "The Great Masculine Renunciation".<ref>Ross, Robert (2008): Clothing: A Global History.

''"Henceforth trousers became the ultimate clothing for men to wear, while women had their essential frivolity forced on them by the dresses and skirts they were expected to wear"''.<ref>Ross, Robert (2008): Clothing: A Global History. Cambridge: Polity. p. 59</ref> By the mid-20th century, orthodox Western male dress, especially business and semi-formal dress, was dominated by sober suits, plain shirts and ties. The connotation of trousers as exclusively male has been lifted by the power of the {{tsl|en|feminist movement||feminist movement}} while the connotation of skirts as female is largely still existing leaving the Scottish [[蘇格蘭裙|kilt]] and the Albanian and Greek {{tsl|en|fustanella||fustanella}} as the only traditional men's skirts of Europe.

=== 復興 ===
In the 1960s, there was widespread reaction against the accepted North American and European conventions of male and female dress. This [[兩性共享|unisex]] fashion movement aimed to eliminate the sartorial differences between men and women. In practice, it usually meant that women would wear male dress, i.e., shirts and trousers. Men rarely went as far in the adoption of traditionally female dress modes. The furthest that most men went in the 1960s in this regard were velvet trousers, flowered or frilled shirts and ties, and long hair.<ref name=Ribeiro>{{cite book|title=Dress and Morality|author=Ribeiro, Aileen|pages=169|year=2003|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=1-85973-782-X}}</ref>

In the 1970s, David Hall, a former research engineer at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), actively promoted the use of skirts for men, appearing on both ''{{tsl|en|The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson||The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson}}'' and the ''{{tsl|en|Phil Donahue Show||Phil Donahue Show}}''. In addition, he was featured in many articles at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19800715&id=6fEvAAAAIBAJ&pg=2713,4520035|title=Lakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com}}</ref> In his essay "Skirts for Men: the advantages and disadvantages of various forms of bodily covering", he opined that men should wear skirts for both symbolic and practical reasons. Symbolically, wearing skirts would allow men to take on desirable female characteristics. In practical terms, skirts, he suggested, do not chafe around the groin, and they are more suited to warm climates.

In 1985 the French [[時尚設計|fashion designer]] [[让-保罗·高缇耶|Jean-Paul Gaultier]] created his first skirt for a men. Transgressing social codes Gaultier frequently introduces the skirt into his men's wear collections as a means of injecting novelty into male attire, most famously the sarong seen on [[大卫·贝克汉姆|David Beckham]].<ref>Fogg, Marnie (2011) ''The Fashion Design Directory''.

London: Thames & Hudson. p. 316.</ref> In the US [[馬克·雅各布斯|Marc Jacobs]] became the most prominent supporter of the skirt for men. The Milan men's fashion shows and the New York fashion shows frequently show skirts for men. {{tsl|en|Jonathan Davis||Jonathan Davis}}, the lead singer of [[Korn|Korn]], has been known to wear kilts at live shows and in music videos throughout his 18-year career with that band. [[米克·贾格尔|Mick Jagger]] from the [[滚石乐队|Rolling Stones]] and [[安東尼·基德斯|Anthony Kiedis]] from the [[嗆辣紅椒|Red Hot Chili Peppers]] were photographed wearing dresses by [[安東·寇班|Anton Corbijn]].<ref>Corbijn, Anton (2000): Werk.

[[枪与玫瑰|Guns N' Roses]]' singer, [[埃克索尔·罗斯|Axl Rose]], was known to wear men's skirts during the {{tsl|en|Use Your Illusion Tour||Use Your Illusion}} period. [[罗比·威廉斯|Robbie Williams]] and [[馬丁·戈爾|Martin Gore]] from [[流行尖端|Depeche Mode]] also performed on stage in skirts. During his Berlin time (1984–1985) Martin Gore was often seen in public wearing skirts. In an interview with the Pop Special Magazin (7/1985) he said: "Sexual barriers and gender roles are old fashioned and out. [...] I and my girlfriend often share our clothes and Make-up".

In 2008 in France, an association was created to help spur the revival of the skirt for men.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Frenchmen fighting for the right to wear skirts|work=[[衛報|The Guardian]]|date=2008-08-04|author=Lizzy Davies|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2008/aug/04/fashion.gender|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited | location=London}}</ref>

=== 大都會藝術博物館展覽 ===
In 2003, the [[大都會藝術博物館|Metropolitan Museum of Art]] displayed an exhibition, organized by {{tsl|en|Andrew Bolton (curator)||Andrew Bolton}} and {{tsl|en|Harold Koda||Harold Koda}} of the Museum's Costume Institute and sponsored by [[让-保罗·高缇耶|Gaultier]], entitled ''Bravehearts: Men in Skirts''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Bravehearts: Men in Skirts|author=Bolton, Andrew|year=2003|publisher=Harry N. Abrams|isbn=0-8109-6558-5}}</ref> The idea of the exhibition was to explore how various groups and individuals (from [[嬉皮士|hippie]]s through pop stars to fashion designers) have promoted the idea of men wearing skirts as "the future of menswear".  It displayed men's skirts on mannequins, as if in the window of a department store, in several historical and cross-cultural contexts.<ref name=Ellsworth>{{cite book|title=Places of Learning Media, Architecture, Pedagogy|url=https://archive.org/details/placeslearningme00ells_373|url-access=limited|author=Elizabeth Ann Ellsworth|pages=[https://archive.org/details/placeslearningme00ells_373/page/n153 143]–146|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-93158-4}}</ref>

The exhibition display pointed out the lack of a "natural link" between an item of clothing and the masculinity or femininity of the wearer, mentioning the [[蘇格蘭裙|kilt]] as "one of the most potent, versatile, and enduring skirt forms often looked upon by fashion designers as a symbol of a natural, uninhibited, masculinity".  It pointed out that fashion designers and male skirt-wearers employ the wearing of skirts for three purposes: to transgress conventional moral and social codes, to redefine the ideal of masculinity, and to inject novelty into male fashion.  It linked the wearing of men's skirts to youth movements and [[反文化|countercultural movement]]s such as [[朋克搖滾|punk]], [[油漬搖滾|grunge]], and [[華麗搖滾|glam rock]] and to pop-music icons such as [[佐治童子|Boy George]], [[MIYAVI|Miyavi]] and {{tsl|en|Adrian Young||Adrian Young}}.<ref name=Ellsworth /> Many male musicians have worn skirts and kilts both on and off stage. The wearing of skirts by men is also found in the [[哥德次文化|goth subculture]].

Elizabeth Ellsworth, a professor of [[媒體研究|media studies]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newschool.edu/public-engagement/faculty-list/?id=4d54-5934-4e7a-5131|title=Elizabeth Ellsworth - Professor of Media Studies - Public Engagement|website=www.newschool.edu}}</ref> eavesdropped on several visitors to the exhibition, noting that because of the exhibition's placement in a self-contained space accessed by a staircase at the far end of the museum's first floor, the visitors were primarily self-selected as those who would be intrigued enough by such an idea in the first place to actually seek it out.  According to her report, the reactions were wide-ranging, from the number of women who teased their male companions about whether they would ever consider wearing skirts (to which several men responded that they would) to the man who said, "A caftan after a shower or in the gym? Can you imagine? 'Excuse me!  Coming through!'".  An adolescent girl rejected in disgust the notion that skirts were similar to the wide pants worn by [[嘻哈|hip-hop]] artists. Two elderly women called the idea "utterly ridiculous".  One man, reading the exhibition's presentation on the subject of male skirt-wearing in cultures other than those in North America and Europe, observed, "God! Three quarters of the world's population [wear skirts]!"<ref name=Ellsworth />

The exhibition itself attempted to provoke visitors into considering how, historically, male-dress codes have come to this point and whether in fact a trend towards the wearing of skirts by men in the future actually exists.  It attempted to raise challenging questions of how a simple item of dress connotes (in Ellsworth's words) "huge ramifications in meanings, behaviours, everyday life, senses of self and others, and configurations of insider and outsider".<ref name=Ellsworth />

=== 威卡與新異教主義 ===
In [[威卡教|Wicca]] and [[新異教主義|neopaganism]], especially in the United States, men (just as women) are encouraged to question their traditional gender roles.  Amongst other things, this involves the wearing of robes at festivals and {{tsl|en|Sabbath (witchcraft)||sabbat}} celebrations as ritual clothing (which Eilers equates to the "church clothes" worn by Christians on Sundays).<ref>{{cite book|title=A Community of Witches: Contemporary Neo-paganism and Witchcraft in the United States|author=Helen A.
