'''''Pour le piano''''' (''For the piano''), [[List_of_compositions_by_Claude_Debussy_by_Lesure_number|L.]] 95, is a [[Suite_(music)|suite]] for solo piano by [[Claude_Debussy|Claude Debussy]]. It consists of three individually composed [[Movement_(music)|movement]]s, Prélude, Sarabande and Toccata. The suite was completed and published in 1901. It was premiered on 11 January 1902 at the [[Salle_Érard|Salle Érard]], played by [[Ricardo_Viñes|Ricardo Viñes]]. [[Maurice_Ravel|Maurice Ravel]] orchestrated the middle movement.<ref name="Lesure" />

Regarded as Debussy's first mature piano composition, the suite has frequently been recorded. [[Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter]] published a critical edition in 2018, on the occasion of the centenary of Debussy's death.

[[Claude_Debussy|Claude Debussy]] composed the three pieces forming the suite at different times. The second [[Movement_(music)|movement]], a [[sarabande|sarabande]], dates to the winter of 1894 when it belonged to the series of ''Images oubliées'',<ref>[https://imslp.org/wiki/Images_oubli%C3%A9es_(Debussy,_Claude) Images oubliées] (IMSLP)</ref> dedicated to Yvonne Lerolle, the daughter of [[Henry_Lerolle|Henry Lerolle]].<ref name = "Lesure"/><ref name="BBF" /> Debussy composed little piano music during the 1890s and focused on opera and orchestral music.<ref name="Trezise" /> He completed the suite in 1901, revising Sarabande.<ref name="Hewitt" /> He also dedicated the revised version of Sarabande, as well as the third movement, Toccata, to Yvonne Lerolle, now Mme E. Rouart.<ref name="BBF" /> The suite was published in 1901 by Eugène Fromont.<ref>[http://data.bnf.fr/14842346/eugene_fromont/ Eugène Fromont] (BnF)</ref><ref name="Bärenreiter" /> It was premiered on 11 January 1902 at the [[Salle_Érard|Salle Érard]] in Paris for the [[Société_Nationale_de_Musique|Société Nationale de Musique]].<ref name="Lesure" /> [[Ricardo_Viñes|Ricardo Viñes]] was the pianist, who knew about the suite from his friend [[Maurice_Ravel|Maurice Ravel]].<ref name="Hewitt" />

''Pour le piano'' marked a turning point in Debussy's creative development, who now turned to a prolific production of piano music.<ref name="Trezise" />

On the occasion of the centenary of Debussy's death, [[Bärenreiter|Bärenreiter]] published in 2018 a critical edition of some of his piano music, including ''Pour le piano''.<ref name="Focus" /> The publisher remarked that the "improvisational and fugitive" parts of Debussy's compositions were "governed by a precisely calibrated formal design" that left "little room for chance".<ref name="Focus" />

''Pour le piano'' has been regarded as Debussy's first mature piano work.<ref name="Howell" /> The suite consists of three movements:<ref name="BBF" />
# Prélude
# Sarabande
# Toccata

The first movement, called [[Prelude_(music)|Prélude]], is marked "Assez animé et très rythmé" (With spirit and very rhythmically).<ref name="Keillor" /> It was dedicated to Debussy's student Mlle Worms de Romilly, who notes that the movement "tellingly evokes the gongs and music of [[Java|Java]]".<ref name="Lesure" /> The pianist [[Angela_Hewitt|Angela Hewitt]] notes that Prélude begins with a [[Theme_(music)|theme]] in the bass, followed by a long [[pedal_point|pedal point]] passage. The theme is repeated in chords marked [[fortissimo|fortissimo]], together with [[glissando|glissando]] runs that Debussy connected to "d’Artagnan drawing his sword".<ref name="Hewitt" /> In a middle section, the left hand holds a pedal point in [[A-flat_whole-tone|A-flat whole-tone]], to which the right hand adds colours. The conclusion is marked "Tempo di cadenza", again with glissando-figures.<ref name = "Hewitt" />

Sarabande is marked "Avec une élégance grave et lente" (With a slow and solemn elegance).<ref name="Keillor" /> Debussy said it should be "rather like an old portrait in the Louvre".<ref name="Hewitt" /> [[Émile_Vuillermoz|Émile Vuillermoz]] described Debussy's playing of the movement as "with the easy simplicity of a good dancer from the sixteenth century".<ref name="Hewitt" /> Hewitt calls it "antique and modern at the same time".<ref name="Hewitt" /> The movement has been regarded as "among the most intimate music for the keyboard",<ref name="Keillor" /> showing an affinity to [[Erik_Satie|Erik Satie]] such as his 1887 three dances called ''[[Sarabandes_(Satie)|Sarabandes]]''.<ref name="Keillor" />

The last movement is a [[toccata|toccata]], marked "Vif" (Lively).<ref name="Keillor" /> <!-- It was dedicated to Nicolas Coronio, another student of Debussy.<ref name="Lesure"/> - not supported by BNF --> It has been described as "poised and energetic, extroverted and graceful" and shows influences from [[Domenico_Scarlatti|Scarlatti]]'s sonatas.<ref name="Keillor" /> Hewitt notes about the virtuoso writing that speed alone wasn't Debussy's goal, but rather clarity.<ref name="Hewitt" />

A reviewer described the suite as "possibly foreshadowing the neo-classical Debussy that emerged in his last years".<ref name="Howell" />

== Recordings ==
''Pour le piano'' has been recorded often,<ref name="Keillor" /> sometimes in recordings of all piano music by Debussy, such as by [[Walter_Gieseking|Walter Gieseking]] in the 1950s and by [[Noriko_Ogawa_(pianist)|Noriko Ogawa]] in the 2010s.<ref name="Howell" /> Angela Hewitt recorded it, along with other music by Debussy, in 2011.<ref name="Hewitt" /> Several pianists' recordings were published in 2018, the year of the centenary of the composer's death, including [[Jörg_Demus|Jörg Demus]], [[Peter_Frankl|Peter Frankl]], [[Rafał_Blechacz|Rafał Blechacz]] and [[Samson_François|Samson François]] within recordings of the composer's complete piano works.<ref name="Keillor" />
