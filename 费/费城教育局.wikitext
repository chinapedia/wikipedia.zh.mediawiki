Why, in December 2009, nearly 30 Asian students were violently assaulted, 13 of them rushed to the emergency room. Or how an incompetent, and, as it turns out, uncertified, principal reigned complacent through years of hostility." [...] "The events at South Philadelphia High School transformed the Ly brothers into activists, though Duong Thang disclaims the label. Having experienced the violence firsthand, they joined dozens of other Asian students in an eight-day boycott and brought legal and political pressure upon the school district, building a movement along the way."</ref>，全因先前在2009年12月3日，一些南费城高中学生攻击了一些同校的亚裔美国学生。<ref>Gammage, Jeff.

The violence sent seven Asians to hospitals and led about 50 to stage a weeklong boycott."</ref>
