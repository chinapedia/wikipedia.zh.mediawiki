[[Image:Stiftshuette_Modell_Timnapark.jpg|thumb]]中的会幕模型。]]

'''会幕'''（{{lang-he|'''משכן'''}}，{{transl|he|Mishkan}}，意为“神的居所”；{{lang-la|''Tabernaculum''}}，意为“帐篷”；{{lang-en|'''Tabernacle'''}}），根据[[希伯來聖經|希伯來聖經]]，是自《[[出埃及记|出埃及记]]》中[[希伯来人|希伯来人]]离开古[[埃及|埃及]]以後到征服[[迦南|迦南]]地之前的一个时期的一个流动的敬拜{{YHWH}}的中心场所。會幕記載於[[舊約聖經|舊約聖經]]出埃及記第26章和第36章當中，并在[[士师记|士师记]]时代征服[[迦南|迦南]]地，直到300年之后的前10世纪时最终按耶和華指示的样式建造了[[耶路撒冷圣殿|耶路撒冷圣殿]]才被替代，也就是所謂的[[第一聖殿|第一聖殿]]。

== 词源 ==
在希伯来语中，'''Mishkan'''与居住或休息有关，指“上帝居住其中”的规定的神圣建筑。 

希伯来语中，邻居（shakhen）一词也源自于'''mishkan'''。在[[出埃及记|出埃及记]]中，{{YHWH}}指示[[摩西|摩西]]建造的详细要求：“他们当为我造圣所，使我可以住在他们中间。制造帐幕和其中的一切器具，都要照我所指示你的样式。” <ref>{{Bible|出埃及记|25|8-9}}</ref>。这也意味着，自从[[出埃及记|出埃及记]]以后，{{YHWH}}就住在以色列人之中。

这对于理解许多[[犹太教|犹太教]]的根基，例如[[安息日|安息日]]、[[犹太教祭司|犹太教祭司]]，以及[[金牛犊|金牛犊]]的罪的意义与赎罪，都至关重要。

==内容==

== 建筑者 ==
据{{Bible|出埃及记|31}}，{{YHWH}}指定了主要的建筑师：“{{YHWH}}告诉摩西说，看哪，[[犹大支派|犹大支派]]中，户珥的孙子，乌利的儿子[[比撒列|比撒列]]，我已经题名召他。我也已经以神的灵充满他，使他有智慧，有悟性，有知识，能作各样的工，能设计奇巧的工，用金、银、铜制造各物；又能刻宝石，可以镶嵌，能雕木头，能作各样的工。我已经亲自分派[[但支派|但支派]]中，亚希撒抹的儿子[[亚何利亚伯|亚何利亚伯]]与他[[同工|同工]]；凡心中有智慧的，我已赐他们心中有智慧，能作我所吩咐你的一切，就是会幕、[[约柜|见证的柜]]和其上的遮罪盖、会幕的一切器具，桌子和桌子的器具、纯金的灯台和灯台的一切器具、香坛，燔祭坛和坛的一切器具、洗濯盆和盆座，精工作的衣服，就是祭司亚伦的圣衣，和他儿子们用以作祭司事奉的衣服，膏油和供圣所用馨香香料的香。他们都要照我所吩咐你的一切去作。”<ref>{{Bible|出埃及记|31|1-11}}[http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=31] {{Wayback|url=http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=31 |date=20160425231631 }}</ref>
 
<!-- == 组织 ==
会幕 of the Hebrews, during the Exodus, was a portable worship facility comprised of a tent draped with colorful curtains, see diagram:  [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mishkan/1.htm]. 
It had a rectangular, perimeter fence of fabric, poles and staked cords. This rectangle was always erected when they would camp, oriented to the east. In the center of this enclosure was a rectangular sanctuary draped with goats'-hair curtains, and the roof was made from rams' skins, see diagram: [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mishkan/2.htm].
Inside, it was divided into two areas,[[圣所|圣所]]和[[至圣所|至圣所]]. See diagram: [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mishkan/3.htm] These two 'compartments were separated by a curtain or veil. Entering the first space, one would see 3 pieces of sacred furniture: a seven-branched oil lampstand on the left (south), a table for twelve loaves of show bread on the right (north) and straight ahead before the dividing curtain (west) was an altar for incense-burning. Beyond this curtain was the cube-shaped inner room known as the 至圣所（kodesh hakodashim）。This sacred space contained a single article called [[约柜|约柜]] (''aron habrit''), see diagram: [http://www.daat.ac.il/daat/tanach/mishkan/10.htm]. -->

==耶路撒冷圣殿==
[[大卫王|大卫王]]征服[[耶路撒冷|耶路撒冷]]后，他的儿子[[所罗门王|所罗门王]]建造了第一圣殿——[[所罗门圣殿|所罗门圣殿]]，会幕所有的内容都包括进新建的永久建筑圣殿中。

==安息日==
{{Bible|出埃及记|31}}记载了会幕建筑的完成[http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=31]，<!-- 同一章, immediately following the words about the Tabernacle, God reminds Moses about the importance of [[安息日|安息日]]： 
:"God told Moses to speak to the Israelites and say to them: You must still keep my sabbaths. It is a sign between me and you for all generations, to make you realize that I, God, am making you holy. Keep the Sabbath as something sacred to you. Anyone doing work shall be cut off spiritually from his people, and therefore, anyone violating it shall be put to death. Do your work during the six week days, but keep Saturday as a Sabbath of sabbaths, holy to God. Whoever does any work on Saturday shall be put to death. The Israelites shall thus keep the Sabbath, making it a day of rest for all generations, as an eternal covenant. It is a sign between me and the Israelites that during the six weekdays God made heaven and earth, but on Saturday, he ceased working and rested." (Exodus: 31: 12-17). [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=31]
The rabbis of the [[Mishna|Mishna]] derive from this juxtaposition of subject-matter, the fact that the commandment to rest on the Sabbath day, as stated in Genesis 2:1-3 "Heaven and earth, and all their components, were completed. With the seventh day, God finished all the work that He had done. He ceased on the seventh day from all the work that he had been doing. God blessed the seventh day, and he declared it to be holy, for it was on this day that God ceased from all the work that he
had been creating to function." [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=1&CHAPTER=2] is not pushed aside by the commandments to construct the Tabernacle. Not only that, but the very definition of what constitutes "work" or "actvity" that must not be done by any Israelite, on pain of death (only when there was a [[Sanhedrin|Sanhedrin]], and only with acceptable witnesses present), is defined by the [[39_categories_of_activity_prohibited_on_Shabbat|39 categories of activity]] needed for the construction of the Tabernacle and for its functioning as the center of the sacrifices enumerated in [[利未记|利未记]]。 -->

== 与[[金牛犊|金牛犊]]的关系==
<!-- Some rabbis have commented on the proximity of the narrative of the Tabernacle with that of the episode known as the sin of the [[Golden_Calf|Golden Calf]] which begins in the [[Book_of_Exodus|Book of Exodus]] 32:1-6 [http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&BOOK=2&CHAPTER=32]. [[Maimonides|Maimonides]] asserts that the Tabernacle and its accoutrements, such as the golden [[Ark_of_the_Covenant|Ark of the Covenant]] and the golden [[Menorah|Menorah]] were meant as "alternates" to the human weakness and needs for physical idols as seen in the Golden Calf episode. Others scholars, such as [[Nachmanides|Nachmanides]] disagree and maintain that the Tabernacle's meaning is not tied in with the Golden Calf but instead symbolizes higher mystical lessons that symbolize God's constant closeness to the Children of Israel. -->

==犹太会堂的模型==
此后2000年间[[犹太会堂|犹太会堂]]的建筑都模仿起初的会幕和耶路撒冷圣殿，每个会堂都有<!--  its front an ark, ''aaron kodesh'',  containing the [[Torah|Torah]] scrolls comparable to [[约柜|约柜]] which contained the tablets with [[十诫|十诫]]. This is the holiest spot in a synagogue equivalent to [[至圣所|至圣所]]. --> 
[[File:YarmulkeAndMenorah.jpg|right]]
<!-- There is also usually a constantly lighted lamp, ''ner tamid'', or a candelabrum lighted during services, near this spot similar to the original [[Menorah|Menorah]]. At the center of the synagogue is a large elevated area, known as the ''bimah'' where the Torah is read. This is equivalent to the Tabernacle's altars upon which incense and animal sacrifices were offered. On the main holidays [[Kohen|priests]], ''kohanim'', gather at the front of the synagogue to bless the congregation as did their priestly ancestors in the Tabernacle from [[亚伦|亚伦]] onwards. -->

==会幕中的祷告==
祭司每天两次站在金香坛前祷告、烧香。<!-- Other procedures were also carried out in 会幕。 -->

==其他用途==

在加拿大魁北克的法语中，tarbanak一词是最强力的脏话。
魁北克法语的脏话都与天主教的圣物有关，详见[[:寂静革命|:寂静革命]]
<!-- Within [[罗马天主教|罗马天主教]], a tabernacle is a cupboard or boxlike receptical for the exclusive reservation of the blessed [[Sacrament|Sacrament]] - the bread and wine used during the rite of [[Holy_Communion|Holy Communion]]. In the [[Early_Church|Early Christian]] times such tabernacles containing the ''sacred species'' were kept within private houses where [[Christianity|Christians]] met for church, for fear of possible persecution.

The Tabernacle is also seen in some Christian circles as representing [[基督|基督]][[耶稣|耶稣]].{{fact|date=February 2007}}

In [[Seventh-day_Adventist_theology|Seventh-day Adventist theology]], emphasis is placed on understanding the earthly sanctuary as a symbol or [[Typology_(theology)|type]] of the "[[heavenly_sanctuary|heavenly sanctuary]]". -->
