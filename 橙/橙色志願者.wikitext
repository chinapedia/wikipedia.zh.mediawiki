'''橙色志願者'''([[英語|英語]]：'''Orange Volunteers'''或簡稱'''OV''')， 是位於[[北愛爾蘭|北愛爾蘭]]的北愛親英分子及[[基督教基要主義|基督教基要主義]]的[[準軍事部隊|準軍事部隊]]。

==起源==
橙色志願者在1998年的{{le|德拉姆克里衝突|Drumcree conflict}}中出現，但有證據表明，他們早在1985年一直在積極招募和培訓人員<ref name="#1">''Northern Ireland - The Troubles'' by Charles Messenger (ISBN 0-86124-236-X), p. 141.</ref>。該小組被認為不贊成北愛爾蘭和平進程及在[[橙带党|橙带党]]中較為激進的成員。<ref name="#1"/>
<!-- The OV emerged during the 1998 [[Drumcree_conflict|Drumcree conflict]] when the [[Royal_Ulster_Constabulary|Royal Ulster Constabulary]] and [[British_Army|British Army]] prevented members of the [[Portadown|Portadown]] [[Orange_Institution|Orange Order]] and their supporters from returning to the town centre down the Garvaghy road. However there is evidence to suggest that they had been actively recruiting and training members since as early as 1985<ref>''Northern Ireland - The Troubles'' by Charles Messenger (ISBN 0-86124-236-X), p. 141.</ref>. The group is believed to be made up of dissident Loyalists who disapprove of the [[Northern_Ireland_peace_process|Northern Ireland peace process]] and also of the more militant members of the Orange Order<ref>''Northern Ireland - The Troubles'' by Charles Messenger (ISBN 0-86124-236-X), p. 141.</ref>, including former members of the [[Loyalist_Volunteer_Force|Loyalist Volunteer Force]] and [[Ulster_Defence_Association|Ulster Defence Association]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Orange Volunteers | author = | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/oorgan.htm#ov | publisher = CAIN Web Service (Conflict Archive on the Internet)''}}</ref> [[David_Ervine|David Ervine]], at the time a leading member of the [[Progressive_Unionist_Party|Progressive Unionist Party]], described the group as little more than a gang of Protestant fundamentalists and drug-dealers.<ref>http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch99.htm</ref> -->
==活動==
他們主要攻擊在[[北愛|北愛]]的[[天主教|天主教]]教堂及商業設施。
<!-- They are known for attacks on [[Roman_Catholic_Church|Catholic]] churches and businesses in Northern Ireland, in an attempt to prevent political settlements with [[Irish_nationalism|nationalists]]. One of its first actions was a synchronised attack on 11 Catholic churches, justified by its then-leader, Clifford Peeples,  because they were "bastions of the [[Antichrist|Antichrist]]." However Peeples denies being a bigot saying that he despises Roman Catholicism, but individual Catholics he likes and loves. Several [[pipe_bomb|pipe bomb]] attacks were attributed to them. It has been reported that they have enough guns and explosives to maintain a ten year campaign.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It is thought the group can call on up to 300 Active members.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The organisation has six battalions- one in each county - with a command structure based on the British Army.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} -->

<!-- In a series of police raids aimed at dissident loyalists in Autumn 1999, eight arrests were made, weapons, pipe bombs and ammunition were recovered and a search of [[Stoneyford,_County_Antrim|Stoneyford]] [[Orange_Hall|Orange Hall]] in County Antrim uncovered military files containing the personal details of over 300 [[Irish_republicanism|republicans]] from South Armagh and [[Belfast|Belfast]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Sinn Féin collusion claim

In a statement the OV declared that innocent Catholics had nothing to fear from them, and they will only go after legitimate targets. However, some of their attacks have contradicted this. Almost all of their attacks have been on innocent civilians and they have also targeted Sinn Féin members.

The group declared a [[ceasefire|ceasefire]] in 2000. In February 2001, the group called off its ceasefire with a "back to war" statement. -->
