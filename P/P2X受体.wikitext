==Tissue distribution==

P2X receptors are expressed in cells from a wide variety of animal [[组织_(生物学)|tissues]]. On presynaptic and postsynaptic {{tsl|en|chemical synapse||nerve terminals}} and [[神經膠質細胞|glial]] cells throughout the [[中樞神經系統|central]], [[周围神经系统|peripheral]] and [[自主神经系统|autonomic]] nervous systems, P2X receptors have been shown to modulate {{tsl|en|chemical synapse||synaptic transmission}}.<ref name="North"/><ref name="pmid10823099">{{cite journal | author = Burnstock G | title = P2X receptors in sensory neurones | journal = Br J Anaesth | volume = 84 | issue = 4 | pages = 476–88 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10823099 | doi = | issn = | url = http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/84/4/476 }}</ref> Furthermore, P2X receptors are able to initiate [[肌肉收缩|contraction]] in cells of the [[心肌|heart muscle]], [[骨骼肌|skeletal muscle]], and various [[平滑肌|smooth muscle]] tissues, including that of the [[循环系统|vasculature]], [[输精管|vas deferens]] and [[膀胱|urinary bladder]]. P2X receptors are also expressed on [[白血球|leukocytes]], including lymphocytes and macrophages, and are present on blood [[血小板|platelet]]s. There is some degree of subtype specificity as to which P2X receptor subtypes are expressed on specific cell types, with P2X<sub>1</sub> receptors being particularly prominent in smooth muscle cells, and P2X<sub>2</sub> being widespread throughout the autonomic nervous system. However, such trends are very general and there is considerable overlap in subunit distribution, with most cell types expressing more than one subunits. For example, P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>3</sub> subunits are commonly found co-expressed in [[感覺神經元|sensory neuron]]s, where they often co-assemble into functional P2X<sub>2/3</sub> receptors.

==Basic structure and nomenclature==

To date, seven separate genes coding for P2X subunits have been identified, and named to as '''P2X<sub>1</sub>''' through '''P2X<sub>7</sub>'''.<ref name="North"/><ref name="Gever">{{cite journal | author = Gever JR, Cockayne DA, Dillon MP, Burnstock G, Ford AP | title = Pharmacology of P2X channels | journal = Pflugers Arch. | volume = 452 | issue = 5 | pages = 513–37 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16649055 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-006-0070-9 | issn = }}</ref>

The subunits all share a common topology, possessing two [[细胞膜|plasma membrane]] spanning domains, a large extracellular loop and intracellular [[C端|carboxyl]] and [[N端|amino]] termini (Figure 1)<ref>{{cite pmid | 12270951}}</ref> The amino termini contain a consensus site for [[蛋白激酶C|protein kinase C]] phosphorylation, indicating that the phosphorylation state of P2X subunits may be involved in receptor functioning.<ref>{{cite pmid | 10744703}}</ref> Additionally, there is a great deal of variability in the C termini, indicating that they might serve subunit specific properties.<ref>{{cite pmid | 18851707}}</ref>

Generally speaking, most subunits can form functional {{tsl|en|homomeric||homomeric}} or {{tsl|en|heteromer||heteromer}}ic receptors.<ref>{{cite pmid | 22547202}}</ref> Receptor nomenclature dictates that naming is determined by the constituent subunits; e.g. a homomeric P2X receptor made up of only P2X<sub>1</sub> subunits is called a P2X<sub>1</sub> receptor, and a heteromeric receptor containing P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>3</sub> subunits is called a P2X<sub>2/3</sub> receptor. The general consensus is that P2X<sub>6</sub> cannot form a functional homomeric receptor and that P2X<SUB>7</SUB> cannot form a functional heteromeric receptor.<ref>{{cite pmid | 15657042}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid | 10037762}}</ref>

Evidence from early molecular biological and functional studies has strongly indicated that the functional P2X receptor protein is a {{tsl|en|Trimer (biochemistry)||trimer}}, with the three peptide [[蛋白质亚基|subunits]] arranged around an ion-permeable channel pore.<ref name="pmid9606184">{{cite journal | author = Nicke A, Baumert HG, Rettinger J, Eichele A, Lambrecht G, Mutschler E, Schmalzing G | title = P2X1 and P2X3 receptors form stable trimers: a novel structural motif of ligand-gated ion channels | journal = EMBO J. | volume = 17 | issue = 11 | pages = 3016–28 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9606184 | pmc = 1170641 | doi=10.1093/emboj/17.11.3016 | issn = }}</ref> This view was recently confirmed by the use of [[X射线晶体学|X-ray crystallography]] to resolve the [http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=3I5D three-dimensional structure] of the [[斑馬魚|zebrafish]] P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor<ref name="pmid19641588">{{cite journal | author = Kawate T, Michel JC, Birdsong WT, Gouaux E.| title = Crystal structure of the ATP-gated P2X4 ion channel in the closed state | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue =  7255| pages = 592–598 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19641588 | pmc = 2720809 | doi=10.1038/nature08198 | issn = }}</ref>(Figure 2). These findings indicate that the second transmembrane domain of each subunit lines the ion-conducting pore and is therefore responsible for channel {{tsl|en|Gating (electrophysiology)||gating}}.<ref>{{cite pmid | 11402044}}</ref>

The relationship between the structure and function of P2X receptors has been the subject of considerable research, and key protein domains responsible for regulating ATP binding, ion permeation, pore dilation and desensitization have been identified.<ref name="pmid16708237">{{cite journal | author = Egan TM, Samways DS, Li Z | title = Biophysics of P2X receptors | journal = Pflugers Arch. | volume = 452 | issue = 5 | pages = 501–12 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16708237 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-006-0078-1 | issn = }}</ref><ref name="pmid16607539">{{cite journal | author = Roberts JA, Vial C, Digby HR, Agboh KC, Wen H, Atterbury-Thomas A, Evans RJ | title = Molecular properties of P2X receptors | journal = Pflugers Arch. | volume = 452 | issue = 5 | pages = 486–500 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16607539 | doi = 10.1007/s00424-006-0073-6 | issn = }}</ref>

==Activation and channel opening==

Three ATP  molecules are thought to be required to activate a P2X receptor, suggesting that ATP needs to bind to each of the three subunits in order to open the channel pore, though recent evidence suggests that ATP binds at the three subunit interfaces.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Evans RJ | title = Orthosteric and allosteric binding sites of P2X receptors | journal = Eur. Biophys. J. | volume = 38 | issue = 3 | pages = 319–27 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18247022 | doi = 10.1007/s00249-008-0275-2 | issn = }}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid | 10228183}}</ref> Once ATP binds to the extracellular loop of the P2X receptor, it evokes a [[構象改變|conformational change]] in the structure of the ion channel that results in the opening of the ion-permeable pore. The most commonly accepted theory of channel opening involves the rotation and separation of the second transmembrane domain (TM) helices, allowing cations such as [[钠|Na<sup>+</sup>]] and [[钙|Ca<sup>2+</sup>]] to access the ion-conducting pore through three lateral fenestrations above the TM domains.<ref>{{cite pmid | 19906973}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid | 21624948}}</ref> The entry of cations leads to the [[去极化|depolarization]] of the cell membrane and the activation of various Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive intracellular processes.<ref>{{cite pmid| 15044552}}</ref><ref>{{cite pmid | 11040040}}</ref> The channel opening time is dependent upon the subunit makeup of the receptor.  For example, P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>3</sub> receptors {{tsl|en|Desensitization (medicine)||desensitize}} rapidly (a few hundred milliseconds) in the continued presence of ATP, whereas the P2X<sub>2</sub> receptor channel remains open for as long as ATP is bound to it.

==Pharmacology==

The pharmacology of a given P2X receptor is largely determined by its subunit makeup.<ref name="Gever"/> Different subunits exhibit different sensitivities to purinergic agonists such as ATP, '''α,β-meATP''' and '''BzATP'''; and antagonists such as pyridoxalphosphate-6-azophenyl-2',4'-disulphonic acid ('''{{tsl|en|PPADS||PPADS}}''') and {{tsl|en|suramin||suramin}}.<ref name=North /> Of continuing interest is the fact that some P2X  receptors (P2X<sub>2</sub>, P2X<sub>4</sub>, human P2X<sub>5</sub>, and P2X<sub>7</sub>) exhibit multiple open states in response to ATP, characterized by a time-dependent increase in the permeabilities of large organic ions such as N-methyl-D-glucamine (NMDG<sup>+</sup>) and nucleotide binding dyes such as {{tsl|en|propidium iodide||propidium iodide}} (YO-PRO-1). Whether this change in permeability is due to a widening of the P2X receptor channel pore itself or the opening of a separate ion-permeable pore is the subject of continued investigation.<ref>{{cite pmid| 12270951}}</ref>

==Synthesis and Trafficking==

P2X receptors are synthesized in the rough [[内质网|endoplasmic reticulum]]. After complex glycosylation in the [[高尔基体|Golgi apparatus]], they are transported to the plasma membrane whereby docking is achieved through specific members of the {{tsl|en|SNARE (protein)||SNARE protein}} family.<ref>{{cite pmid |22547202}}</ref>  A YXXXK {{tsl|en|sequence motif||motif}} in the C terminus is common to all P2X subunits and seems to be important for {{tsl|en|Protein targeting||trafficking}} and stabilization of P2X receptors in the membrane.<ref>{{cite pmid|15126501}}</ref>  Removal of P2X receptors occurs via {{tsl|en|clathrin||clathrin}}-mediated [[內吞作用|endocytosis]] of receptors to [[核内体|endosomes]] where they are sorted into [[囊泡|vesicles]] for degradation or recycling.<ref>{{cite pmid | 12105201}}</ref>

==Allosteric modulation==

The sensitivity of P2X receptors to ATP is strongly modulated by changes in extracellular pH and by the presence of heavy metals (e.g. zinc and cadmium). For example, the ATP sensitivity of P2X<sub>1</sub>, P2X<sub>3</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors is attenuated when the extracellular pH<7, whereas the ATP sensitivity of P2X<sub>2</sub> is significantly increased. On the other hand, zinc potentiates ATP-gated currents through P2X<sub>2</sub>, P2X<sub>3</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub>, and inhibits currents through P2X<sub>1</sub>. The [[别构调节|allosteric modulation]] of P2X receptors by pH and metals appears to be conferred by the presence of histidine side chains in the extracellular domain.<ref name="North"/> In contrast to the other members of the P2X receptor family, P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors are also very sensitive to modulation by the macrocyclic lactone, [[伊維菌素|ivermectin]].<ref>{{cite journal | author = Khakh BS, Proctor W, Dunwiddie TV, Labarca C, Lester HA | title = Allosteric control of gating and kinetics at P2X(4) receptor channels | journal = J.
