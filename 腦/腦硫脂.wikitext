==腦硫脂歷史==
腦硫脂是第一個從人[[脑|脑]]中分離出來的"磺胺醣脂"(sulfoglycolipid)。<!--It was named sulfatide in 1884 by [[Johann_Ludwig_Wilhelm_Thudichum|Johann Ludwig Wilhelm Thudichum]] when he published "A Treatist of the Chemical Constitution of the Brain".<ref name= Eckhardt/> Originally, in 1933, it was first reported by Blix that sulfatide contained [[amide|amide]] bound [[fatty_acid|fatty acid]] and 4-sphingenine and that the [[sulfate|sulfate]] of sulfatide was thought to be attached to the C6 position of [[galactose|galactose]].<ref name=Takahashi/><ref name= Suzuki/>-->於1955年再次得到"桑豪社"(Thannhauser)和"施密特"(Schmidt)支持；然而，通過[[气相色谱法|气相色谱法]]，"山口山村"(Tamio Yamakawa)發現[[硫酸鹽|硫酸鹽]]實際上附著在[[半乳糖|半乳糖]]的C3位置，而不是C6位置。<ref name=Suzuki>{{Cite journal|author=Suzuki, A.|title=Tamio Yamakawa: Dawn of glycobiology. |journal=J.

==硫脂合成與降解==
[[File:Synthesis_of_sulfatide.jpg|thumb]]

腦硫脂合成開始於[[尿苷二磷酸半乳糖|尿苷二磷酸半乳糖]](UDP-半乳糖)與2-羥基化、或非羥基化[[神經酰胺|神經酰胺]]之間的反應。<!--This reaction is catalyzed by [[galactosyltransferase|galactosyltransferase]] (CGT), where [[galactose|galactose]] is transferred to 2-hydroxylated, or non-hydroxylated [[ceramide|ceramide]], from [[UDP-galactose|UDP-galactose]].<ref name=Eckhardt>{{Cite journal|author=Eckhardt, Matthias|title=The Role and Metabolism of Sulfatide in the Nervous System. |journal=Molecular Neurobiolog |volume=37 |issue=2-3 |pages=93–103 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18465098|doi= 10.1007/s12035-008-8022-3|url=http://0-search.proquest.com.libus.csd.mu.edu/docview/214790628?accountid=100}}</ref> This reaction occurs in the luminal leaflet of the [[endoplasmic_reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]], and its final product is GalCer, or galactocerebroside, which is then transported to the [[Golgi_apparatus|Golgi apparatus]].<ref name=Eckhardt/><ref name=Xiao>{{cite journal|last1=Xiao|first1=S|last2=Finkielstein|first2=CV|last3=Capelluto|first3=DG|title=The enigmatic role of sulfatides: new insights into cellular functions and mechanisms of protein recognition.|journal=Advances in experimental medicine and biology|date=2013|volume=991|pages=27–40|pmid=23775689}}</ref> Here, GalCer reacts with [[3'-Phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate|3’-phosphoadenosine-5’-phosphosulfate]] ([[PAPS|PAPS]]) to make sulfatide.

磺酰胺類降解發生在[[溶酶体|溶酶体]]中。這裡，[[芳基硫酸酯酶A|芳基硫酸酯酶A]]水解[[硫酸鹽|硫酸鹽]]基團。<ref name=Eckhardt/>然而，為了使該反應進能夠進行，{{le|鞘脂激活蛋白原|Prosaposin}}比如鞘糖蛋白B必須存在。<ref name=Xiao/> <!--Saposin B extracts sulfatide from the membrane, which makes it accessible to [[arylsulfatase_A|arylsulfatase A]].<ref name=Eckhardt/> [[Arylsulfatase_A|Arylsulfatase A]] can then [[hydrolyze|hydrolyze]] the sulfate group. Accumulation of sulfatide can cause [[Metachromatic_Leukodystrophy|Metachromatic Leukodystrophy]], a [[lysosomal_storage_disease|lysosomal storage disease]] and may be caused because of a defect in [[arylsulfatase_A|arylsulfatase A]], leading to an inability to degrade sulfatide.<ref name=Xiao/><ref name=Takahashi>{{cite journal|title=Role of sulfatide in normal and pathological cells and tissues|date=2012-08-01|doi=10.1194/jlr.r026682|language=en|journal=Journal of Lipid Research|volume=53|issue=8|url=http://www.jlr.org/content/53/8/1437|pages=1437–1450|issn=0022-2275|accessdate=2018-04-02|author=Tadanobu Takahashi, Takashi Suzuki}}</ref>

==硫脂的生物學功能==
<!--Sulfatide participates in many biological systems and functions including the [[nervous_system|nervous system]], the [[immune_system|immune system]], and in [[haemostasis|haemostasis]]/ [[thrombosis|thrombosis]].-->腦硫脂也被證明在[[腎|腎]]臟中起了次要的作用。

===神經系統===
[[Image:Myelinated_neuron.jpg|thumb]]下的圖像]]

腦硫脂是[[神经系统|神经系统]]中的主要成分，並且在[[周围神经系统|周围神经系统]]以及[[中樞神經系統|中樞神經系統]]中的[[髓磷脂|髓鞘]]中發現含有高水平的腦硫脂。<!--[[Myelin|Myelin]] is typically composed of about 70 -75% [[lipids|lipids]], and sulfatide comprises 4-7% of this 70-75%.<ref name=Xiao/> When lacking sulfatide, [[myelin_sheath|myelin sheath]] is still produced around the [[axon|axon]]s; however, when lacking sulfatide the lateral loops and part of the [[nodes_of_Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]] are disorganized, so the [[myelin_sheath|myelin sheath]] does not function properly.<ref name=Honke/> -->因此，缺乏腦硫脂可導致肌肉無力、[[顫抖|顫抖]]及[[失調|共濟失調]]。<ref name=Honke/>
<!--
Elevated levels of sulfatide are also associated with [[Metachromatic_Leukodystrophy|Metachromatic Leukodystrophy]], which leads to the progressive loss of myelin as a result of sulfatide accumulation in the [[Schwann_cells|Schwann cells]], [[oligodendrocytes|oligodendrocytes]], [[astrocytes|astrocytes]], [[macrophages|macrophages]] and [[neurons|neurons]].<ref name=Eckhardt/><ref name=Xiao/>  Elevated levels of sulfatide have also been linked to [[epilepsy|epilepsy]] and audiogenic seizures (seizures induced by sound), while elevated levels of anti-sulfatide antibodies in the [[Serum_(blood)|serum]] have been associated with [[Multiple_Sclerosis|Multiple Sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's|Parkinson's]].<ref name=Xiao/>
-->
====鑑別髓鞘====
如上所述，腦硫脂主要在[[神经系统|神经系统]]中的[[少突神經膠質細胞|少突神經膠質細胞]]及[[施旺細胞|施旺細胞]]裡被發現。<!--When [[oligodendrocytes|oligodendrocytes]] are [[cellular_differentiation|differentiating]], sulfatide is first evident in immature [[oligodendrocytes|oligodendrocytes]].<ref name=Eckhardt/>  However, research suggests that sulfatide has a greater role than simply being a structural component of the membrane.<ref name=Eckhardt/> This is because sulfatide is [[upregulated|upregulated]], i.e.there is an increase in sulfatide, prior to the [[myelin_sheath|myelin sheath]] being wrapped around the [[axon|axon]], and experiments in cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) deficient mice have shown that sulfatide operates as a negative regulator (inhibitor) of [[oligodendrocyte|oligodendrocyte]] [[cellular_differentiation|differentiation]].<ref name=Eckhardt/> Accordingly, further research has demonstrated that when sulfatide is deficient, there is a two to threefold increase in [[oligodendrocyte|oligodendrocyte]] [[cellular_differentiation|differentiation]], evidence providing support that sulfatide operates as a negative regulator or inhibitor of [[oligodendrocyte|oligodendrocyte]] [[cellular_differentiation|differentiation]].<ref name=Eckhardt/>  [[Myelination|Myelination]] also appears to be stimulated by sulfatide in the [[Schwann_Cells|Schwann Cells]]. Such stimulation is thought to occur through the following interactions. First, sulfatide binds to [[tenascin-R|tenascin-R]] or [[laminin|laminin]] in the [[extracellular_matrix|extracellular matrix]], which goes on to bind signaling molecules such as F3 and [[integrins|integrins]] in the [[glial|glial]] membrane.<ref name=Eckhardt/> This causes signaling through [[C-src_tyrosine_kinase|c-src]]/[[fyn|fyn]] kinase. Specifically, the [[laminin|laminin]] α6β1-[[integrin|integrin]] forms a complex with [[fyn|fyn]] kinase and [[focal_adhesion_kinase|focal adhesion kinase]] that enables signaling, which, in turn, causes [[myelination|myelination]] to begin.<ref name=Eckhardt/> Sulfatide binding to [[laminin|laminin]] also causes [[C-src_tyrosine_kinase|c-src]]/[[fyn|fyn]] kinase activation and initiation of basement membrane formation.<ref name=Eckhardt/>
-->
====硫苷脂和髓鞘及淋巴細胞蛋白====
腦硫脂也與[[髓鞘及淋巴細胞蛋白|髓鞘及淋巴細胞蛋白]](MAL)有關。<!--Research has shown that [[MAL_(gene)|MAL]] may be involved in [[vesicular_transport|vesicular transport]] of sulfatide and other [[myelin|myelin]] [[proteins|proteins]] and [[lipids|lipids]] to the myelinating membrane.<ref name=Takahashi/>  [[MAL_(gene)|MAL]] is also believed to form membrane microdomains (small regions on the membrane with distinct structure and function) in which [[lipids|lipids]], such as sulfatide, are stabilized into [[lipid_rafts|lipid rafts]], allowing stabilization of the glial-axon junctions.<ref name=Eckhardt/>
-->
====神經膠質細胞軸突連接及信號====<!--
Sulfatide has also been shown to play a role in [[myelin|myelin]] maintenance and glial-axon signaling, which was indicated by research in older cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST)-deficient mice.<ref name=Takahashi/> These mice had [[vacuole|vacuolar]] degeneration, uncompacted myelin, and moderate [[demyelination|demyelination]] of the [[spinal_cord|spinal cord]].<ref name=Eckhardt/><ref name=Takahashi/> This occurs because improper glial-axon signaling and contact and disruption of paranodal glial-axon junctions causes improper placement and maintenance of  [[sodium|sodium]] and [[potassium|potassium]] channel clusters in the [[axons|axons]] at the [[nodes_of_Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]].<ref name=Takahashi/>  As a result, the maintenance of [[Nav1.6|Nav1.6]] sodium clusters is impaired as there is a decrease in the number of clusters of [[sodium_channels|sodium channels]] at the [[nodes_of_Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]].<ref name=Eckhardt/> Additionally, [[Kv1.2|Kv1.2]] channels are moved from the paranodal position to the juxtaparanodal position causing impairment of these channels; this is also associated with the loss of [[neurofascin|neurofascin]] 155 and [[Caspr|Caspr]] clusters, which are important components of the glial-axon junction.<ref name=Eckhardt/>
-->
腦硫脂對[[周围神经系统|周围神经系统]]的神經膠質[[轴突|轴突]]也是很重要的一種成分。<!--In [[peripheral_nerves|peripheral nerves]] that are cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) deficient, the [[nodes_of_Ranvier|nodes of Ranvier]] form enlarged axonal protrusions filled with enlarged [[Synaptic_vesicle|vesicles]], and [[neurofascin|neurofascin]] 155 and [[Caspr|Caspr]] clusters are diminished or absent.<ref name=Eckhardt/> In order to form a paranodal junction, [[Caspr|Caspr]] and [[contactin|contactin]] form a complex with [[neurofascin|neurofascin]] 155.<ref name=Eckhardt/> It has been shown that sulfatide may be involved in the recruitment and formation of [[neurofascin|neurofascin]] 155 in [[lipid_rafts|lipid rafts]]; [[neurofascin|neurofascin]] 155 protein clusters then bring [[Caspr|Caspr]] and [[contactin|contactin]] into the membrane to form the complex, which allows the formation of stable glial-axon junctions.<ref name=Eckhardt/> Consequently, sulfatide plays an important role in maintaining the paranodal glial-axon junctions, which allows for proper glial-axon interaction and signaling.<ref name=Eckhardt/><ref name=Takahashi/> Sulfatide has also been shown to be an inhibitor of [[myelin|myelin]] associated axon outgrowth, and small amounts of sulfatide have been found in [[astrocytes|astrocytes]] and [[neurons|neurons]], which is also indicative of its importance in glial-axon junctions.<ref name=Takahashi/>-->

====異常腦硫脂顯現====
腦硫脂的異常顯現與一些[[神經系統疾病|神經系統疾病]](neurological disorder)有所關聯。<!--As stated before, one of the major [[neurological_disorders|neurological disorders]] is [[Metachromatic_Leukodystrophy|Metachromatic Leukodystrophy]], which is caused by elevated levels of sulfatide, leading to the progressive loss of [[myelin|myelin]] as a result of sulfatide accumulation.<ref name= Xiao/><ref name=Takahashi/> High levels of sulfatide in the [[gray_matter|gray matter]] in the [[cerebellum|cerebellum]] and in the superior [[frontal_lobe|frontal lobe]] have been associated with [[Parkinson's_disease|Parkinson's disease]].<ref name= Xiao/> Additionally, accumulation of sulfatide in neurons causes [[audiogenic|audiogenic]] [[seizures|seizures]], which have been shown to be lethal in [[model_organisms|mouse models]].<ref name= Xiao/> On the other hand, reduced levels of sulfatide in the [[cerebrum|cerebral]] gray and [[white_matter|white matter]] have been associated with [[Alzheimer's_disease|Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name= Xiao/><ref name= Hanx/>-->

In the diagnosis of [[type_I_diabetes|type I diabetes]], elevated anti-sulfatide antibodies in [[serum_(blood)|serum]] arise. Such anti-sulfatide antibodies prevent [[insulin|insulin]] [[secretion|secretion]] and [[exocytosis|exocytosis]].<ref name=Takahashi/> However, research has shown that when non-obese diabetic mice are treated with sulfatide, it reduces the possible occurrence of diabetes from 85% in control animals to 35% in experimental animals.<ref name=Takahashi/> Sulfatide is also commonly known to possess [[anti-inflammatory|anti-inflammatory]] properties. As a result of these anti-inflammatory properties, which aid in the blockage of [[L-selectin|L-selectin]], sulfatide has been shown to prevent [[type_I_diabetes|type I diabetes]] and inhibit [[insulitis|insulitis]] in non-obese diabetic mice.<ref name=Takahashi/> Sulfatide also prevents [[apoptosis|apoptosis]] in insulin secreting cells by preventing the effects of [[interleukin-1_beta|interleukin-1 beta]] (lL-1β), [[interferon_beta_1b|interferon beta 1b]] (lFN-1β), and [[tumor_necrosis_factor_alpha|tumor necrosis factor alpha]] (TNF-α) that promote [[apoptosis|apoptosis]].<ref name=Takahashi/>

===癌症和腫瘤===<!--
Elevated sulfatide is common in many tissues in the human body including numerous [[cancer|cancer]] tissues and cells.<ref name=Xiao/><ref name=Takahashi/> These include:
[[File:Lung_adenocarcinoma_-_TTF-1_-_highmag.jpg|thumb]]]]-->
*原發性[[大腸癌|大腸癌]]組織。
*原發性[[肺腺癌|肺腺癌]]組織。
*惡性及良性[[卵巢癌|卵巢癌]]組織。
*[[腎癌|腎癌]]組織。
*漿液性乳頭狀卵巢癌組織。
*[[胃癌|胃癌]]組織。
*腎癌（SMKT-R3細胞系）。
<!--
Sulfatide levels in these cancer lines and tissues may vary. For example, the levels of sulfatide are much lower in undifferentiated small cell [[carcinoma|carcinoma]] tissues and primary lung [[squamous_cell_carcinoma|squamous cell carcinoma]] tissues in humans than in primary lung [[adenocarcinoma|adenocarcinoma]] tissue in humans.<ref name=Takahashi/>  In human [[ovarian_cancer|ovarian cancer]]s, sulfatide levels are much higher in [[malignant|malignant]] [[ovarian_cancer|ovarian cancer]]s than in [[benign|benign]] [[ovarian_cancer|ovarian cancer]]s.<ref name=Xiao/><ref name=Takahashi/> Other cancers such as [[Wilms’_tumor|Wilms’ tumor]] show no expression of sulfatide. Therefore, it appears that such increased levels of sulfatide are not universal in every form of cancer, and more experimentation must be done to confirm that elevated levels of sulfatide are not just [[artifact_(error)|artifacts]] of cultured cancer cell lines.<ref name=Takahashi/>
[[File:Pselectin.PNG|thumb]]]]
However, experimentation using [[renal_cancer|renal cancer]] cell lines has given some insight into the mechanism for the elevated levels of sulfatide expression in cancer cells.<ref name=Takahashi/> Specifically, cerebroside sulfotransferase (CST) is elevated as it passes along a [[signaling_pathway|signaling pathway]] which involves:<ref name=Takahashi/>
*[[hepatocyte_growth_factor|hepatocyte growth factor]]

*[[tyrosine_kinases|tyrosine kinases]]
*[[TNF-α|TNF-α]]
*[[protein_kinase_C|protein kinase C]]
*[[Ras|Ras]]

This path results in the accumulation of sulfatide in [[renal_cancer|renal cancer]] cell lines.<ref name=Takahashi/> Additionally, sulfatide can accumulate on the surface of cancer cells. This indicates that sulfatide may serve as a specific [[ligand|ligand]] for [[P-selectin|P-selectin]]. This would contribute to increased [[metastasis|metastasis]] of the cancer.<ref name=Takahashi/> However, more research is needed to elucidate the relationship between the elevated levels of sulfatide expression and the initiation and [[metastasis|metastasis]] mechanisms of cancer,<ref name=Takahashi/> but sulfatide may be a useful [[serum_(blood)|serum]] [[biomarker|biomarker]] for early tumor detection.<ref name=Xiao/>-->

===病毒感染===<!--
Experimentation with sulfatide has shown that it has involvement in several viral infections including [[HIV-1|HIV-1]], [[Influenza_A_virus|Influenza A virus]], [[Hepatitis_C|Hepatitis C]], and the [[Vaccinia_virus|Vaccinia virus]].-->

====HIV-1====
[[File:PDB_1b03_EBI.jpg|thumb]] fragment of the [[HIV-1|HIV-1]] envelope [[gp120|gp120]] complex]]

磺胺類藥物顯示涉及[[HIV亚型|HIV亚型]]的感染。<ref name=Xiao/><!--[[gp120|gp120]]-[[gp41|gp41]] are specific types of envelope [[glycoprotein|glycoprotein]] complexes that are found on HIV-1.<ref name=Takahashi/> These glycoprotein complexes can interact with [[CD4|CD4]], a viral receptor molecule, which induces a change in the conformation of [[gp120|gp120]]. This change in conformation allows the [[gp120|gp120]] complex to interact with the [[chemokine|chemokine]] co-receptor and the insertion of the fusion peptide,[[gp41|gp41]], into the membrane of the host cell.<ref name=Takahashi/> This allows the HIV-1 virus to enter into the cell.<ref name=Takahashi/> [[Gp120|Gp120]] can also bind to [[glycolipids|glycolipids]] like sulfatide and galactocerebroside (GalCer). Sulfatide binds strongly to the [[V3_loop|V3 loop]] of [[gp120|gp120]], which does not interact with [[CD4|CD4]].<ref name=Takahashi/> Consequently, sulfatide acts as an alternate virus receptor in CD4- cells, and it participates in transmembrane signaling. However, sulfatide has little function in HIV-1 infection of CD4+ cells.<ref name=Takahashi/>

The binding of [[gp120|gp120]] to GalCer has the ability to start the fusion of HIV-1, but the binding of [[gp120|gp120]] to sulfatide does not.<ref name=Takahashi/> Sulfatide is not a functional receptor. However, experiments have shown that sulfatide and GalCer compete for the ability to bind to gp120, and sulfatide has been shown to have the strongest [[binding_affinity|binding affinity]] for recombinant [[gp120|gp120]] of all the glycolipids tested.<ref name=Takahashi/>  Therefore, this suggests that when sulfatide is attached to HIV-1, it cannot interact with the [[chemokine|chemokine]] co-receptor because of the instability of the complex between [[gp120|gp120]] and sulfatide, which therefore prevents the initiation of the fusion process.<ref name=Takahashi/> This indicates that sulfatide can prevent [[HIV-1|HIV-1]] infection by mediating [[gp120|gp120]] binding, which, in turn, prevents the fusion process; consequently, it has been demonstrated that sulfatide treatments may lead to the inhibition of HIV-1 replication.<ref name=Takahashi/>

Additionally,[[HIV-1|HIV-1]] infected patients often suffer from myelin degeneration in the [[central_nervous_system|central nervous system]]. These patients have elevated levels of sulfatide in the [[cerebrospinal_fluid|cerebrospinal fluid]] (CSF) and anti-sulfatide antibodies in the [[serum_(blood)|serum]].<ref name=Takahashi/> Elevated levels of anti-sulfatide antibodies can cause [[demyelination|demyelination]]. This is caused by the binding of the anti-sulfatide antibodies to the surface of the [[myelin_sheath|myelin sheath]] and/or the surface of [[Schwann_Cells|Schwann Cells]], which then activates a complete cascade of demyelination.<ref name=Takahashi/> Also, advanced stage [[AIDS|AIDS]] patients can develop [[Guillain-Barré_syndrome|Guillain-Barré syndrome]] (GBS). [[Guillain-Barré_syndrome|Guillain-Barré syndrome]] is classified as an acute [[autoimmune|autoimmune]] [[polyneuropathy|polyneuropathy]], which specifically affects the [[peripheral_nervous_system|peripheral nervous system]] of the infected patient.<ref name=Takahashi/> Experimentation has shown that anti-sulfatide autoimmune antibodies may contribute to the development of [[Guillain-Barré_syndrome|Guillain-Barré syndrome]] in [[AIDS|AIDS]] patients as well as the development of [[peripheral_nervous_system|peripheral nervous system]] injury in [[HIV-1|HIV-1]] infected patients.<ref name=Takahashi/>-->

Nevertheless, [[sphingolipid|sphingolipid]] synthesis in the host, has been demonstrated to be necessary for HCV [[self-replication|replication]] , which indicates that sulfatide may be involved in the [[self-replication|replication]] of HCV.<ref name=Takahashi/>-->

However, this is only under acidic conditions not neutral conditions.<ref name=Takahashi/> To fully understand the role of sulfatide in the cycle of [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] infection, research have expressed sulfatide in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, which can express sulfatide and support [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] [[self-replication|replication]] and in [[COS|COS]]-7 cells, which do not have the ability to express sulfatide and do not support [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] [[self-replication|replication]] sufficiently. Consequently,the [[COS|COS]]-7 cells were [[transfected|transfected]] with galactosyltransferase and cerebroside sulfotransferase genes from the Madin-Darby canine kidney cells and used to make two cell clones with the ability to express sulfatide .<ref name=Takahashi/>

These cells were then infected with the [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] virus, and research has shown that the sulfatide enhanced cells infected with [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] show increased [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] [[self-replication|replication]] in the progeny virus, 500-3,000 times the parent virus. However, the sulfatide enriched cells also have a small reduction in initial infection compared to the parent cells.<ref name=Xiao/><ref name=Takahashi/> The opposite is shown in sulfatide [[gene_knockdown|knockdown]] Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, exhibiting a reduction in progeny virus concentration vs. parent virus concentration and an increase in initial infection. Overall, such experiments demonstrate that sulfide rich cells enhance [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] [[Self-replication|replication]] and that sulfatide on the cell’s surface may play a role in the [[self-replication|replication]] of [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]].<ref name=Xiao/><ref name=Takahashi/>

Further experimentation has demonstrated that sulfatide enriched cells, in which sulfatide binds to [[hemagglutinin|hemagglutinin]], enhances [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] [[self-replication|replication]] by increasing the progeny virus particle formation; this is done through the promotion of nuclear export of [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] formed viral [[ribonucleoprotein|ribonucleoprotein]]s from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.<ref name=Takahashi/> Experimentation has also demonstrated that if binding is inhibited between sulfatide and [[hemagglutinin|hemagglutinin]] that viral particle formation and replication would be inhibited, again suggesting that the binding between sulfatide and [[hemagglutinin|hemagglutinin]] facilitates [[Influenza_A_virus|IAV]] [[self-replication|replication]].<ref name=Takahashi/>-->

====牛痘病毒====

Sulfatide may also play a role in [[Mycobacterium_tuberculosis|Mycobacterium tuberculosis]], which is the agent that causes [[tuberculosis|tuberculosis]] in humans.

腦硫脂還涉入[[乙型澱粉樣蛋白|乙型澱粉樣蛋白]](Amyloid beta)肽的清除。乙型澱粉樣蛋白肽是[[阿兹海默病|阿兹海默病]]的標誌之一。當它們沒有適當的降低，這些肽積聚並產生斑塊，這些斑塊是乙型澱粉樣蛋白肽片的團塊，而且和[[阿兹海默病|阿兹海默病]]有相當的關聯。<ref name=Hanx/>乙型澱粉樣蛋白肽的清除是很重要的，最好要讓這種斑塊的積累現象不要出現。<ref name=Hanx/>經由[[內吞作用|內吞]]的途徑，腦硫脂可促進乙型澱粉樣蛋白肽的去除。因此，當有高含量的腦硫脂時，則就有較低量的乙型澱粉樣蛋白肽。<ref name=Hanx/>因為[[阿兹海默病|阿兹海默氏疾病]]的受試者具有較低腦硫脂水平，故而乙型澱粉樣蛋白肽的清除率較低，這使得肽在大腦裡積聚並產生斑塊。<ref name=Hanx/>
