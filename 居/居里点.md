'''居里点'''（Curie point）又作'''居里温度'''（Curie temperature，'''Tc'''）或'''磁性转变点'''。是指磁性材料中[[磁化強度|自发磁化强度]]降到零时的温度，是[[铁磁性|铁磁性]]或[[亚铁磁性|亚铁磁性]]物质转变成[[顺磁性|顺磁性]]物质的临界点。低于居里点温度时该物质成为[[铁磁体|铁磁体]]，此时和材料有关的[[磁场|磁场]]很难改变。当温度高于居里点时，该物质成为[[顺磁体|顺磁体]]，磁体的磁场很容易随周围磁场的改变而改变。这时的[[磁敏感度|磁敏感度]]约为10<sup>-6</sup>。居里点由物质的化学成分和[[晶体结构|晶体结构]]决定。

居禮點的溫度可以用平均場理論估計。

== 磁矩 ==
磁矩是原子内的永久[[偶极矩|偶极矩]]，包含电子的角动量和自旋<ref name=Hall>{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|p=200}}</ref>，他们之间的关系是 μ<sub>l</sub> = el/2m<sub>e</sub>, m<sub>e</sub> 是电子质量, μ<sub>l</sub> 是磁矩, l是角动量; 这个比例被称作 '''gyromagnetic ratio'''（[[旋磁比|旋磁比]]）.

原子中的电子从它们自己的[[角动量|角动量]]和它们围绕原子核的轨道动量贡献[[磁矩|磁矩]]。与来自电子的磁矩相比，来自原子核的磁矩是微不足道的。<ref name=Jullien136>{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|pp=136–38}}</ref> 热作用在更高能量的电子上结果就是扰乱了秩序，并破坏了偶极子之间的对齐。 



[[铁磁性|铁磁性]], [[顺磁性|顺磁性]], [[亚铁磁性|亚铁磁性]]和[[反铁磁性|反铁磁性]]材料有不同的固有磁矩结构。在材料特定的居里温度下，这些属性会发生变化。从反铁磁性到顺磁性（或反之亦然）的过渡发生在[[奈尔温度|奈尔温度]], 这与居里温度类似。

===顺磁性===
{{main|顺磁性}}

A material is paramagnetic only above its Curie temperature. Paramagnetic materials are non-magnetic when a [[磁场|磁场]] is absent and magnetic when a magnetic field is applied. When a magnetic field is absent, the material has disordered magnetic moments; that is, the atoms are asymmetrical and not aligned. When a magnetic field is present, the magnetic moments are temporarily realigned parallel to the applied field;<ref name=Dekker1>{{harvnb|Dekker|1958|pp=217–20}}</ref><ref name=Levy4>{{harvnb|Levy|1968|pp=}}</ref> the atoms are symmetrical and aligned.<ref name=Fan>{{harvnb|Fan|1987|pp=164–65}}</ref> The magnetic moments being aligned in the same direction are what causes an induced magnetic field.<ref name=Fan/><ref name=Dekker>{{harvnb|Dekker|1958|pp=454–55}}</ref>

For paramagnetism, this response to an applied magnetic field is positive and is known as [[magnetic_susceptibility|magnetic susceptibility]].<ref name=Ibach>{{harvnb|Ibach|Lüth|2009}}</ref> The magnetic susceptibility only applies above the Curie temperature for disordered states.<ref name=Mendelssohn3>{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|1977|p=162}}</ref>

Sources of paramagnetism (materials which have Curie temperatures) include:<ref name=Levy1>{{harvnb|Levy|1968|pp=198–202}}</ref>
* All atoms that have unpaired electrons;
* Atoms that have inner shells that are incomplete in electrons;
* [[Free_radicals|Free radicals]];
* Metals.

Above the Curie temperature, the atoms are excited, and the spin orientations become randomized<ref name=Levy/> but can be realigned by an applied field, i.e., the material becomes paramagnetic. Below the Curie temperature, the intrinsic structure has undergone a [[phase_transition|phase transition]],<ref name=Cusack>{{harvnb|Cusack|1958|p=269}}</ref> the atoms are ordered and the material is ferromagnetic.<ref name=Fan/> The paramagnetic materials' induced magnetic fields are very weak compared with ferromagnetic materials' magnetic fields.<ref name=Cusack/>

===铁磁性===
{{main|铁磁性}}

Materials are only ferromagnetic below their corresponding Curie temperatures. Ferromagnetic materials are magnetic in the absence of an applied magnetic field.

When a magnetic field is absent the material has [[spontaneous_magnetization|spontaneous magnetization]] which is a result of the ordered magnetic moments; that is, for ferromagnetism, the atoms are symmetrical and aligned in the same direction creating a permanent magnetic field.

The magnetic interactions are held together by [[exchange_interactions|exchange interactions]]; otherwise thermal disorder would overcome the weak interactions of magnetic moments. The exchange interaction has a zero probability of parallel electrons occupying the same point in time, implying a preferred parallel alignment in the material.<ref name=Hall1>{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|pp=220–21}}</ref> The Boltzmann factor contributes heavily as it prefers interacting particles to be aligned in the same direction.<ref name=Palmer>{{harvnb|Palmer|2007|pp=}}</ref> This causes [[ferromagnets|ferromagnets]] to have strong magnetic fields and high Curie temperatures of around {{convert|1000|K|C}}.<ref name=Hall3>{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|p=220}}</ref>

Below the Curie temperature, the atoms are aligned and parallel, causing spontaneous magnetism; the material is ferromagnetic. Above the Curie temperature the material is paramagnetic, as the atoms lose their ordered magnetic moments when the material undergoes a phase transition.<ref name=Cusack/>

===亚铁磁性===
{{main|亚铁磁性}}

Materials are only ferrimagnetic below their corresponding Curie temperature. Ferrimagnetic materials are magnetic in the absence of an applied magnetic field and are made up of two different [[离子|离子]].<ref name=Jullien158/>

When a magnetic field is absent the material has a spontaneous magnetism which is the result of ordered magnetic moments; that is, for ferrimagnetism one ion's magnetic moments are aligned facing in one direction with certain magnitude and the other ion's magnetic moments are aligned facing in the opposite direction with a different magnitude. As the magnetic moments are of different magnitudes in opposite directions there is still a spontaneous magnetism and a magnetic field is present.<ref name=Jullien158>{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|pp=158–59}}</ref>

Similar to ferromagnetic materials the magnetic interactions are held together by exchange interactions. The orientations of moments however are anti-parallel which results in a net momentum by subtracting their momentum from one another.<ref name=Jullien158/>

Below the Curie temperature the atoms of each ion are aligned anti-parallel with different momentums causing a spontaneous magnetism; the material is ferrimagnetic. Above the Curie temperature the material is paramagnetic as the atoms lose their ordered magnetic moments as the material undergoes a phase transition.<ref name=Jullien158/>

===反铁磁性与奈尔温度===
{{main|反铁磁性}}

Materials are only antiferromagetic below their corresponding [[奈尔温度|奈尔温度]]. This is similar to the Curie temperature as above the Néel Temperature the material undergoes a [[相变|相变]] and becomes paramagnetic.

The material has equal magnetic moments aligned in opposite directions resulting in a zero magnetic moment and a net magnetism of zero at all temperatures below the Néel temperature. Antiferromagnetic materials are weakly magnetic in the absence or presence of an applied magnetic field.

Similar to ferromagnetic materials the magnetic interactions are held together by exchange interactions preventing thermal disorder from overcoming the weak interactions of magnetic moments.<ref name=Hall1/><ref name=Jullien10/> When disorder occurs it is at the Néel temperature.<ref name=Jullien10>{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|pp=156–57}}</ref>

==居里 - 韦斯定律==
{{main|居里-韦斯定律}}
The Curie–Weiss law is an adapted version of [[居里定律|居里定律]].

The Curie–Weiss law is a simple model derived from a [[mean_field_theory|mean-field]] approximation, this means it works well for the materials temperature, {{mvar|T}}, much greater than their corresponding Curie temperature, {{math|''T''<sub>C</sub>}}, i.e. {{math|''T'' ≫ ''T''<sub>C</sub>}}; however fails to describe the [[magnetic_susceptibility|magnetic susceptibility]], {{mvar|χ}}, in the immediate vicinity of the Curie point because of local fluctuations between atoms.<ref name=Jullien153>{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|pp=153}}</ref>

Neither Curie's law nor the Curie–Weiss law holds for {{math|''T'' < ''T''<sub>C</sub>}}.

==物理==

===从上方接近居里温度===

As the Curie–Weiss law is an approximation, a more accurate model is needed when the temperature, {{mvar|T}}, approaches the material's Curie temperature, {{math|''T''<sub>C</sub>}}.

Magnetic susceptibility occurs above the Curie temperature.

An accurate model of critical behaviour for magnetic susceptibility with [[critical_exponent|critical exponent]] {{mvar|γ}}:

:<math>\chi \sim \frac{1}{(T - T_\mathrm{C})^\gamma}</math>

The critical exponent differs between materials and for the [[mean_field_theory|mean-field]] model is taken as {{mvar|γ}} = 1.<ref name=Hall227>{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|pp=227–28}}</ref>

As temperature is inversely proportional to magnetic susceptibility, when {{mvar|T}} approaches {{math|''T''<sub>C</sub>}} the denominator tends to zero and the magnetic susceptibility approaches [[infinity|infinity]] allowing magnetism to occur. This is a spontaneous magnetism which is a property of ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials.<ref name=Kittel>{{harvnb|Kittel|1986|pp=424–26}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Spaldin|2010|pp=52–54}}</ref>

===从下方接近居里温度===

Magnetism depends on temperature and spontaneous magnetism occurs below the Curie temperature. An accurate model of critical behaviour for spontaneous magnetism with critical exponent {{mvar|β}}:

:<math>M \sim (T - T_\mathrm{C})^\beta</math>

The critical exponent differs between materials and for the mean-field model as taken as {{mvar|β}} = {{sfrac|1|2}} where {{math|''T'' ≪  ''T''<sub>C</sub>}}.<ref name=Hall227/>

The spontaneous magnetism approaches zero as the temperature increases towards the materials Curie temperature.

===接近绝对零度（0开尔文）===

The spontaneous magnetism, occurring in ferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials, approaches zero as the temperature increases towards the material's Curie temperature. Spontaneous magnetism is at its maximum as the temperature approaches 0 K.<ref name=Hall4>{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|p=225}}</ref> That is, the magnetic moments are completely aligned and at their strongest magnitude of magnetism due to no thermal disturbance.

In paramagnetic materials temperature is sufficient to overcome the ordered alignments. As the temperature approaches 0 K, the [[熵|熵]] decreases to zero, that is, the disorder decreases and becomes ordered. This occurs without the presence of an applied magnetic field and obeys the [[热力学第三定律|热力学第三定律]].<ref name=Hall1/>

Both Curie's law and the Curie–Weiss law fail as the temperature approaches 0 K. This is because they depend on the magnetic susceptibility which only applies when the state is disordered.<ref name=Mendelssohn1>{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|1977|pp=180–81}}</ref>

[[硫酸钆|硫酸钆]] continues to satisfy Curie's law at 1 K. Between 0 and 1 K the law fails to hold and a sudden change in the intrinsic structure occurs at the Curie temperature.<ref name=Mendelssohn2>{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|1977|p=167}}</ref>

===Ising相变模型===

The [[Ising_model|Ising model]] is mathematically based and can analyse the critical points of [[phase_transitions|phase transitions]] in ferromagnetic order due to spins of electrons having magnitudes of ±{{sfrac|1|2}}. The spins interact with their neighbouring [[dipole|dipole]] electrons in the structure and here the Ising model can predict their behaviour with each other.<ref name=Bertoldi>{{harvnb|Bertoldi|Bringa|Miranda|2012}}</ref><ref name=Brout>{{harvnb|Brout|1965|pp=6–7}}</ref>

This model is important for solving and understanding the concepts of phase transitions and hence solving the Curie temperature. As a result, many different dependencies that affect the Curie temperature can be analysed.

For example, the surface and bulk properties depend on the alignment and magnitude of spins and the Ising model can determine the effects of magnetism in this system.

===Weiss磁畴和表面和体积居里温度===

<!-- 檔案不存在 [[File:Weiss_domains_in_a_ferromagnetic_material.png|thumb]] ，可從英文維基百科取得 -->
Materials structures consist of intrinsic magnetic moments which are separated into domains called [[Weiss_domains|Weiss domains]].<ref name=Jullien160>{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|p=161}}</ref> This can result in ferromagnetic materials having no spontaneous magnetism as domains could potentially balance each other out.<ref name=Jullien160/> The position of particles can therefore have different orientations around the surface than the main part (bulk) of the material. This property directly affects the Curie temperature as there can be a bulk Curie temperature {{math|''T''<sub>B</sub>}} and a different surface Curie temperature {{math|''T''<sub>S</sub>}} for a material.<ref name=Rau>{{harvnb|Rau|Jin|Robert|1988|pp=}}</ref>

This allows for the surface Curie temperature to be ferromagnetic above the bulk Curie temperature when the main state is disordered, i.e. Ordered and disordered states occur simultaneously.<ref name=Bertoldi/>

The surface and bulk properties can be predicted by the Ising model and electron capture spectroscopy can be used to detect the electron spins and hence the [[magnetic_moments|magnetic moments]] on the surface of the material. An average total magnetism is taken from the bulk and surface temperatures to calculate the Curie temperature from the material, noting the bulk contributes more.<ref name=Bertoldi/><ref name=Skomski>{{harvnb|Skomski|Sellmyer|2000|pp=}}</ref>

The [[angular_momentum|angular momentum]] of an electron is either +{{sfrac|{{mvar|ħ}}|2}} or −{{sfrac|{{mvar|ħ}}|2}} due to it having a spin of {{sfrac|1|2}}, which gives a specific size of magnetic moment to the electron; the [[Bohr_magneton|Bohr magneton]].<ref name=Jullien138>{{harvnb|Jullien|Guinier|1989|p=138}}</ref> Electrons orbiting around the nucleus in a current loop create a magnetic field which depends on the Bohr Magneton and [[magnetic_quantum_number|magnetic quantum number]].<ref name=Jullien138/> Therefore, the magnetic moments are related between angular and orbital momentum and affect each other. Angular momentum contributes twice as much to magnetic moments than orbital.<ref name=Hall1994>{{harvnb|Hall|Hook|1994|pp=}}</ref>

For [[terbium|terbium]] which is a [[rare-earth_metal|rare-earth metal]] and has a high orbital angular momentum the magnetic moment is strong enough to affect the order above its bulk temperatures. It is said to have a high [[anisotropy|anisotropy]] on the surface, that is it is highly directed in one orientation. It remains ferromagnetic on its surface above its Curie temperature while its bulk becomes ferrimagnetic and then at higher temperatures its surface remains ferrimagnetic above its bulk Néel Temperature before becoming completely disordered and paramagnetic with increasing temperature. The anisotropy in the bulk is different from its surface anisotropy just above these phase changes as the magnetic moments will be ordered differently or ordered in paramagnetic materials.<ref name=Rau/>

===更改材料的居里温度===

==== Composite materials ====

[[Composite_materials|Composite materials]], that is, materials composed from other materials with different properties, can change the Curie temperature. For example, a composite which has [[silver|silver]] in it can create spaces for oxygen molecules in bonding which decreases the Curie temperature<ref name=Hwang>{{harvnb|Hwang et al.|1998|pp=}}</ref> as the crystal lattice will not be as compact.

The alignment of magnetic moments in the composite material affects the Curie temperature. If the materials moments are parallel with each other the Curie temperature will increase and if perpendicular the Curie temperature will decrease<ref name=Hwang/> as either more or less thermal energy will be needed to destroy the alignments.

Preparing composite materials through different temperatures can result in different final compositions which will have different Curie temperatures.<ref name=Paulsen>{{harvnb|Paulsen et al.|2003|pp=}}</ref> [[Doping_(semiconductor)|Doping]] a material can also affect its Curie temperature.<ref name=Paulsen/>

The density of nanocomposite materials changes the Curie temperature. [[Nanocomposites|Nanocomposites]] are compact structures on a nano-scale. The structure is built up of high and low bulk Curie temperatures, however will only have one mean-field Curie temperature. A higher density of lower bulk temperatures results in a lower mean-field Curie temperature and a higher density of higher bulk temperature significantly increases the mean-field Curie temperature. In more than one dimension the Curie temperature begins to increase as the magnetic moments will need more thermal energy to overcome the ordered structure.<ref name=Skomski/>

==== Particle size ====

The size of particles in a material's crystal lattice changes the Curie temperature. Due to the small size of particles (nanoparticles) the fluctuations of electron spins become more prominent, this results in the Curie temperature drastically decreasing when the size of particles decrease as the fluctuations cause disorder. The size of a particle also affects the [[anisotropy|anisotropy]] causing alignment to become less stable and thus lead to disorder in magnetic moments.<ref name=Bertoldi/><ref name=Lopez-Dominguez>{{harvnb|López Domínguez et al.|2013|pp=}}</ref>

The extreme of this is [[superparamagnetism|superparamagnetism]] which only occurs in small ferromagnetic particles and is where fluctuations are very influential causing magnetic moments to change direction randomly and thus create disorder.

The Curie temperature of nanoparticles are also affected by the [[crystal_lattice|crystal lattice]] structure, [[body-centred_cubic|body-centred cubic]] (bcc), [[face-centred_cubic|face-centred cubic]] (fcc) and a [[hexagonal|hexagonal]] structure (hcp) all have different Curie temperatures due to magnetic moments reacting to their neighbouring electron spins. fcc and hcp have tighter structures and as a results have higher Curie temperatures than bcc as the magnetic moments have stronger effects when closer together.<ref name=Bertoldi/> This is known as the [[coordination_number|coordination number]] which is the number of nearest neighbouring particles in a structure. This indicates a lower coordination number at the surface of a material than the bulk which leads to the surface becoming less significant when the temperature is approaching the Curie temperature. In smaller systems the coordination number for the surface is more significant and the magnetic moments have a stronger affect on the system.<ref name=Bertoldi/>

Although fluctuations in particles can be minuscule, they are heavily dependent on the structure of crystal lattices as they react with their nearest neighbouring particles. Fluctuations are also affected by the exchange interaction<ref name=Lopez-Dominguez/> as parallel facing magnetic moments are favoured and therefore have less disturbance and disorder, therefore a tighter structure influences a stronger magnetism and therefore a higher Curie temperature.

==== Pressure ====

Pressure changes a material's Curie temperature. Increasing [[pressure|pressure]] on the [[crystal_lattice|crystal lattice]] decreases the volume of the system. Pressure directly affects the [[kinetic_energy|kinetic energy]] in particles as movement increases causing the vibrations to disrupt the order of magnetic moments. This is similar to temperature as it also increases the kinetic energy of particles and destroys the order of magnetic moments and magnetism.<ref name=Bose>{{harvnb|Bose et al.|2011|pp=}}</ref>

Pressure also affects the [[density_of_states|density of states]] (DOS).<ref name=Bose/> Here the DOS decreases causing the number of electrons available to the system to decrease. This leads to the number of magnetic moments decreasing as they depend on electron spins. It would be expected because of this that the Curie temperature would decrease however it increases. This is the result of the [[exchange_interaction|exchange interaction]]. The exchange interaction favours the aligned parallel magnetic moments due to electrons being unable to occupy the same space in time<ref name=Hall1/> and as this is increased due to the volume decreasing the Curie temperature increases with pressure. The Curie temperature is made up of a combination of dependencies on kinetic energy and the DOS.<ref name=Bose/>

The concentration of particles also affects the Curie temperature when pressure is being applied and can result in a decrease in Curie temperature when the concentration is above a certain percent.<ref name=Bose/>

==== Orbital ordering ====

[[Atomic_orbital|Orbital ordering]] changes the Curie temperature of a material. Orbital ordering can be controlled through applied [[Deformation_(mechanics)|strains]].<ref name=Sadoc>{{harvnb|Sadoc et al.|2010|pp=}}</ref> This is a function that determines the wave of a single electron or paired electrons inside the material. Having control over the [[probability|probability]] of where the electron will be allows the Curie temperature to be altered. For example, the [[delocalised|delocalised]] electrons can be moved onto the same [[lattice_plane|plane]] by applied strains within the crystal lattice.<ref name=Sadoc/>

The Curie temperature is seen to increase greatly due to electrons being packed together in the same plane, they are forced to align due to the [[exchange_interaction|exchange interaction]] and thus increases the strength of the magnetic moments which prevents thermal disorder at lower temperatures.

== 铁电材料中的居里温度 ==

In analogy to ferromagnetic and paramagnetic materials, the term Curie temperature ({{math|''T''<sub>C</sub>}}) is also applied to the temperature at which a [[ferroelectric|ferroelectric]] material transitions to being [[paraelectric|paraelectric]]. Hence, {{math|''T''<sub>C</sub>}} is the temperature where ferroelectric materials lose their spontaneous polarisation as a first or second order phase change occurs. In case of a second order transition the Curie Weiss temperature {{math|''T''<sub>0</sub>}} which defines the maximum of the dielectric constant is equal to the Curie temperature. However, the Curie temperature can be 10 K higher than {{math|''T''<sub>0</sub>}} in case of a first order transition.<ref name=Webster>{{harvnb|Webster|1999|pp=}}</ref>

=== Ferroelectric and dielectric ===

Materials are only ferroelectric below their corresponding transition temperature {{math|''T''<sub>0</sub>}}.<ref name=Myers404>{{harvnb|Myers|1997|pp=404–05}}</ref> Ferroelectric materials are all [[pyroelectric|pyroelectric]] and therefore have a spontaneous electric polarisation as the structures are unsymmetrical.

Ferroelectric materials' polarization is subject to [[hysteresis|hysteresis]] (Figure 4); that is they are dependent on their past state as well as their current state. As an electric field is applied the dipoles are forced to align and polarisation is created, when the electric field is removed polarisation remains. The hysteresis loop depends on temperature and as a result as the temperature is increased and reaches {{math|''T''<sub>0</sub>}} the two curves become one curve as shown in the dielectric polarisation (Figure 5).<ref name=Pascoe1>{{harvnb|Pascoe|1973|pp=190–91}}</ref>

A heat-induced ferromagnetic-paramagnetic transition is used in [[magneto-optical|magneto-optical]] storage media, for erasing and writing of new data. Famous examples include the [[Sony|Sony]] [[Minidisc|Minidisc]] format, as well as the now-obsolete [[CD-RW#CD-MO|CD-MO]] format. Curie point electro-magnets have been proposed and tested for actuation mechanisms in passive safety systems of [[Breeder_reactor|fast breeder reactors]], where [[Control_rod|control rods]] are dropped into the reactor core if the actuation mechanism heats up beyond the material's curie point.<ref name="Takamatsu">{{cite journal |last1=Takamatsu |title=Demonstration of Control Rod Holding Stability of the Self Actuated Shutdown System in Joyo for Enhancement of Fast Reactor Inherent Safety |journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology |volume=44 |issue=3 |url=https://doi.org/10.1080/18811248.2007.9711316}}</ref> Other uses include temperature control in [[soldering_iron|soldering iron]]s,<ref>{{harvnb|TMT-9000S}}</ref> and stabilizing the magnetic field of [[tachometer|tachometer]] generators against temperature variation.<ref>{{harvnb|Pallàs-Areny|Webster|2001|pp=262–63}}</ref>
