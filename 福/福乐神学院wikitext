'''福乐神学院'''（{{lang-en|Fuller Theological Seminary}}）是位于美国加州[[帕萨迪纳|帕萨迪纳]]的一座福音派[[神学院|神学院]]，也是世界上最大的跨教派神学院。该校拥有4300名学生，来自70多个国家、120个[[教派|教派]]，以其严格的学术水平和种族、教派多样性著称。

福乐神学院拥有3个学院：[[神学|神学]]、[[心理学|心理学]]、[[跨文化研究|跨文化研究]]，以及从事终身学习的霍纳中心(Horner Center)。
福乐神学院既欢迎保守的福音派，也接纳自由派。学生和教授经常持有对立的观点，举行激烈的辩论<!-- issues, yet remain committed to their Christian camaraderie. Fuller's diverse student body and ecumenical persuasion are among its chief strengths. It is also frequently at the center of debate among religious and secular intellectuals on issues ranging from politics, religion, science and culture. Fuller is also the target of criticism in conservative evangelical circles for its allegedly liberal stance on 宗教和政治问题。 -->

==历史==
福乐神学院成立于1947年，<!-- [[Charles_E._Fuller|Charles E. Fuller]], a well-known [[radio|radio]] [[evangelist|evangelist]], [[Harold_Ockenga|Harold Ockenga]], [[pastor|pastor]] of Park Street Church in [[Boston,_Massachusetts|Boston]], [[Carl_F._H._Henry|Carl F. H. Henry]], [[Wilbur_Moorehead_Smith|Wilbur Moorehead Smith]] and [[Harold_Lindsell|Harold Lindsell]]. It began with the theological vision of reforming [[Fundamentalist_Christianity|fundamentalism]] from its anti-intellectual and socially isolationist stance of the 1920-40 era. The founders envisaged that the seminary would become the [[California_Institute_of_Technology|Caltech]] of Christian scholarship.

Some of the earliest faculty held to theologically and socially conservative views, which later gave way to more progressive thinking in the 1960s and 1970s. There were tensions in the late 1950s and early 1960s as some of the conservative faculty members—such as [[Carl_F._H._Henry|Carl F. H. Henry]], [[Harold_Lindsell|Harold Lindsell]], [[Wilbur_Moorehead_Smith|Wilbur Moorehead Smith]] and [[Gleason_Archer|Gleason Archer]]; became uncomfortable with staff and students who did not agree with total biblical [[inerrancy|inerrancy]]. These tensions are discussed at length in [[George_Marsden|George Marsden]]'s well-known historical account of the seminary and its place in the rise of [[neo-evangelicalism|neo-evangelicalism]]. Since the 1970s, Fuller has gone through significant transformation and is influential today as a progressive evangelical institution with strong commitment to scholarship and training of Christian leaders, as well as to social justice and mission. -->

==批评==
<!-- While Fuller was founded by conservative Christians in 1947 as an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] seminary whose mission was to reform Christian fundamentalism, some say that it is inaccurate to currently classify the seminary as evangelical. Indeed, while the school was founded as a conservative option to the liberal Princeton Seminary, it has moved closer to the liberal side of Christianity over the years. Fuller advertises itself as a moderate evangelical seminary, theologically between [[普林斯顿神学院|普林斯顿神学院]] (liberal) and [[达拉斯神学院|达拉斯神学院]] (conservative), but there has been some question within the larger [[Christian|Christian]] community as to whether Fuller truly does lie in the middle of the conservative/liberal theological divide. Currently, Fuller reports that faculty and students come from over 150 [[Christian|Christian]] denominations representing a wide variety of theological viewpoints<ref>http://www.fuller.edu/registrar/catalogs/2005-06/01_Introduction_To_Fuller/3_A_Christian_Community.asp</ref>.-->

起初福乐神学院在1947年成立時，被歸類為保守福音派，自1962年之後已經逐年朝向自由派發展，目前被視為介於{{le|普林斯顿神学院|Princeton Theological Seminary}} (自由派) 及[[达拉斯神学院|达拉斯神学院]] (保守派)之間的[[新正統神學|新正統派]]。
<!--Some argue that the "slide towards liberalism" began with the landmark 1962 decision to move away from the seminary's statement on the doctrine of Biblical inspiration and [[inerrancy|inerrancy]], in favor of a statement containing the less restrictive word "infallibility." This decision was so dramatic that immediately following it, many of the seminary's conservative faculty left the school. Many conservative evangelicals currently contend that the overall "flavour" of the school would be either liberal or on the theological left compared to most mainstream evangelical seminaries. -->

1962年底福乐神学院的「教授與董事聯合退修會」上，董事會認為不需堅持學校原先的保守信仰。1963年David Hubbard接任院長後，將神學院「信仰告白」中的「聖經無論整體或部分，都沒有任何錯誤」的宣言刪除。該院教授 Paul Jewett在其1975年出版的書 Man As Maleand Female裡公開表示，「使徒保羅論到妻子要順服丈夫時，保羅錯了」，引起軒然大波，學校因而成立特別委員會來處理此案，結論是：學校容許不同看法，不需採取任何懲戒行動。<ref name=refs>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crts.edu/Bulletin.2014.Spring.pdf |title=今日神學的危機 呂沛淵牧師, Spring 2014 改革宗神學宣教會 |access-date=2014-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106013521/http://crts.edu/Bulletin.2014.Spring.pdf |archive-date=2014-11-06 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>此即反應該院支持「聖經部分有誤」（在信仰與生活上無誤，在歷史與科學上有誤）立場之證明。

福乐神学院標榜學校師生由來自基督教150以上的宗派組成<ref>[http://stage.fuller.edu/printbloglistings.aspx?userid=2147483698 Diversity at Fuller]{{Dead link|date=2019年6月 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>，具有廣泛多樣性，涵蓋各式宗派觀點。根據1985年 George M. Marsden對福乐校友調查報告<ref>「富勒神學院校史」 Reforming Fundamentalism: Fuller Seminary and the New Evangelicalism，1987</ref>，1965至1967畢業的校友在畢業時相信「聖經完全無誤」的只有25%；相信「主耶穌基督是得救上天堂的唯一盼望」者只有47%。 James D. Hunter在1982年所作「福音派神學院研究」<ref>Evangelicalism:the Coming Generation，1987</ref>的調查資料顯示：福乐神學院當時在校學，只有15%相信聖經完全無誤。今日的福乐學院，已經為「中立開放派」的大本營。被部分相信「聖經完全無誤」的保守派神学院，視為神學信仰危機。<ref name=refs />
