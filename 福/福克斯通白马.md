|quote=At daybreak tomorrow a dozen Gurkha soldiers bearing limestone slabs will put the final touches on a giant white horse cut into a hill overlooking the English Channel...  As a result of a complaint by Friends of the Earth, the Government was asked by Brussels to explain the approval given in 2001 by Stephen Byers, who was then Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. If it fails to do so and the site cannot be restored, it may be liable for fines from the European Court of Justice...  The latest version was chosen by the local artist Charlie Newington because of a nearby [[Iron_Age|Iron Age]] fort in an area known three millennia ago as Horse Hill. The horse is at the centre of a rebranding exercise by the Shepway District Council. The logo is on council stationery and will soon be on all council vehicles
