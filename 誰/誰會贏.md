《'''誰會贏'''》（{{lang-en|'''Who Would Win'''}}）是《[[探險活寶|探險活寶]]》[[探險活寶_(第四季)|第四季]]第七集的名稱。在[[卡通頻道|卡通頻道]]2012年9月3日播出。本集以[[小男孩阿寶|小男孩阿寶]]和魔法狗[[酷狗老皮|老皮]]為主角。在這一集裡，芬蘭和老皮挑戰打名為白閃閃的怪物，但他們最終彼此戰鬥。最終，他們重圓他們的友誼並贏得戰鬥。

<!--==劇情==
While exploring a desert wasteland, Finn and Jake encounter a large creator that calls itself The Farm; it is challenging various contenders to best it in combat, but none are able to do so. Both Finn and Jake decide that they want to beat The Farm, so they start training. However, Jake loses interest quickly and reverts to playing ''Kompy's Kastle'', his favorite video game. This angers Finn so much that he breaks the game, which throws Jake into a fit of rage.

The two proceed to fight one another in an increasingly violent way, until both are unfit to fight The Farm; despite this, they both challenge the creature anyway, who promptly defeats them and knocks them unconscious. However, while knocked out, both Finn and Jake are visited by a mysterious Dream Warrior (voiced by [[Matthew_Broderick|Matthew Broderick]]), who gives them the advice that they need—albeit in the form riddles—to defeat The Farm; he tells them to use cheap fighting moves to obscure the creatures vision, pull down his pants, and bite his buttocks. Finn and Jake, working together, use the dream warriors techniques and are victorious.

"Who Would Win" was written and storyboarded by [[Ako_Castuera|Ako Castuera]] and [[Jesse_Moynihan|Jesse Moynihan]], from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]]. The episode was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Who Would Win| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Ako Castuera & Jesse Moynihan (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=September 3, 2012| season = 4 | number = 21}}</ref> A couple of the opening frames were storyboarded by [[Tom_Herpich|Tom Herpich]]; both Herpich and Moynihan had been at a comic book convention, and Herpich, who was bored, asked Moynihan if he could start the storyboard for "Who Would Win" as a way to pass the time.<ref name=tomwho>Herpich, Tom (Storyboard artist). 2014.

According to Moynihan, the episode revolves around several themes, such as whether Finn could hold his own against the seemingly unstoppable Jake in a fight, and the idea of [[willpower|willpower]] overcoming physical limitations. The dream sequence featuring the Dream Warrior was based on several spiritual ideas, such as dream journeying, and finding you [[spirit_animal|spirit animal]] and power totems. Near the beginning of the episode, Finn expresses interest in body modification. Moynihan inserted this reference to maintain continuity with the [[Adventure_Time_(season_2)|second season]] episode "[[Mortal_Folly_/_Mortal_Recoil|Mortal Folly]]", which features a scene with Finn [[daydreaming|daydreaming]] that he has a bionic arm.<ref name=jessewho/>

The episode guest stars both [[Tom_Gammill|Tom Gammill]] and [[Matthew_Broderick|Matthew Broderick]]. Gammill plays The Farm, a character that both Ward and Moynihan expressed an interest in bringing back to the show the DVD commentary for the episode.<ref name=jessewho>Moynihan, Jesse (Storyboard artist). 2014.

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode an "A–", applauding the installment's exploration and incorporation of Finn and Jake's friendship. He compared "Who Would Win" to the previous fourth season episode, "[[Sons_of_Mars|Sons of Mars]]", noting that both episode manage to "incorporate the show’s psychedelic imagery and silly toilet humor into stories that build on the relationship between the two bros {{sic}}."<ref name=avclubwin/> In terms of the action sequences in the episode, Sava also argued that the fight was paced similar to the fights between [[Peter_Griffin|Peter Griffin]] and [[List_of_Family_Guy_characters#Gag_characters|The Giant Chicken]] in the [[Fox_(TV_network)|Fox]] animated sitcom ''[[Family_Guy|Family Guy]]''.<ref name=avclubwin>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Review: Adventure Time: 'Who Would Win'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-who-would-win-84349|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
