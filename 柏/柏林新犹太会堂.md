'''柏林新犹太会堂'''兴建于1859–1866年，是德国柏林犹太人主要的[[犹太会堂|犹太会堂]]，位于奥拉宁堡大街（Oranienburger Straße）。其奢华的东方摩尔风格类似[[阿罕布拉宫|阿罕布拉宫]]，它是19世纪下半叶柏林重要的纪念建筑之一。 

这座建筑最初是由[[爱德华·克诺布劳赫|爱德华·克诺布劳赫]]设计。克诺布劳赫病倒后，弗里德里希·奥古斯特·Stüler负责起大部分的工程和内部设计。1866年竣工时普鲁士首相[[俾斯麦|俾斯麦]]到场。原有建筑在[[第二次世界大战|第二次世界大战]]之前和期间受到严重破坏，随后被夷为平地，1990年代重建。

<!-- ==历史==
The New Synagogue was built to accompany the growing Jewish population in Berlin, in particular, immigrants from the East. As the largest synagogue in Germany at the time, it seated 3,000 people. The building housed public concerts, including a violin concert with [[Albert_Einstein|Albert Einstein]] in 1930. With an [[organ_(music)|organ]] and a choir, the religious services reflected the liberal developments in the Jewish community of the time.<ref>Rebiger, 26</ref>

During the ''[[Kristallnacht|November Pogrom]]'' ([[9_November|9 November]] [[1938|1938]]), colloquially euphemised as Kristallnacht, the ''Neue Synagoge'' was set ablaze. Lieutenant [[Otto_Bellgardt|Otto Bellgardt]], the police officer of the local police precinct on duty that night, arrived on the scene early in the morning of 10 November and ordered the Nazi mob to disperse. He stated that the building was a protected historical landmark and drew his pistol, declaring that he would uphold the law requiring its protection. This allowed the fire brigade access to extinguish the fire, saving the synagogue from destruction.<ref>Scheer, 77</ref> Senior Lieutenant Wilhelm Krützfeld, head of the local police precinct, Bellgardt's superior, later covered up for him. Berlin's police commissioner [[Wolf-Heinrich_Graf_von_Helldorf|Graf Helldorf]] only verbally reprimanded Krützfeld for doing so and he is therefore often mistakenly revered<ref>Knobloch, passim and United States Holocaust Memorial Museum</ref> to as the rescuer of the ''New Synagogue''.<ref>Scheer, 78. Scheer explains that Heinz Knobloch popularised, that Wilhelm Krützfeld rescued the New Synagogue. Knobloch learned about the rescue by the report of an eyewitness, the late Hans Hirschberg. In 1938 still being a boy and the son of the tailor Siegmund Hirschberg, he later recalled that, his father and the police officer, being one of the tailor's clients and whom Hans assumed to be the head of the police precinct, got into a conversation, while the same police officer was supervising the work of the fire brigade, about their common wartime experiences in the same sector of the front. So when Knobloch researched for his book ''Der beherzte Reviervorsteher'' about the rescue of the New Synagogue, he figured out who was the head of the precinct, which was Krützfeld. But Krützfeld was never conscripted in WWI. But after Knobloch's book appeared another neighbour, Inge Held, Hirschberg and his sister in Israel confirmed that the rescuer was Otto Bellgardt. However, it is difficult to do away with the urban myth about Krützfeld being the rescuer.</ref> --> 

<!-- The New Synagogue, like the synagogue in Rykestr., stayed intact and continued to be used as synagogue until 1940. In 1940 the Wehrmacht seized both synagogues and used them as storage places. During [[World_War_II|World War II]], on November 22, 1943 the ''New Synagogue'' was heavily damaged by [[Allies_of_World_War_II|Allied]] bombing during the [[Battle_of_Berlin_(air)|Battle of Berlin]], a series of British air raids lasting from November 18, 1943 until March 25, 1944. The ruins of the building, except of the front section, were finally demolished in 1958. It was not until the collapse of the [[Berlin_Wall|Berlin Wall]] in 1989 that reconstruction began. From 1988 to 1993, the remains of the façade were restored as the "Centrum Judaicum" (lit. "Jewish Center"), without being constructed anew. In May 1995, the synagogue was partly revived, though it failed to regain its 19th century glory. After the renovations, only the front of the building with the restored dome remained -->.

<!-- Together with the New Synagogue, the whole [[Spandauer_Vorstadt|Spandauer Vorstadt]] (lit. "suburb towards Spandau") neighbourhood experienced a revival, with chic restaurants and [[boutique|boutique]]s opening up in the area, catering to an increasingly bourgeois clientèle. -->
