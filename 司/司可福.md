司可福（'''Cyrus Ingerson Scofield'''，{{BD|1843年|8月19日|1921年|7月24日}}）是一位[[美国|美国]]神学家。

== 生平 ==

司可福出生于美国伊利诺州<!-- [[Lenawee_County|Lenawee County]] -->，但在[[美国内战|美国内战]]期间他加入了南方军队（Confederate Army）田纳西第7步兵团一年。1866年他在圣路易斯在brother-in-law的律师事务所工作，1869年进入堪萨斯律师席，1871年作为共和党人当选进入堪萨斯州立法机构，1872年成为堪萨斯地区的<!--  appointed U.S. attorney.  Probably because of his alcoholism, he abandoned both his career and his wife and two daughters. Leotine Cerre Scofield divorced him in 1883, and the same year he married Hettie Hall von Wartz, with whom he had a son.<ref>Scofield's early life remains controverted.  It seems virtually certain that Scofield deliberately provided inaccurate information to ''Who's Who'' and to his biographer, Charles Trumball.</ref> -->
  
<!-- After his conversion to evangelical Christianity in 1879, Scofield assisted in the St. Louis campaign conducted by [[Dwight_L._Moody|Dwight L. Moody]] and served as the secretary of the St. Louis [[YMCA|YMCA]]. Significantly, Scofield came under the mentorship of [[James_H._Brookes|James H. Brookes]], pastor of Walnut Street Presbyterian Church, St. Louis, a prominent [[时代论|时代论]] [[premillennialism|premillennialist]]. --> 

1883年，司可福被按立成为一个[[公理会|公理会]]<!--   minister, and he accepted the pastorate of small mission church founded by that denomination, which became the First Congregational Church, Dallas, Texas (now [http://www.scofield.org/ Scofield Memorial Church]). The church grew from fourteen to over five hundred members before he resigned its pastorate in 1895. -->

1888年，司可福参加Niagara Bible Conference，在那里遇到了到中国的先锋传教士[[戴德生|戴德生]]. 二人成为终生的朋友<!--, 戴德生approach to Christian missions influenced Scofield to found the Central American Mission in 1890 <ref>现[http://www.caminternational.org/index.cfm?go=page&pid=33 CAM International] {{Wayback|url=http://www.caminternational.org/index.cfm?go=page&pid=33 |date=20120211143917 }}).Tucker, 304-305.</ref> -->

司可福<!--  also served as secretary of the American Home Missionary Society of Texas and Louisiana; and in 1890, he helped found Lake Charles College (1890-1903) in Lake Charles, Louisiana.  As the author of the pamphlet, “Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth” (1888), Scofield himself soon became a leader in dispensational premillennialism, a forerunner of 20世纪 Christian [[fundamentalism|fundamentalism]]. -->

1895年，司可福<!-- was called as pastor of Moody's church, the Trinitarian Congregational Church of [[East_Northfield,_Massachusetts|East Northfield, Massachusetts]], and he also took charge of Moody’s Northfield Bible Training School. Although, in theory, Scofield returned to his Dallas pastorate in 1903, his projected reference Bible consumed much of his energy, and for much of the time before its publication, he was either sick or in Europe.  Nevertheless, when the ''[[Scofield_Reference_Bible|Scofield Reference Bible]]'' was published in 1909, it quickly became the most influential statement of dispensational premillennialism, and Scofield's popularity as Bible conference speaker increased as his health continued to decline. -->

不久，司可福离开了自由化的公理会，加入美南长老会并搬到纽约市，<!--  where he supervised a correspondence and lay institute, the New York Night School of the Bible. In 1914 he founded the Philadelphia School of the Bible in 费城(now [[Philadelphia_Biblical_University|Philadelphia Biblical University]]). 

司可福的第二任妻子proved a faithful companion and editing assistant, but his relationships with his children seem to have been distant at best. 司可福1921年病逝於紐約長島Douglaston的自宅中。-->

== 宗教意义 ==

<!-- Scofield's correspondence Bible study course was the basis for his ''Reference Bible'', an annotated, and widely circulated, study Bible first published in [[1909|1909]] by Oxford University Press.  Scofield's notes teach [[时代论|时代论]], a theology that was in part conceived in the early nineteenth century by the Anglo-Irish [[John_Nelson_Darby|John Nelson Darby]], who like Scofield had also been trained as a lawyer.  Dispensationalism emphasizes the distinctions between the New Testament Church and ancient Israel of the Old Testament.  Scofield believed that between creation and the final judgment there were seven distinct eras of God's dealing with man and that these eras were a framework around which the message of the Bible could be explained. It was largely through the influence of Scofield's notes that 时代论 and premillennialism became influential among [[Christian_fundamentalism|fundamentalist Christians]] in 美国。 -->
