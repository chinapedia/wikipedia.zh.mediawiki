'''西馬里蘭觀光鐵路（Western Maryland Scenic Railroad）''' 是[[美國|美國]][[馬里蘭州|馬里蘭州]][[坎伯蘭_(馬里蘭州)|坎伯蘭]]的一條觀光鐵路，使用蒸汽機車與柴電機車，營運於坎伯蘭至[[弗羅斯特堡_(馬里蘭州)|弗羅斯特堡]]之間，前[[西馬里蘭鐵路|西馬里蘭鐵路]]的路線。一般列車編組有頭等與二等車廂，有時還有守車之旅（需預約）以及特別主題列車（如列車謀殺場景與節日特別列車）。

西馬里蘭觀光鐵路的坎伯蘭車站乃是興建於1913年的前[[西馬里蘭鐵路|西馬里蘭鐵路]]的坎伯蘭車站，該車站一樓有[[切薩皮克和俄亥俄運河|切薩皮克和俄亥俄運河]]國家史蹟公園的坎伯蘭遊客中心，展示運河的興建過程以及以運河維生的人們的生活展品。

==路線簡介==
本鐵路路線由坎伯蘭向西北，經過由[[波多馬克河|波多馬克河]]北支流{{link-en|威爾斯溪|Wills Creek (North Branch Potomac River)}}（Wills Creek）形成的坎伯蘭峽谷，兩側是{{link-en|黑斯泰克山|Haystack Mountain (Maryland)}}與{{link-en|威爾斯山|Wills Mountain}}，之後經由{{link-en|簡寧斯溪|Jennings Run}}河谷穿越{{link-en|薩維奇山|Savage Mountain}}，抵達前[[坎伯蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路|坎伯蘭與賓夕法尼亞鐵路]]的[[弗羅斯特堡_(馬里蘭州)|弗羅斯特堡]]車站。在此列車停留90分鐘，遊客可遊覽弗洛斯特堡，機車則在轉車台迴轉（該轉車台原使用於[[西馬里蘭鐵路|西馬里蘭鐵路]]的{{link-en|厄爾金斯|Elkins, West Virginia}}車站。列車之後循原路返回坎伯蘭。

沿途特殊景點包括
*凱許谷（Cash Valley）的賀姆斯提特彎（ Helmstetter’s Curve in Cash Valley），座標{{coord|39.678573|-78.807077 |format=dms |region:US-MD_type:landmark |name=Helmstetter's Curve}}
* [[布勒許隧道|布勒許隧道]]，座標{{coord|39|41|24|N|78|48|50|W |region:US-MD_type:landmark |name=Brush Tunnel}}
* 伍德寇克谷，此處鐵路路線是個髮夾彎。座標{{coord|39.683395|-78.857117 |format=dms |region:US-MD_type:landmark |name=Woodcock Hollow}}

阿利根尼高地步道（由坎伯蘭至匹茲堡的大阿利根尼自行車道的一部分）與西馬里蘭觀光鐵路的路線平行，遊客可將自行車交由列車託運，至弗羅斯特堡後沿此自行車道騎回坎伯蘭。

==鐵道機廠==
西馬里蘭觀光鐵路的機廠，在前西馬里蘭鐵路位於[[西維吉尼亞州|西維吉尼亞州]]{{link-en|里極利|Ridgeley, West Virginia}}的調車場（與坎伯蘭以波多馬克河相隔）。該處有辦公室、[[聯邦鐵路管理局|聯邦鐵路管理局]]的建築，以及舊塗裝工廠（現供停放蒸汽機車與維修鐵路設施之用）。該機廠也提供修復私人擁有或商業營運機車與客車的服務。在里極利場站南方還有一條三角線以供列車掉頭之用。

==車輛==
使用機車列表如下。

車廂方面，西馬里蘭觀光鐵路擁有不少輕量化客車廂，有些使用赭紅塗裝，有些維持不鏽鋼金屬原色，有些作為零件提供車以供修復其他車廂之用。許多車廂上漆有地名或人名以紀念對該鐵路有貢獻者。西馬里蘭觀光鐵路也從[[CSX運輸|CSX運輸]]等處取得一些貨車車廂，以供儲藏、路線維修，或是在舉辦特殊列車攝影時，編組成貨車以供攝影之用。西馬里蘭觀光鐵路目前也有三輛守車，其中兩輛前屬[[切薩皮克與俄亥俄鐵路|切薩皮克與俄亥俄鐵路]]，一輛前屬於[[西馬里蘭鐵路|西馬里蘭鐵路]]。

|Formerly used for passenger service by the [[Canadian_Pacific_Railway|Canadian Pacific Railway]], until December 1963. The following year, it was purchased by George M. Hart for use in excursion service for Rail Tours Inc.. However, the plans to restore the locomotive under Mart's ownership never came to fruition, and it was sold in August 1968 to Historic Rail Valley Equipment and Leasing Corp. In the early 1970s, the locomotive was sold to Jack Showalter for use in excursion service on the [[Allegany_Central_Railroad|Alleghany Central Railroad]] in [[Covington,_Virginia|Covington]], [[Virginia|Virginia]]. After the line had been ripped up, the Showalter relocated his railroad and locomotives in 1989 to Cumberland, which sprung the beginning of excursion service over this line. After the WMSR was officially founded in 1991, the Alleghany Central was relocated again to the [[Virginia_Central_Railroad|Virginia Central]] in [[Staunton,_Virginia|Staunton]]. After more than fifteen years of storage, No. 1238 was moved in September 2015 to Vintage Locomotive Society, better known as the [[Prairie_Dog_Central_Railway|Prairie Dog Central Railway]], in [[Winnipeg|Winnipeg]], were it is now owned by a private owner.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Canadian Pacific Class G1 4-6-2s|url=https://donsdepot.donrossgroup.net/dr582.htm|access-date=2021-06-22|website=donsdepot.donrossgroup.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Former Canadian Pacific 4-6-2s to move to Winnipeg from Virginia {{!}} Trains Magazine|url=https://www.trains.com/trn/news-reviews/news-wire/former-canadian-pacific-4-6-2s-to-move-to-winnipeg-from-virginia/|access-date=2021-06-22|website=Trains|language=en-US}}</ref>
