“'''生存还是毁灭'''”（{{lang-en|'''To be, or not to be'''}}），是[[莎士比亞|莎士比亞]]戲剧作品《[[哈姆雷特|哈姆雷特]]》第三幕第一場，哈姆雷特王子一段[[獨白|獨白]]的第一句前半部，很多人也會用這句來指整段獨白。在王子的演讲中，他考虑了死亡与自杀，哀叹这痛苦又不公的生活，也承认另一种选择可能会更糟。这段开场白是[[世界文學|世界文學]]、戏剧与音乐作品中常見被引用的一句，整句是：「生存还是毁灭，这是一个值得考虑的问题」（To be or not to be, that is the question）。

此版本的底本为第一对开本（1623），参照第二四开本（1604-1605）校订，并以现代正字法拼写。
:To be, or not to be, that is the question:
:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
:The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
:Or to take Arms against a Sea of troubles,
:And by opposing end them: to die, to sleep
:No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
:The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
:That Flesh is heir to? 'Tis a consummation
:Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep,
:To sleep, perchance to Dream; aye, there's the rub,
:For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
:When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
:Must give us pause. There's the respect
:That makes Calamity of so long life:
:For who would bear the Whips and Scorns of time,
:The Oppressor's wrong, the proud man's Contumely,
:The pangs of dispised Love, the Law’s delay,
:The insolence of Office, and the spurns
:That patient merit of th'unworthy takes,
:When he himself might his Quietus make
:With a bare Bodkin? Who would ''Fardels'' bear, [F: ''these Fardels'']
:To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
:But that the dread of something after death,
:The undiscovered country, from whose bourn
:No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
:And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
:Than fly to others that we know not of?
:Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
:And thus the native hue of Resolution
:Is sicklied o'er, with the pale cast of Thought,
:And enterprises of great ''pitch'' and moment, [F: ''pith'']
:With this regard their Currents turn ''awry'', [F: ''away'']
:And lose the name of Action. Soft you now,
:The fair Ophelia? Nymph, in thy Orisons
:Be all my sins remember'd.

=== 第一四开本文本 ===
第一四开本(Q1, 1603)是哈姆雷特最早的版本，但被认为是剧院演出时抄写的山寨版，而非剧作早期的草稿（因此被称为"坏四开本"）；Q1的某些地方确实和通行文本相符，但是在"生存还是毁灭"一段中问题颇多。例如行文中用"Hope"代替"dread"，与通行文本的意思大相径庭。此处的单词同样以现代正字法拼写。
:To be, or not to be, Ay there's the point,
:To Die, to sleep, is that all? Aye all:
:No, to sleep, to dream, aye marry there it goes,
:For in that dream of death, when we awake,
:And borne before an everlasting Judge,
:From whence no passenger ever returned,
:The undiscovered country, at whose sight
:The happy smile, and the accursed damn'd.
:But for this, the joyful hope of this,
:Who'd bear the scorns and flattery of the world,
:Scorned by the right rich, the rich cursed of the poor?
:The widow being oppressed, the orphan wrong'd,
:The taste of hunger, or a tyrants reign,
:And thousand more calamities besides,
:To grunt and sweat under this weary life,
:When that he may his full Quietus make,
:With a bare bodkin, who would this endure,
:But for a hope of something after death?
:Which puzzles the brain, and doth confound the sense,
:Which makes us rather bear those evils we have,
:Than fly to others that we know not of.
:Aye that, O this conscience makes cowards of us all,
:Lady in thy orizons, be all my sins remembered.

===第二四开本文本===
第二四开本（Q2, 1604-1605）被公认为本剧最早的可信版本（因此被称为"好四开本"）。在Q2中，整个场景发生的时间比Q1要晚：Q1中的场景直接发生于克劳迪斯和波洛涅斯计划之后；且Q2添加了"Soft you now"，表明哈姆雷特在讲话时没有（或假装没有）看到奥菲利亚。

:To be, or not to be, that is the question,
:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
:The slings and arrows of outragious fortune,
:Or to take Arms against a sea of troubles,
:And by opposing, end them, to die to sleep
:No more, and by a sleep, to say we end
:The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
:That flesh is heir too; tis a consumation
:Devoutly to be wish'd to die to sleep,
:To sleep, perhance to dream, ay, there's the rub,
:For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
:When we haue shuffled off this mortal coil
:Muſt giue vs pauſe, there's the reſpect
:That makes calamitie of ſo long life:
:For who would beare the whips and ſcorns of time,
:Th'oppreſſors wrong, the proude mans contumly,
:The pangs of deſpiz'd loue, the lawes delay,
:The inſolence of office, and the ſpurnes
:That patient merrit of the'vnworthy takes,
:When he himſelfe might his quietas make
:With a bare bodkin; who would fardels beare,
:To grunt and ſweat vnder a wearie life,
:But that the dread of ſomething after death,
:The vndiſcouer'd country, from whose borne
:No trauiler returnes, puzzels the will,
:And makes vs rather beare thoſe ills we haue,
:Then flie to others we know not of.
:Thus conſcience dooes make cowards,
:And thus the natiue hiew of reſolution
:Is ſickled ore with the pale caſt of thought,
:And enterpriſes of great pitch and moment,
:With this regard theyr currents turne awry,
:And loose the name of action. Soft you now,
:The faire Ophelia, Nimph in thy orizons
:Be all my ſinnes remembred.

===第一对开本文本===
1623年由Issac Jaggard和Ed Blount出版的《威廉·莎士比亚先生的喜剧、历史剧和悲剧》被称为"第一对开本" (F1)，其中收录的《哈姆雷特》文本与第二对开本基本相似，本段中，二者的不同基本在于排版：增加部分标点符号和大写字母。

:To be, or not to be, that is the Question:
:Whether ’tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
:The Slings and Arrows of outragious Fortune,
:Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles,
:And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleep
:No more; and by a sleep, to say we end
:The Heart-ake, and the thouſand Naturall ſhockes
:That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation
:Deuoutly to be wiſh'd. To dye to sleepe,
:To sleep, perchance to Dream; I, there's the rub,
:For in that sleep of death, what dreams may come,
:When we haue ſhufflel’d off this mortall coile,
:Muſt giue us pause. There's the respect
:That makes Calamity of long life:
:For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time,
:The Oppreſſors wrong, the poore mans Contumely,
:The pangs of diſpriz’d Loue, the Lawes delay,
:The inſolence of Office, and the Spurnes
:That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
:When he himſelfe might his Quietus make
:With a bare Bodkin? Who would theſe Fardles beare
:To grunt and ſweat vnder a weary life,
:But that the dread of ſomething after death,
:The vndiſcouered Countrey, from whoſe Borne
:No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will,
:And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue,
:Then flye to others that we know not of.
:Thus Conſcience does make Cowards of vs all,
:And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
:Is ſicklied o’re, with the pale caſt of Thought,
:And enterprizes of great pith and moment,
:With this regard their Currants turne away,
:And looſe the name of Action. Soft you now,
:The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons
:Be all my ſinnes remembred.

===朱生豪译文===
:生存还是毁灭，这是一个值得考虑的问题；默然忍受命运的暴虐的毒箭，或是挺身反抗人世的无涯的苦难，通过斗争把它们扫清，这两种行为，哪一种更高贵？死了；睡着了；什么都完了；要是在这一种睡眠之中，我们心头的创痛，以及其他无数血肉之躯所不能避免的打击，都可以从此消失，那正是我们求之不得的结局。死了；睡着了；睡着了也许还会做梦；嗯，阻碍就在这儿：因为当我们摆脱了这一具朽腐的皮囊以后，在那死的睡眠里，究竟将要做些什么梦，那不能不使我们踌躇顾虑。人們甘心久困于患难之中，也就是为了这个缘故；谁愿意忍受人世的鞭挞和讥嘲、压迫者的凌辱、傲慢者的冷眼、被轻蔑的爱情的惨痛、法律的迁延、官吏的横暴和费尽辛勤所换来的小人的鄙视，要是他只要用一柄小小的刀子，就可以清算他自己的一生？谁愿意负着这样的重担，在烦劳的生命的压迫下呻吟流汗，倘不是因为害怕不可知的死後，害怕那从来不曾有一个旅人回来过的神秘之國，是它迷惑了我们的意志，使我们寧愿忍受目前的折磨，不敢向我们所不知道的痛苦飞去？这样，重重的顾虑使我们全变成了懦夫，决心的赤热的光彩，被审慎的思维盖上了一层灰色，伟大的事业在这一种考虑之下，也会逆流而退，失去了行动的意义。且慢！美丽的奥菲利娅！——女神，在你的祈祷之中，不要忘记替我忏悔我的罪孽。<ref>{{Cite book|author=朱生豪|authorlink=朱生豪|title=莎士比亚戏剧集|chapter=哈姆雷特}}</ref>
