'''城鐵'''（{{lang-de|Stadtbahn}}，{{IPA-de|ˈʃtatˌbaːn}}）是[[有軌電車|有軌電車]]或[[輕軌|輕軌]]以[[城市軌道交通|城市軌道交通]]標準興建的路線，通常是改造成[[地鐵|地鐵]]過程的一部分，主要用於城市中心地帶以地鐵級別興建隧道。

城鐵網絡多數在1960年代及1970年代實施，目標希望建立全面的地鐵系統，但到了1980年代幾乎所有城市都因財政困難而放棄了這個目標。如今多數城鐵」系統是類似[[電車-火車系統|電車-火車系統]]，並設有地下車站。城鐵的概念最後由德國擴散至其他歐洲國家<ref name="newscientist">{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xgKLfKjjft8C&lpg=PA699&dq=&pg=PA699#v=onepage&q&f=false | author = Ian Yearsley | title=Trams are coming back | journal=[[New_Scientist|New Scientist]] | publisher=Reed Business Information Ltd. | quote = <!-- But West Germany, like other nations, experienced a phenomenal growth in private car ownership.
