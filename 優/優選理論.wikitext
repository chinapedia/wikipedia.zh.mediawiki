'''優選理論'''（{{lang-en|Optimality Theory}}，OT），又称'''優化理論'''、'''最優性理論'''、'''最適性理論'''、'''音律至善論'''等，是一種[[语言学|语言学]]模型，該理論認為語言表面可見的形式源自數個互相衝突的約制(constraints)之間的相互作用。優選理論不同於其他音韻分析方法，像是{{link-en|自動段音韻學|Autosegmental phonology}}（{{lang|en|Autosegmental phonology}}）及{{link-en|線性音韻學|The Sound Pattern of English}}（{{lang|en|SPE}}）等理論通常以規則(rules)描述而非限制(constraints)。優選理論將語法規則(grammars)模型化為一系統，此系統提供從輸入到輸出的[[映射|映射]](mapping)；基本上，輸入被視為[[底层形式|底层形式]]（{{lang|en|Underlying representation}}），而輸出則是[[底层形式|表层形式]]（surface representation）。

在語言學中，優選理論的起源於1991年"艾倫·普林斯"（Alan Prince）及"保羅·斯莫連斯基"（Paul Smolensky）的談話，<ref>"Optimality". Proceedings of the talk given at Arizona Phonology Conference, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.</ref>後來在由同作者於1993年的文章中發表出來。<ref>Prince, Alan, and Smolensky, Paul (1993) "Optimality Theory: Constraint interaction in generative grammar." Technical Report CU-CS-696-93, Department of Computer Science, University of Colorado at Boulder.</ref>

==理論==
優選理論有三個基本構成要件：
#GEN 選擇一個輸入(input)，並產生一系列可能的輸出(output)，或稱為候選項目，
#CON 提供準則，此準則以數個嚴密有序的可"違反約制"(violable constraint)之形式表示，用以決定候選項目，然後
#EVAL 根據這些限制選出的最佳候選項目，此項目即為輸出(output)。

優選理論假定這些構成要件具有普遍性。語法中的差異反映出CON組中各項具普遍性的約制有著不同的優先順序。[[語言習得|語言習得]]的部分進程因此可被描述為調整這些約制之優先順序的過程。

優選理論最初於1993年由語言學家{{link-en|艾倫·普林斯|Alan Prince}}（{{lang|en|Alan Prince}}）和{{link-en|保羅·斯莫連斯基|Paul Smolensky}}（{{lang|en|Paul Smolensky}}）所提出的，後來由艾倫·普林斯和{{link-en|約翰·J·麥卡錫|John J. McCarthy}}（{{lang|en|John J. McCarthy}}）接續發展此理論。雖然優選理論獲得的許多關注一直與其在[[音位學|音位學]]中的運用有關，優選理論最早也是被應用於此領域，但是該理論也適用於語言學的其他子領域(例如[[句法學|句法學]]和[[語義學|語義學]])。

優選理論如同其他[[生成語法|生成語法]]的各種理論，著重於{{link-en|普遍原則|Linguistic universal}}（{{lang|en|universal principle}}）、[[語言類型學|語言類型學]]及[[語言習得|語言習得]]方面的探索。

優選理論亦植基於[[人工神經網路|人工神經網路]]研究，此理論被提出，有幾分是為了要取代{{link-en|協和語法|Harmonic Grammar}}（{{lang|en|Harmonic grammar}}）的[[聯結主義|聯結主義]]理論，協和語法是於1990年由Géraldine Legendre、宮田義郎(Yoshiro Miyata)與{{link-en|保羅·斯莫連斯基|Paul Smolensky}}發展出來的理論。<ref>Paul Smolensky; Geraldine Legendre,"The Harmonic Mind: From Neural Computation to Optimality-theoretic Grammar Cognitive Architecture"[https://www.amazon.com/Harmonic-Mind-Computation-Optimality-Theoretic-Architecture/dp/0262516195/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1508753212&sr=8-1&keywords=The+Harmonic+Mind%3A+From+Neural+Computation+to+Optimality-theoretic+Grammar+Cognitive+Architecture],A Bradford Book; Reprint edition (January 21, 2011). ISBN 978-0262516198</ref>一些優選理論的變異理論裡存在偏重類聯結主義的約制，且在近期的研究裡持續被採用。

==輸入及GEN:候選集合== 
優選理論假設沒有任何特定語言輸入上的約制。這被稱為"基礎的寬容"(richness of the base)。每個語法都可以處理每一個可能的輸入。<!-- For example, a language without [[Consonant_cluster|complex clusters]] must be able to deal with an input such as /flask/. Languages without complex clusters differ on how they will resolve this problem; some will [[epenthesis|epenthesize]] (e.g. [falasak], or [falasaka] if all codas are banned) and some will [[deletion_(phonology)|delete]] (e.g. [fas], [fak], [las], [lak]). Given any input, GEN generates an infinite number of candidates, or possible realizations of that input.-->一種語言的語法（其約制排名）決定了哪些未定的候選項目將被 EVAL 評估為優選項目。

==CON：約制集==
在優選理論中，每個約束都是普遍的。CON 在每種語言中都是一樣等位的。有兩種基本類型的約制。<!--'''Faithfulness constraints''' require that the observed surface form (the output) match the underlying or lexical form (the input) in some particular way; that is, these constraints require identity between input and output forms. '''Markedness constraints''' impose requirements on the structural well-formedness of the output. Each plays a crucial role in the theory. Faithfulness constraints prevent every input from being realized as some unmarked form, and markedness constraints motivate changes from the underlying form.

The universal nature of CON makes some immediate predictions about language typology. If grammars differ only by having different rankings of CON, then the set of possible human languages is determined by the constraints that exist. Optimality theory predicts that there cannot be more grammars than there are permutations of the ranking of CON. The number of possible rankings is equal to the [[factorial|factorial]] of the total number of constraints, thus giving rise to the term ''Factorial Typology''. However, it may not be possible to distinguish all of these potential grammars, since not every constraint is guaranteed to have an observable effect in every language. Two languages could generate the same range of input-output mappings, but differ in the relative ranking of two constraints which do not conflict with each other. If rankings with ties are allowed, then the number of possibilities is an [[ordered_Bell_number|ordered Bell number]] rather than a factorial, allowing a significantly larger number of possibilities.<ref>{{citation|title=Review: The Best of All Possible Words (review of ''Optimality Theory: An Overview'', Archangeli, Diana & Langendoen, D. Terence, eds., Blackwell, 1997)|first1=T. Mark|last1=Ellison|first2=Ewan|last2=Klein|journal=Journal of Linguistics|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=127–143|jstor=4176645}}.</ref>-->

==EVAL：優選理論的定義==
<!--Given two candidates, A and B, A is better than B on a constraint if A incurs fewer violations than B. Candidate A is better than B on an entire constraint hierarchy if A incurs fewer violations of the highest-ranked constraint distinguishing A and B. A is optimal in its candidate set if it is better on the constraint hierarchy than all other candidates.
For example, given constraints C1, C2, and C3, where C1 dominates C2, which dominates C3 (C1 >> C2 >> C3), A is optimal if it does better than B on the highest ranking constraint which assigns them a different number of violations. If A and B tie on C1, but A does better than B on C2, A is optimal, even if A has 100 more violations of C3 than B. This comparison is often illustrated with a tableau. The [[index_(typography)|pointing finger]] marks the optimal candidate, and each cell displays an asterisk for each violation for a given candidate and constraint. Once a candidate does worse than another candidate on the highest ranking constraint distinguishing them, it incurs a crucial violation (marked in the tableau by an exclamation mark). Once a candidate incurs a crucial violation, there is no way for it to be optimal, even if it outperforms the other candidates on the rest of CON.

[[File:Optimality_Theory_Violation_Tableau.png|File:Optimality Theory Violation Tableau.png]]

Constraints are ranked in a hierarchy of strict domination. The ''strictness of strict domination'' means that a candidate who violates only a high-ranked constraint does worse on the hierarchy than one that doesn't, even if the second candidate fared worse on every other lower-ranked constraint. This also means that constraints are violable; the winning candidate need not satisfy all constraints. Within a language, a constraint may be ranked high enough that it is always obeyed; it may be ranked low enough that it has no observable effects; or, it may have some intermediate ranking. The term ''the emergence of the unmarked'' describes situations in which a markedness constraint has an intermediate ranking, so that it is violated in some forms, but nonetheless has observable effects when higher-ranked constraints are irrelevant.

An early example proposed by McCarthy & Prince (1994) is the constraint NoCoda, which prohibits syllables from ending in consonants. In [[Balangao|Balangao]], NoCoda is not ranked high enough to be always obeyed, as witnessed in roots like <code>taynan</code> (faithfulness to the input prevents deletion of the final /n/). But, in the [[reduplication|reduplicated]] form <code>ma-tayna-taynan</code> 'repeatedly be left behind', the final /n/ is not copied. Under McCarthy & Prince's analysis, this is because faithfulness to the input does not apply to reduplicated material, and NoCoda is thus free to prefer <code>ma-tayna-taynan</code> over hypothetical <code>ma-taynan-taynan</code> (which has an additional violation of NoCoda). Constraints are also violable; the winning candidate need not satisfy all constraints, as long as for any rival candidate that does better than the winner on some constraint, there is a ''higher'' ranked constraint on which the winner does better than that rival.

Some optimality theorists prefer the use of comparative tableaux, as described in Prince (2002). Comparative tableaux display the same information as the classic or "flyspeck" tableaux, but the information is presented in such a way that it highlights the most crucial information. For instance, the tableau above would be rendered in the following way.

{| class="wikitable"
|+Comparative tableau
|-
! !! C1 !! C2 !! C3
|-
! A ~ B
|  e || W || L
|-
|}

Each row in a comparative tableau represents a winner-loser pair, rather than an individual candidate. In the cells where the constraints assess the winner-loser pairs, there is a W if the constraint in that column prefers the winner, an L if the constraint prefers the loser, and an e if the constraint does not differentiate between the pair. Presenting the data in this way makes it easier to make generalizations. For instance, in order to have a consistent ranking ''some'' W must dominate ''all'' L's. Brasoveanu and Prince (2005) describe a process known as fusion and the various ways of presenting data in a comparative tableau in order to achieve the necessary and sufficient conditions for a given argument.

==Example==
As a simplified example, consider the manifestation of the English plural:

{{IPA|/ˈkæt/ + /z/ → [ˈkæts]}} (cats)(also smirks, hits, crepes)

{{IPA|/ˈdɒɡ/ + /z/ → [ˈdɒɡz]}} (dogs)(also [[wug_test|wug]]s, clubs, moms)

{{IPA|/ˈdɪʃ/ + /z/ → [ˈdɪʃɨz]}} (dishes)(also classes, glasses, bushes)

Also consider the following constraint set, in descending order of domination (M: markedness, F: faithfulness):

M: *SS - Sibilant-Sibilant clusters are ungrammatical: one violation for every pair of adjacent [[sibilants|sibilants]] in the output.

M: Agree(Voi) - Agree in specification of [voi]: one violation for every pair of adjacent [[obstruent|obstruent]]s in the output which disagree in voicing.

F: Max - Maximize all input segments in the output: one violation for each segment in the input that doesn't appear in the output (This constraint prevents deletion).

F: Dep - Output segments are dependent on having an input correspondent: one violation for each segment in the output that doesn't appear in the input (This constraint prevents insertion).

F: Ident(Voi) - Maintain the identity of the [voi] specification: one violation for each segment that differs in voicing between the input and output.

No matter how the constraints are re-ordered, the 'is' allomorph will always lose to 'iz'. This is called ''harmonic bounding''. The violations incurred by the candidate 'dogiz' are a subset of the violations incurred by 'dogis'; specifically, if you epenthesize a vowel, changing the voicing of the morpheme is gratuitous violation of constraints. In the 'dog + z' tableau, there is a candidate 'dogz' which incurs no violations whatsoever. Within the constraint set of the problem, 'dogz' harmonically bounds all other possible candidates. This shows that a candidate does not need to be a winner in order to harmonically bound another candidate.

The tableaux from above are repeated below using the comparative tableaux format.

{| class="wikitable"
|+dog + z > dogz
|-
! dog + z!! *SS !! Agree !! Max !! Dep !! Ident
|-
! dogz ~ dogiz
| e || e || e || W || e
|-
! dogz ~ dogis
| e || e || e || W || W
|-
! dogz ~ dog
| e || e || W || e || e
|-
! dogz ~ dogs
| e || W   || e || e || W
|-
|}

From the above tableau for ''dog + z'', it can be observed that any ranking of these constraints will produce the observed output ''dogz''. Because there are no loser-preferring comparisons, ''dogz'' wins under any ranking of these constraints; this means that no ranking can be established on the basis of this input.

{| class="wikitable"
|+cat + z > cats
|-
! cat + z!! *SS !! Agree !! Max !! Dep !! Ident
|-
! cats ~ catiz
| e || e || e || W || L
|-
! cats ~ catis
| e || e || e || W || e
|-
! cats ~ catz
| e || W || e || e || L
|-
! cats ~ cat
| e || e || W || e || L
|-
|}

The tableau for ''cat + z'' contains rows with a single W and a single L. This shows that Agree, Max, and Dep must all dominate Ident; however, no ranking can be established between those constraints on the basis of this input. Based on this tableau, the following ranking has been established:
:'''Agree, Max, Dep >> Ident'''

{| class="wikitable"
|+dish + z > dishiz
|-
! dish + z!! *SS !! Agree !! Max !! Dep !! Ident
|-
! dishiz ~ dishis
| e || e || e || e || W
|-
! dishiz ~ dishz
| W || W || e || L || e
|-
! dishiz ~ dish
| e || e ||  W || L || e
|-
! dishiz ~ dishs
| W || e || e || L || W
|-
|}

This tableau shows that several more rankings are necessary in order to predict the desired outcome. The first row says nothing; there is no loser-preferring comparison in the first row. The second row reveals that ''either'' *SS '''or''' Agree must dominate Dep, based on the comparison between ''dishiz'' and ''dishz''. The third row shows that Max '''must''' dominate Dep. The final row shows that ''either'' *SS '''or''' Ident must dominate Dep. From the ''cat + z'' tableau, it was established that Dep dominates Ident; this means that *SS '''must''' dominate Dep.

So far, the following rankings have been shown to be necessary:
:'''*SS, Max >> Dep >> Ident'''

While it is possible that Agree ''can'' dominate Dep, it is not necessary; the ranking given above is sufficient for the observed for ''fishiz'' to emerge.

When the rankings from the tableaux are combined, the following ranking summary can be given:
:'''*SS, Max >> Agree, Dep >> Ident'''
::::::or
:'''*SS, Max, Agree >> Dep >> Ident'''

There are two possible places to put Agree when writing out rankings linearly; neither is truly accurate. The first implies that *SS and Max must dominate Agree, and the second implies that Agree must dominate Dep. Neither of these are truthful, which is a failing of writing out rankings in a linear fashion like this. These sorts of problems are the reason why most linguists utilize a [[Lattice_(order)|lattice graph]] to represent necessary and sufficient rankings, as shown below.

[[File:Lattice.jpg|Lattice graph of necessary and sufficient rankings]]

A diagram that represents necessary rankings of constraints in this style is a [[Hasse_diagram|Hasse diagram]].-->

==批評==
<!--Optimality theory has attracted substantial amounts of criticism, most of which is directed at its application to phonology (rather than syntax or other fields).<ref>Chomsky (1995)</ref><ref>Dresher (1996)</ref><ref>Hale & Reiss (2008)</ref><ref>Halle (1995)</ref><ref>Idsardi (2000)</ref><ref>Idsardi (2006)</ref>

It is claimed that optimality theory cannot account for [[phonological_opacity|phonological opacity]] (see Idsardi 2000, e.g.). In derivational phonology effects may be seen that are inexplicable at the surface level but which are explainable through "opaque" rule ordering; but in optimality theory, which has no intermediate levels for rules to operate on, these effects are difficult to explain.

For example, in Québécois French high front vowels triggered affrication of {{IPA|/t/}}, (e.g. {{IPA|/tipik/ → [tˢpɪk]}}) but the loss of high vowels (visible at the surface level) leaves the affrication with no apparent source. Derivational phonology can explain this by saying that vowel syncope (the loss of the vowel) "counterbled" affrication - that is, instead of vowel syncope occurring and "[[bleeding_order|bleeding]]" (i.e. preventing) affrication, we say that affrication applies before vowel syncope, so that the high vowel is removed and the environment destroyed which had triggered affrication. Such counterbleeding rule orderings are therefore termed opaque (instead of transparent), because their effects are not visible at the surface level.

The opacity of such phenomena finds no straightforward explanation in optimality theory, since intermediate forms are not accessible (constraints refer only to the surface form and/or the underlying form). There have however been a number of proposals designed to account for it; but most of these proposals significantly alter optimality theory's basic architecture, and therefore tend to be highly controversial. Frequently, such alterations add new types of constraints (which are not universal faithfulness or markedness constraints), or change the properties of GEN (such as allowing for serial derivations) or EVAL. Some well-known examples of these include John J. McCarthy's sympathy theory and candidate chains theory, and there are many others.

A relevant issue is the existence of circular [[chain_shift|chain shift]]s, i.e. cases where input /X/ maps to output [Y], but input /Y/ maps to output [X]. Many versions of optimality theory predict this to be impossible (see Moreton 2004, Prince 2007).

Optimality theory is also criticized as being an impossible model of speech production/perception: computing and comparing an infinite number of possible candidates would take an infinitely long time to process. Idsardi (2006) argues this position, though other linguists dispute this claim on the grounds that Idsardi makes unreasonable assumptions about the constraint set and candidates, and that more moderate instantiations of optimality theory do not present such big [[computational_problem|computational problem]]s (see Kornai (2006) and Heinz, Kobele, and Riggle (2009)).  Another common rebuttal to this criticism of optimality theory is that the framework is purely representational. In this view, optimality theory is taken to be a model of [[linguistic_competence|linguistic competence]] and is therefore not intended to explain the specifics of [[linguistic_performance|linguistic performance]].<ref>Kager, René (1999). Optimality theory. Section 1.4.4: Fear of infinity, pp. 25–27.</ref><ref>Prince, Alan and Paul Smolensky. (2004): ''Optimality Theory: Constraint Interaction in Generative Grammar''. Section 10.1.1: Fear of Optimization, pp. 215–217.</ref>

Another objection to optimality theory is the claim that it is not technically a theory, in that it does not make falsifiable predictions. The source of this issue is terminology: the term "theory" is used differently here than in physics, chemistry, and other sciences. Specific instantiations of optimality theory may make falsifiable predictions, in the same way that specific proposals within other linguistic frameworks can. What predictions are made, and whether they are testable, depends on the specifics of individual proposals (most commonly, this is a matter of the definitions of the constraints used in an analysis). Thus, optimality theory as a framework is best described as a [[Paradigm#Scientific_paradigm|scientific paradigm]].<ref>de Lacy (editor). (2007). ''The Cambridge Handbook of Phonology'', p. 1.</ref>

Some criticisms of optimality theory appear to be based on a misunderstanding of how it works. A well-known example of this is [[Noam_Chomsky|Noam Chomsky's]] widely-repeated assertion that optimality theory would predict every lexical input to be reduced to a single optimal syllable (e.g. every word is realized as [ba]).<ref>Chomsky (1995)</ref> In fact, under the premises of optimality theory universal neutralization of this type would only be predicted if there were no faithfulness constraints (see McCarthy 1997). In a sense, the diametrically opposite kind of criticism comes from Morris Halle: "... the existence of phonology in every language shows that Faithfulness is at best an ineffective principle that might well be done without."<ref>Halle (1995)</ref> By "phonology," Halle clearly means disparity between inputs and outputs of a phonological system. Optimality theory would fail to predict such deviations from an underlying form only if there were no markedness constraints.<ref>Prince (2007), pp. 22-24</ref> In OT, input-output disparity is normally understood as the result of markedness constraints being ranked over faithfulness constraints (M >> F).-->

==優選理論中的理論==
<!--In practice, implementations of optimality theory often assume other related theories, such as [[Syllable|Syllable]] theory, Moraic theory, or Feature Geometry. Completely distinct from these, there are sub-theories which have been proposed entirely within optimality theory, such as [[positional_faithfulness_theory|positional faithfulness theory]], correspondence theory (McCarthy & Prince 1995), sympathy theory, and a number of theories of learnability, most notably by [[Bruce_Tesar|Bruce Tesar]].
There are also a range of theories specifically about optimality theory. These are concerned with issues like the possible formulations of constraints, and constraint interactions other than strict domination.-->

==在語音學之外的使用==
<!--Optimality Theory is most commonly associated with the field of [[phonology|phonology]], but has also been applied to other areas of linguistics. [[Jane_Grimshaw|Jane Grimshaw]], [[Geraldine_Legendre|Geraldine Legendre]] and [[Joan_Bresnan|Joan Bresnan]] are well known for developing instantiations of OT within [[syntax|syntax]].<ref>McCarthy, John (2001). A Thematic Guide to Optimality Theory, Chapter 4: Connections of Optimality Theory.</ref><ref>Legendre, Grimshaw & Vikner (2001)</ref> Optimality theoretic approaches are also relatively prominent in morphology (and the morphology-phonology interface in particular).<ref>Trommer (2001)</ref><ref>Wolf (2008)</ref>-->

==優選論的發展和修正==

===制約條件合取===
能較好解釋WOW、對分析因元音和諧、音段中和、強制性非同值原則(OCP[[無雙原則|無雙原則]])變化，還有推導環境效應、祖父效應、鏈移現象等連續推導引起的音系晦暗現象很有幫助，至少提供了新的解決思路。
(複合體[[制約條件|制約條件]]的排列規則限制了OT制約條件的[[階乘|階乘]]類型factorial type)

===重複和共謀問題(repulication & conspiracy)===

OT的[[並行處理|並行處理]](parallelism)模式通過制約條件(如[[格雷斯曼|格雷斯曼]]定律、[[顎化|顎化]]、[[音叢|音叢]]減少)[[交互作用|交互作用]](alternation)能較SPE更好的解決重複問題(包括構詞重複、超音段重複等)。

===[[音系晦暗|音系晦暗]]問題(opacity)===

由於OT對音系晦暗現象的無奈，於是產生了推導性OT模式「有限和諧序列論」、分層優選論、對應理論、[[共感論|共感論]](Sympathy和應論)、還有比較標記理論以及優選論候選項鏈式理論。
