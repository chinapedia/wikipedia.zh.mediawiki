'''湧現'''或稱'''創發'''、'''突現'''、'''呈展'''（{{lang-en|emergence}}）是一種[[現象|現象]]，為許多小實體交互作用後產生了大實體，而這個大實體展現了組成它的小實體所不具有的特性。

==定義==
許多人都曾定義過“湧現”這個概念，包括[[亞里士多德|亞里士多德]]<ref name="MetaH">[[Aristotle|Aristotle]], ''[[Metaphysics_(Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Book H 1045a 8-10: "... the totality is not, as it were, a mere heap, but the whole is something besides the parts ...", i.e., the whole is greater than the sum of the parts.</ref>、[[約翰·斯圖爾特·密爾|約翰·斯圖爾特·密爾]]<ref>"The chemical combination of two substances produces, as is well known, a third substance with properties different from those of either of the two substances separately, or of both of them taken together" {{Harv|Mill|1843}}</ref>、[[朱利安·赫胥黎|朱利安·赫胥黎]]<ref>與[[朱利安·赫胥黎|朱利安·赫胥黎]]: "now and again there is a sudden rapid passage to a totally new and more comprehensive type of order or organization, with quite new emergent properties, and involving quite new methods of further evolution" {{Harv|Huxley|Huxley|1947}}</ref>與{{link-en|喬治·亨利·劉易斯|George Henry Lewes}}<ref>{{Harv|Blitz|1992}}
"Every resultant is either a sum or a difference of the co-operant forces; their sum, when their directions are the same -- their difference, when their directions are contrary.  Further, every resultant is clearly traceable in its components, because these are homogeneous and commensurable. It is otherwise with emergents, when, instead of adding measurable motion to measurable motion, or things of one kind to other individuals of their kind, there is a co-operation of things of unlike kinds. The emergent is unlike its components insofar as these are incommensurable, and it cannot be reduced to their sum or their difference." {{Harv|Lewes|1875|p=412}}
</ref>。{{link-en|Jeffrey Goldstein}}則對湧現作以下定義：<ref>原文 "the arising of novel and coherent structures, patterns and properties during the process of self-organization in complex systems".</ref>{{quote|複雜系統中在自我組織的過程中，所產生的各種新奇且清晰的結構、圖案、和特性。}}

湧現中有兩種學派的看法：弱湧現中，元素層面的互動會造成新的特質出現，而突現特質可以化約到其個別的成分，通常是[[決定論|決定論]]者的觀點；強湧現裡，新特質是無法化約的，是超過各部分的總和的。<ref>{{cite isbn|9789862621295}}</ref>
