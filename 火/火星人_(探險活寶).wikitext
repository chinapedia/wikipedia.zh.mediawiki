<!--==劇情==
Magic Man (voiced by [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]]) is spotted by his four-headed Martian brother Grob Gob Glob Grod, who are planning on bringing Magic Man back to Mars to face trial for his many crimes. Magic Man soon runs into Finn and Jake, and knocks them both unconscious. He then physically turns himself into Jake, and transforms Jake into him. Grob Gob Glob Grod, not realizing the difference, seizes Jake and rockets off to Mars. Finn, aware of the charade, forces Magic Man to take him to his house in order to find something that can help him save Jake. Magic Man's house, however, is completely derelict, and is a reflection of Magic Man's "sick mind". For instance, plants and animals live wildly in the structure, and a tiny Manticore is kept in a glass jar, apparently for Magic Man's amusement.

Finn discovers a Martian teleporter that was given to Magic Man in the hopes that he would learn love and voluntarily return to his home planet. Finn warps to Mars, and witnesses Jake being put on trial in front of [[Abraham_Lincoln|Abraham Lincoln]], the King of Mars. Magic Man is found guilty, and while Jake tries to plead his case, it falls on deaf ears. Lincoln gives Jake two options: he can either be put to death with the Wand of Disbursement, or Lincoln can use the power of the wand to turn him into living star dust. Before Jake can answer, Finn intervenes, accidentally causing the wand to touch Jake, killing him. Lincoln, realizing his mistake, travels to the 37th Dead World and pleads with Death; in exchange for Jake's soul, Lincoln offers up his [[immortality|immortality]]. Finn and Jake then rocket back to Earth and punch Magic Man in the face. Finn then frees the tiny Manticore.

"Sons of Mars" was written and storyboarded by Jesse Moynihan and Ako Castuera, from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], Patrick McHale, [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], Moynihan, and [[Doug_TenNapel|Doug TenNapel]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Sons of Mars| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Larry Leichliter (director); Jesse Moynihan & Ako Castuera (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=July 23, 2012 | season = 4 | number = 15}}</ref> TenNapel had previously written the storyboard for the scrapped [[Adventure_Time_(season_1)|first season]] episode "The Glorriors".<ref>{{cite web|last=Seibert|first=Fred|title='The Glorriors' Storyboard|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/37568763/The-Glorriors-Storyboard|publisher=[[Scribd|Scribd]]|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}</ref> The reason he was credited for "Sons of Mars" was because the scene featuring Lincoln interacting with Death was very similar to a scene he boarded in a scrapped season one episode.<ref name=episodecredits/><ref>{{cite web|last=Muto|first=Adam|title=What parts of the story for 'Sons of Mars' did Doug TenNapel pitch?|url=http://new.spring.me/#!/GunterFan/q/553171980812043603|publisher=[[Formspring|Formspring]]|accessdate=January 30, 2014}}</ref> The entry was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref name=episodecredits/> According to Moynihan, the episode was originally supposed to be connected to the third season episode "Ghost Princess"; in Moynihan's original story, the premise involved both Ghost Princess and Magic Man. In the end, after "extensive meetings" with the show's writing staff, Moynihan decided to rewrite the episode so that it would serve as a sequel to Magic Man's story.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moynihan|first=Jesse|title=Adventure Time Update|url=http://jessemoynihan.com/?p=1676|publisher=JesseMoynihan.com|accessdate=February 5, 2013|date=July 20, 2012}}</ref> The name "Margles" was a reference to Moynihan's Jesse's ex-girlfriend Margaret. Moynihan envisioned the episode as a way to negate any negative energy about their relationship and breakup and "exercise [the energy] from his heart".<ref name=jessemars/>

A large portion of the episode's original draft featured Finn and Jake discovering a strange naturalistic temple inscribed with carvings of Abraham Lincoln. These scenes were excised due to the time constraints of the episode, and creative director Nate Cash storyboarded a shorter scene—featuring Finn and Jake carrying a broken robot—to take the removed material's place.<ref name=natemars>Cash, Nate (Creative director). 2014. "Sons of Mars" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref><ref name=jessemars/> Ward was very conscientious in how Lincoln was portrayed in the episode; he wanted him to be exclusively referred to as "King of Mars". This was because he felt Lincoln's appearance in the pilot was solely for cheap laughs. For "Sons of Mars", Ward wanted his appearance to have real meaning.<ref name=wardmars>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014.

Several characters make reappearances in this episode. First and foremost it marks the return of Magic Man, voiced by Kenny, who had originally appeared in the first season episode "Freak City".<ref>{{cite episode| title=Freak City | series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Larry Leichliter (director); Pendleton Ward & Tom Herpich (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=July 26, 2010 | season = 1 | number = 20}}</ref><ref name=frederatorarchivesom>{{cite web|title=Tom Kenny is Back as Magic Man|url=http://pwcartoons.frederator.com/post/27631850998/my-juice-tom-kenny-is-back-as-magic-man-in|publisher=[[Frederator|Frederator]]|accessdate=June 19, 2013|archiveurl=http://fluttersly.tumblr.com/post/27649555798/adventuretime-my-juice-tom-kenny-is-back-as|archivedate=July 2012|date=July 2012}}</ref> The episode also features the return appearance of Lincoln as the king of Mars.<ref name=sonsofmarsav/> Lincoln had originally appeared in the series' [[Pilot_(Adventure_Time)|pilot episode]] in 2007.<ref name=sonsofmarsav/> The episode marks the first appearance of the oft-mentioned deity Grob Gob Glob Grod;  Moynihan had crafted the character in order to [[retcon|retcon]] why various names had been ascribed to the being.<ref name=jessemars>Moynihan, Jesse (Storyboard artist). 2014.
