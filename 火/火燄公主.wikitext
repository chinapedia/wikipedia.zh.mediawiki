<!--==劇情==
After Princess Bubblegum (voiced by [[Hynden_Walch|Hynden Walch]]) scorns his advances, Finn falls into a serious depression and sings a woeful song about the romantic pain he feels, called "All Gummed Up Inside". Jake, worried about his brother, decides to find Finn a new love interest, and so he journeys to the Fire Kingdom, ruled by the evil Flame King (voiced by [[Keith_David|Keith David]]).

Jake bluffs that he is an emissary of "Prince Finn", ruler of the Grasslands. Jake attempts to court Flame King's daughter, Flame Princess (voiced by [[Jessica_DiCicco|Jessica DiCicco]]) on Finn's behalf. After several disastrous attempts, including a performance of a song called "All Warmed Up Inside", Jake is told to leave. However, he uses his shape-shifting abilities to morph part of his body and make it look as if Finn has entered the palace. Jake-as-Finn then pretends to strangle Jake, which appeases Flame King. He applauds Finn's supposed butchery, agreeing to give him the hand of his evil daughter.

Jake, distressed that Flame Princess is apparently evil, flees back to the Tree Fort, with the princess on his trails. Once there, Jake tries to explain what happened to Finn, but a struggle breaks out. In the confusion, Flame Princess is nearly killed by [[rain|rain]], but Finn saves her. When she regains her powers, she slaps him, warning him never to mess with her. The episode concludes with Finn noting that he now has a crush on Flame Princess.

"Incendium" was written and storyboarded by Adam Muto and [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]] from a story developed by Mark Banker, [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], Osborne, and series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]]. This was both the last episode to have been boarded by Sugar and Muto as a team, as well as the last to credit Muto as a storyboard artist; he was later promoted to creative director for the entirety of [[Adventure_Time_(season_4)|season four]], as well as the first half of [[Adventure_Time_(season_5)|season five]].<ref name=tumblrmain>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rebecca|title='Incendium' Promo|url=http://rebeccasugar.tumblr.com/post/17521219188/incendium-promo-the-last-episode-i-wrote-and|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=January 18, 2014|date=February 12, 2012}}</ref>

The impetus for this episode was the writers and producers not wanting to keep writing episodes in which Finn is continuously rejected by Princess Bubblegum.<ref name=adamfire/> Because of the thematic undertones of romance and unrequited love, the episode had several emotional beats. Sugar later explained that, since she had first started on the show, she had attempted to storyboard a situation causing Finn to cry. Ward and the producers had vetoed this idea several times, because they felt it did not fit his personality. However, with "Incendium", Sugar noted that "the dam finally broke" and she was allowed to make Finn cry over his unreciprocated love of Princess Bubblegum.<ref name=tumblrmain/> Sugar put as much "gut-wrenching imagery" at the start of the episode in order to emphasize the installment's [[pathos|pathos]].<ref name=sugarfire/> Similarly, she "wanted to make Finn lose it" near the end to show how much his love of Princess Bubblegum was hurting him. As such, the fact that Finn chooses to save Flame Princess over the lock bubblegum's hair was used as a metaphor by the writers to show that Finn was getting over his fixation with Bubblegum.<ref name=sugarfire/>

The episode introduced Flame Princess, who would become a more important character in the following seasons; the character is voiced by Jessica DiCicco.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flame Princess|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/tv-shows/Adventure-Time/Flame-Princess/|publisher=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Flamefacts">{{cite web|title=Character Facts of the Week: Flame Princess from Adventure Time|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/blogs/character-facts-of-the-week-flame-princess-from-adventure-time|publisher=[[Cartoon_Network|CartoonNetwork.co.uk]]|accessdate=October 26, 2012|date=May 26, 2012}}</ref> Flame Princess was written to be "clueless", in that she was emotionally more immature than any of the other characters. This allowed other, usually immature characters like Finn to play off of her in a different and unique way.<ref name=adamfire>Muto, Adam (Storyboard artist). 2014.

"Incendium" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Three [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> This drawing was later cleaned-up by Sugar; originally, she envisioned Flame Princess as being similar in coloring to a match, with "dark skin and fire for hair". Her sketches were later redesigned for the show by [[Andy_Ristaino|Andy Ristaino]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rebecca|title=Early Flame Princess Sketches|url=http://rebeccasugar.tumblr.com/post/17668029586/early-flame-princess-sketches-early-on-i-thought|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=January 18, 2014|date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> When Sugar was redesigning the character, she added a gem in the middle of her forehead, which she claimed was inspired by the rudimentary character designs for the characters in her series ''[[Steven_Universe|Steven Universe]]'', which would air several years later.<ref name=sugarfire/>

Dean Childers of TV Geek Army gave the episode a largely positive review, noting that it was "particularly well done."<ref name=geekarmy/> He noted that the twist that Flames Princess was evil was "great comedy" even though it "comes out of nowhere", and he also felt that the ending allowed for the episode to reach a higher level of excitement and interest.<ref name=geekarmy/> He also applauded the voice acting in the episode, writing, "[Keith David's] regal voice works wonderfully as a king in the world of Oo {{sic}} and his daughter [DiCicco] isn't lacking in the voice over department either."<ref name=geekarmy>{{cite web|last1=Childers|first1=Dean|title=Adventure Time, 'Incendium': Finn Has a New Love Interest?|url=http://tvgeekarmy.com/post/viewpost/adventure-time-incendium-finn-has-a-new-love-interest|publisher=TV Geek Army|accessdate=September 16, 2014|date=February 14, 2012}}</ref>
