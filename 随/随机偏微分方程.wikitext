'''随机偏微分方程'''（英文：Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs)）[[类似|类似]]于一般的[[随机微分方程|随机微分方程]]。其本质上是带有[[随机|随机]][[项|项]]和随机[[系数|系数]]的[[偏微分方程|偏微分方程]]。随机微分方程在[[量子场论|量子场论]]、[[统计力学|统计力学]]、[[金融数学|金融数学]]中有着广泛的应用。

== Examples ==
One of the most studied SPDEs is the stochastic [[heat_equation|heat equation]], which may formally be written as

:<math>
\partial_t u = \Delta u + \xi\;,
</math>

where <math>\Delta</math> is the [[Laplacian|Laplacian]] and <math>\xi</math> denotes space-time [[white_noise|white noise]].

== Discussion ==
One difficulty is their lack of regularity. In one space dimension, solutions to the stochastic heat equation are only almost 1/2-[[Hölder_continuous|Hölder continuous]] in space and 1/4-Hölder continuous in time. For dimensions two and higher, solutions are not even function-valued, but can be made sense of as random [[Distribution_(mathematics)|distributions]].
