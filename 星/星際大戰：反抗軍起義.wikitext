《'''星球大戰：反抗軍起義'''》（{{lang-en|''Star Wars: Rebels''}}）是由迪士尼在2014年所推出的星際大戰系列的電視動畫劇集，是 2012 年迪士尼收購[[盧卡斯影業|盧卡斯影業]]後，雙方攜手共同推出的第一部作品。這部動畫延續經典電影系列，劇情講述在第三部的14年後，即第四部發生前5年的時間，也就是從《[[絕地大屠殺|第 66 號密令]]》執行之後，銀河中的[[絕地武士|絕地武士]]被大舉屠殺的黑暗時期說起。[[達斯·維達|達斯·維達]]、[[達斯·魔|達斯·魔爾]]、[[歐比王·肯諾比|歐比王·肯諾比]]、[[威爾霍夫·塔金|威爾霍夫·塔金]]、[[莉亞公主|莉亞公主]]、[[貝奧·歐嘉納|貝奧·歐嘉納]]、[[藍道·卡利森|藍道·卡利森]]、蒙·莫斯瑪，以及機器人[[R2-D2|R2-D2]]、[[C-3PO|C-3PO]]等經典角色，都以[[3D|3D]][[動畫|動畫]]樣貌呈現。

== 製作過程 ==
《星際大戰：反抗軍起義》的執行製作人{{le|戴夫·費奧尼|Dave Filoni}}在接受[[紐約時報|紐約時報]]專訪時表示，他本身自幼便是一名星戰迷，而他在製作這部動畫時，腦中並沒有「超越經典」這樣的想法，他被盧卡斯影業所賦予的任務，是藉由這部卡通，讓舊的粉絲以及新世代的觀眾，重新回到《星際大戰》的世界裡。因此，在這部全新動畫的一開始，便安排了[[滅星者|滅星者]]（Star Destroyer）劃過星空，熟悉的影像、熟悉的配樂，便是為了滿足星戰粉絲們所設計；但5名全新創造的反抗軍小隊成員，則是為了6至14歲兒童以及青少年，沒有看過星戰電影的新一代觀眾而量身打造。

== 劇情概要 ==
本故事時間是發生在《[[星際大戰三部曲：西斯大帝的復仇|星際大戰三部曲：西斯大帝的復仇]]》過後14年，《[[星際大戰四部曲：曙光乍現|星際大戰四部曲：曙光乍現]]》的前5年之間，主要是在講述在新的希望來臨前，反抗軍英勇對抗邪惡的帝國的故事。在[[第66號密令|第66號密令]]執行之後，銀河中的絕地武士被大舉屠殺，而在這期間銀河系被黑暗勢力所籠罩，由西斯大帝所率領的帝國軍實施高壓統治。反抗軍只能占領一顆遙遠的星球，在這裡整軍待發伺機而動。他們不但必須求生存，還要面對源源不絕的[[帝國風暴兵|帝國風暴兵]]、以及[[鈦戰機|鈦戰機]]的襲擊。反抗軍們雖然無厘頭但充滿了冒險精神，作為英雄，必須展現他們獨特的天賦及技能，並帶領反抗帝國軍，協助星球裡的住民和平地生活。<ref>{{cite web|publisher=ET today遊戲雲|title=電影經典角色《星際大戰：反抗軍起義》3D動畫引爆話題|url=http://game.ettoday.net/article/425707.htm|date=2014年11月14日|accessdate=2015年10月24日|language=中文|archive-date=2019年5月26日|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526230850/https://game.ettoday.net/article/425707.htm|dead-url=no}}</ref>

|-style="background-color: #FFE4C4"
|colspan=7 align="left"| 固執己見、自我中心、行為古怪的宇宙航修機器人，由於它身上的大部分的零件都是二手的，因此外表看起來格外殘舊，雖然他性情暴躁但它的機智使它成為團隊中不可或缺的角色，平常都協助希娜·仙杜拉打理（Corellian VCX）歌拉利VCX運輸船 - 幽靈號的一切，喜歡對艾斯納和利霸惡作劇，所以艾斯納和利霸常常要好好修理它一頓，但總會是他們兩個被整倒。

 |ShortSummary    = The ''Ghost'' crew steal a shipment of disruptor weapons from Minister Maketh Tua to sell to Vizago, accidentally bringing the Imperially serviced droids [[C-3PO|C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2|R2-D2]] with them in the process. Zeb objects to the mission since the same weapons were used to nearly wipe out his species, the Lasats. On the Ghost Hera is annoyed Kanan has not yet started Ezra's Jedi training. Agent Kallus intercepts C-3PO's distress call and follows the ''Ghost'' to Lothal. Zeb sees that Agent Kallus uses a Bo Rifle, a weapon only used by the Lasat Honour Guard, which Kallus had taken from a Guardsman he killed himself. In the ensuing duel between Zeb and Kallus, Ezra saves Zeb by using [[The_Force_(Star_Wars)|the Force]] for the first time to push Kallus away, allowing the crew to escape after setting the weapons to self-destruct as a diversion. Kanan returns the two droids to their rightful owner [[Bail_Organa|Bail Organa]], who surveys R2-D2's recordings of the rebel crew's actions.

 |ShortSummary    = On the ''Ghost'' Chopper ends up causing a fight between Ezra and Zeb so Hera sends them out on a supply run together to keep them from bickering with each other, specifying that they do not return without a rare meiloorun fruit. The two find that the market's sole supply of meilooruns has been purchased by the Empire. Ezra's attempt to steal the fruit leads to an entanglement against the stormtroopers, forcing Zeb to hijack a [[TIE_fighter|TIE fighter]] for the two to escape in. En route to their rendezvous with the ''Ghost'', the two find farmer Morad Sumar — a friend of Ezra's parents — and his family being arrested over a property dispute with the Empire. Using the TIE fighter to their advantage, Ezra and Zeb are able to rescue Sumar and retrieve the fruit. On their return to the ''Ghost'' after supposedly crashing the fighter Hera is pleased to see Ezra and Zeb are more friendly towards each other. However, a new fight breaks out when Ezra and Zeb realise their fight was Chopper's fault.

 |ShortSummary    = Choppers antics cause Ezra and Zeb to forget to carry out an important repair on Hera's second ship, the ''Phantom''. Hera and Sabine set out to an abandoned Republic asteroid base to retrieve supplies provided by Fulcrum, an anonymous [[informant|informant]] whom Hera has been in contact with. Sabine voices her displeasure towards Hera's secrecy about their mission, feeling as though neither she nor Kanan trust her. Due to the fuel tank leaking on the ''Phantom'', the two are left stranded on the base, which is infested with deadly fyrnocks. The two work together to survive the creatures long enough for the rest of the crew to rescue them aboard the ''Ghost'', allowing Sabine to overcome her trust issues while Hera tells her to have faith in the growing rebellion. Ezra and Zeb promise to properly fix the ''Phantom'' this time.

|ShortSummary    = Kanan tries to teach Ezra how to use the Force to make a connection to other living creatures. The rebels destroy the Empires new prototype TIE Fighter during a parade celebrating the 15th anniversary of the Empire's creation. Ezra, who was born on the same day, is preoccupied with his feelings towards his missing parents and opts out of the mission. He soon discovers that his parents' [[Rodian|Rodian]] friend Tseebo is wanted by the Empire, and rejoins his friends to look for him. Tseebo is found hiding in the basement of Ezra's old house where Ezra reveals his parents were arrested for making anti Empire radio broadcasts, after which Tseebo had gone to work for the Empire. The rebels learn that Tseebo has allowed himself to be implanted with cybernetics so he could steal information that is valuable to the Empire, though the sheer amount of information he uploaded has affected his mind. The Rebels smuggle him off of Lothal aboard the ''Ghost''. During the ensuing chase led by the Inquisitor, Tseebo regains his senses and reveals that he knows what happened to Ezra's parents.

 |ShortSummary    = Learning that Tseebo failed to save his parents from being abducted by the Empire, Ezra lashes out at Tseebo for betraying his parents' trust. Amidst the chase, the Imperials manage to attach a homing beacon on the hull of the ''Phantom'', which Kanan opts to detach from the ''Ghost'' in hyperspace with himself and Ezra on board to mislead the Imperials. The two arrive at Fort Anaxes, where Kanan teaches Ezra to forgive Tseebo by admitting his fear of not knowing what happened to his parents. The two manage to tame the fyrnocks by connecting to them through the Force and set them against the arriving Imperial forces, but are cornered by the Inquisitor who injures Kanan . Overcome with anger, Ezra uses the [[Dark_side_(Star_Wars)|dark side]] of the Force to summon a giant fyrnock against the Inquisitor, allowing the two to escape. Kanan is worried he has not taught Ezra to resist the Dark Side. Back on the ''Ghost'' Sabine gives Ezra a picture of his parents she found in his house. Afterwards, the ''Ghost'' crew take Tseebo to Fulcrum, while Hera offers to relay to Ezra what Tseebo knows of his parents' fate.

 |ShortSummary    = During lightsaber practice Ezra has a fragmented vision of meeting Gall Trayvis, an exiled Imperial senator and rebel sympathizer, and assumes that Trayvis knows about his parents. The rebels receive a transmission from Trayvis notifying them of a secret rally on Lothal, but Ezra receives a tip from Zare Leonis that Kallus is planning to use the senator to lure the rebels into a trap. Following Trayvis's transmission, the rebels find him and save him from Agent Kallus by escaping into Lothal's sewer systems. To Ezra's dismay, Trayvis reveals himself to have been an Imperial spy using his anti Imperial transmissions to identify Rebel sympathisers and claims that Ezra's parents are dead and gone. Having suspected his treachery, Hera outsmarts Trayvis and knocks him out so that the rebels can escape. Although disappointed by the betrayal, Ezra and the other rebels remain hopeful of their cause.

 |ShortSummary    = [[Grand_Moff_Tarkin|Grand Moff Tarkin]] visits Lothal to deal with the Rebels. In light of discovering that Trayvis is actually an Imperial spy, the rebels debate broadcasting a message to the nearby star systems about their cause. Ezra adamantly supports the idea, since his parents had broadcast secret messages from their basement for years. Kanan decides to invade the main Imperial communications tower on Lothal. Tarkin has the Inquisitor execute Commandant Aresko and Taskmaster Lyste for incompetence.  The Rebels think they have the element of surprise, but they do not take into account the arrival of Tarkin, who has deduced where they will strike. The Inquisitor and Kallus are sent out to capture Kanan alive to earn back Tarkin's trust. When the Imperial forces attack the group at the tower, Kanan instructs the team to leave him and thus is captured. The team is able to have Ezra send a message of hope, urging those living under the oppression of the Empire to fight, before Tarkin orders the tower to be destroyed, ending their broadcast.

 |ShortSummary    = On orders to hunt down the Rebels and especially the Jedi among them, Darth Vader begins an oppressive campaign against Lothal's populace in order to find the group. The ''Ghost'' crew starts working with the wider Rebel cells, but are divided between joining the larger network and waging open war on the Empire, or staying out of a large-scale fight. The situation is even more complicated when Minister Maketh Tua, fearing punishment for failing to neutralize the Lothal rebels, tries to defect to them in order to escape Vader, offering to reveal the truth behind why the Emperor wants the planet. However, Vader uses this to his advantage and orchestrates Tua's murder by shuttle explosion, framing the rebels for the act and turning Lothal's population against them. The ''Ghost'' crew tries to flee but are cornered by Vader, who injures Kanan and Sabine and nearly kills Ezra before they finally escape. After being smuggled off-world by Lando Calrissian to escape the Empire, the demoralized crew meet up with Ahsoka's rebel cell, but Vader pursues them and proceeds to wipe out most of the rebel ships, discovering Ahsoka in the process. Ahsoka is horrified to learn that Vader is actually her old Jedi master, Anakin Skywalker. She joins the ''Ghost'' crew as they vow to join the wider fight against the Empire. Darth Vader later reports Ahsoka's existence to Emperor Palpatine, who issues Vader new orders to dispatch another one of their Inquisitors to capture the crew of the ''Ghost''.

Rex gives the Lothal Rebels a datachip containing old Republic bases in the Outer Rim. Ezra tries to persuade the clones to join the Rebellion, but Rex and the clones instead offer to delay the Empire so the Lothal Rebels can escape. Agent Kallus commands the clones to hand over the Rebels, but when Rex refuses, Kallus arrives with three AT-ATs. Taking advantage of a sandstorm and the Force, Kanan, Ezra and the clones use their AT-TE's main gun to destroy one of the AT-ATs. Meanwhile, Admiral Konstantine is summoned away by Darth Vader. Instead of meeting him, the admiral meets Fifth Brother, who claims that he will succeed where Kallus and Konstantine have failed. The Lothal Rebels prepare to leave on the ''Phantom'', but Ezra is unwilling to leave Rex and the clones behind. Kanan, Ezra, and Zeb commandeer one of the AT-ATs and turn its weapons on Kallus' AT-AT which Rex destroys with a critical hit. Kallus flees the battle on a speeder.

 |ShortSummary    = Sabine is sent by Hera to acquire an unknown information courier. She goes with Ezra and Chopper and they find that the courier is a clunky droid. They then encounter Ketsu Onyo, an old "friend" of Sabine's who works as a bounty hunter and is now after the droid. When some Storm Troopers begin to fire at them, Sabine and Chopper steal a ship and go off planet with the droid, unfortunately with Ezra left behind. Ketsu also escapes and after a confrontation with Sabine with her personal ship, captures Chopper and the two meet up to trade the droids. Their activity draws the attention of an Empire ship and the two team up to escape by setting charges on the stolen ship. Sabine is knocked out and almost left to go with the ship, but Ketsu saves her and the explosion allows them to fly the droid to a rebel location and then meet back up with Ezra and Hera before Ketsu leaves on better terms with Sabine.

 |ShortSummary    = Ezra and Commander Sato are captured when a new Imperial weapon—an experimental Interdictor cruiser—generates a gravity well strong enough to pull ships out of hyperspace. Hera sends Kanan, Rex and Chopper to rescue them, using a stolen shuttle, stormtrooper armor, and Rex's knowledge of Imperial codes and protocols to infiltrate the cruiser. Ezra and Chopper head to the reactor to sabotage the cruiser, but Rex is captured as he and Kanan escort Sato and his crew to their shuttle. Kanan heads back to rescue Rex and they deploy an escape pod, as Chopper's sabotage causes the gravity well projectors to overload, pulling the other Imperial cruisers towards the Interdictor and destroying it.

 |ShortSummary    = Ahsoka informs Kanan that she's continuing her investigation on the Sith Lord Darth Vader, but finding information on him is difficult.  In the mean time, she receives word of two sets of coordinates that cross the Imperial net.  She heads to look into one of them while dispatching Kanan, Ezra, Zeb, and Chopper to the other.  Ahsoka arrives at her location first, a ransacked passenger ship adrift in space, and finds signs of weapon damage all over.  The lone survivor, a grandmother, claims "two redblades" kidnapped her grandchild from her and disappeared.  Ahsoka informs the team at their destination on a distant planet that the two Inquisitors are involved.  Zeb and Chopper locate the Inquisitors' fighters at the spaceport and reclaim the baby stored in one before destroying them, while Kanan and Ezra find the distressed mother of the second child.  Chopper takes the first child to the ''Phantom'' shuttle while Zeb encounters the Inquisitors on the street after relieving a fleeing droid of the second baby.  Kanan, Zeb, and Ezra discover that the children are force sensitive and were targeted by the Inquisitors to ensure they do not become Jedi. They attempt to lose the Inquisitors through a housing block on their way back to the shuttle, but are overpowered by them.  Ahsoka appears and easily defeats both of the Inquisitors while the rest escape, using the Force to jump up and join them in the shuttle as it passes overhead.  The Rebels escape, but not before one of Seventh Sister's probe droids hears Ezra saying they're going to the planet Garel.

 |ShortSummary    = Following a tip from Hondo, the ''Ghost'' crew rescues a pair of Lasats from Imperial custody: Chava the Wise and Gron, who both recognize Zeb as Captain of the Lasan Honor Guard. Chava and Gron explain that they are searching for the mythical world of Liresan where the surviving Lasats can find refuge. However, Zeb is reluctant to help due to his guilt over failing to protect Lasan from the Empire. With some encouragement from Ezra, Zeb transforms his Bo-Rifle into its true form and combines it with Chava's staff, revealing Liresan's location in uncharted Wild Space. However, they find their way blocked by a dense cluster of black holes while Agent Kallus pursues them. Trusting in Chava's wisdom, Zeb uses the energy from his Bo-Rifle to create a protective field around the ''Ghost'', allowing it to navigate the black hole cluster safely. On the other side, they find the world of Liresan, which is the true home planet of the Lasats. After dropping off Chava and Gron, Zeb decides to stay on the ''Ghost'' in order to find more Lasat survivors to guide back to Liresan.

 |ShortSummary    = The ''Ghost'' crew is on a mission to capture a fuel shipment from the Mining Guild to the Empire, in order to restock the Rebel fleet's own dwindling supplies. While travelling to the Guild's asteroid refinery, the ''Ghost'' encounters a flock of Purrgil, space-travelling creatures whom Hera considers dangerous. However, Ezra manages to establish contact with them through the Force and learns that his crew and the Purrgil actually pursue the same basic goal, if for slightly differing priorities. Upon reaching the Mining Guild base, the crew finds the Mining Guild attempting to exterminate the Purrgil. Kanan decides to raid the base, steal the shipment, and then destroy the base by igniting the rest of the fuel. However, Ezra stops him as he realizes the Purrgil also need the fuel. When it appears the Mining Guild forces will overwhelm the crew, the Purrgil arrive and attack the Mining Guild, giving the crew the time they need to escape with the fuel. As the ''Ghost'' flies away, the crew witnesses the Purrgil going into hyperspace, confirming the rumor that they are a migratory species.

 |ShortSummary    = In order to provide a safe shelter for their fighters, the Rebels plan to capture an Imperial carrier currently stationed above Ryloth, Hera's home planet. In order to pull the mission off, the ''Ghost'' crew contacts Hera's father, the famed Twi'lek resistance fighter Cham Syndulla. However, Cham desires to destroy the carrier as a demonstration of power, and only grudgingly agrees to capture it. Hera later tells Ezra that she and her father are not on the best of terms, as Hera believes Cham is obsessed with the Twi'lek Resistance while Cham believes Hera's faith in the Rebellion is misguided. Piloting a captured TIE Bomber, Hera successfully infiltrates the crew and Cham's team into the carrier, but Cham's team betrays them and moves to destroy the carrier. Ezra uses a Jedi mind trick on the captain to have the crew abandon ship while Zeb and Sabine subdue Cham's men. Hera manages to convince Cham to help her, and they destroy a pursuing Imperial cruiser, achieving the demonstration Cham wanted. After adding the carrier to the Rebel fleet, Hera and Cham reconcile their relationship before parting ways.

 |ShortSummary    = The ''Ghost'' crew receives a tip about Imperial activity around the planet Geonosis and go to investigate only to find the planet completely devoid of life and evidence of a large weapon having been constructed in orbit. When the crew boards one of the abandoned construction modules, they are ambushed by Agent Kallus. Most of the crew is able to escape back to the ship, but Zeb is forced to take an escape pod. Kallus pursues Zeb into the pod, which gets damaged during their struggle and the pair crash land on one of Geonosis' icy moons. Kallus' leg is injured in the crash, and he and Zeb are forced to work together to survive by fending off hostile monsters and climbing out of the cave they are trapped in. During this, Kallus admits to Zeb that he respects Lasats as warriors, though he has a dislike of them due to his first squad being wiped out by a Lasat. He also reveals he was forced to give the execution orders on Lasan and did not agree with the Empire's decision to exterminate the Lasats. Upon reaching the surface, they activate their emergency transponder. The ''Ghost'' arrives to rescue Zeb shortly after. Kallus wishes to take his chances and wait for Imperial rescue rather than be a Rebel prisoner, and both he and Zeb part ways with a newfound respect for each other. Returning to his Star Destroyer, Kallus is greeted rather coldly, even by Imperial standards, and the episode concludes with him sitting in his quarters, deep in thought.

|ShortSummary    = Ezra and Kanan, after facing off with the Inquisitors again, decide it is not safe for them to be around the Rebels while they are being targeted by the Empire, and decide to get advice from Ahsoka. On her advice, the three set out for the Jedi Temple on Lothal, where each have a separate vision; Ezra, of Master Yoda, Kanan, of the Temple Guard who is testing him, and Ahsoka, of Anakin/Vader. As the Inquisitors track the group to the temple and force their way inside, Ezra is told by Yoda to "find Malachor", Kanan is warned by the Guard, who reveals himself as the former Grand Inquisitor, to beware Ezra's temptation of the Dark Side, dubbing Kanan the official rank of [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]], a rank he was never able to achieve due to the execution of Order 66 and the extermination of the Jedi Order. During her vision, Ahsoka faces her guilt over not being present during the fall of the Jedi, while also accepting the fact that her former master, Anakin Skywalker, has become the Sith Lord Darth Vader. The three escape as the shades of the Temple Guards hold off the Inquisitors. Vader and the Empire's forces arrive at the Temple, as Ahsoka informs Ezra that Malachor is not a person, but a place.

 |ShortSummary    =While on a ''Ghost'' crew mission to steal fuel, Chopper steals a replacement strut for his original leg. Chopper is separated from the ''Ghost'' crew and finds himself stranded on an Imperial freighter. He is eventually discovered by the ship's inventory droid, AP-5, but does not report him upon finding out that Chopper is a veteran of the Clone Wars, just like him. AP-5 complains to Chopper that the Empire does not appreciate his previous role as a strategist, and the freighter crew constantly mistreats him. Chopper removes AP-5's restraining bolt, and the two work together to trap the crew in the cargo hold and detach it from the ship. Chopper makes contact with the ''Ghost'', and AP-5 warns them that the Empire knows their destination and has set up a trap. AP-5 is shot by the freighter captain as he transmits new coordinates, but the ''Ghost'' crew manages to repair him by using parts from the leg Chopper stole.

 |ShortSummary    = After finally finding a planet that is safe from the Empire, the Rebel fleet lands to set up their base. However, one of their scouts goes missing after setting up a sensor beacon. Sabine and Rex go to investigate when they are attacked by a swarm of Krykna spiders. Sabine is rescued by the ''Ghost'' crew, but Rex is captured by the spiders. The crew follows them and rescues Rex, but cannot escape upon finding that the spiders have trapped the ''Ghost'' with a web. Sabine discovers that the spiders cannot go near the sensor beacons they had set up, and uses one to ward them away while the rest of the crew cuts the web and escapes. Back at the base, instead of abandoning the planet, the Rebels use their sensor beacons as a makeshift barrier to keep the spiders away. Ezra, Kanan, and Ashoka decide to head for Malachor to find a way to deal with the Inquisitors.

 |ShortSummary    = Ahsoka, Ezra, Kanan and Chopper arrive on Malachor – a Sith world long forbidden to the Jedi – in search of knowledge, discovering a cavern containing a Sith Temple amid the site of an ancient battlefield between Sith and Jedi who used [[Lightsaber#Types|cross guard lightsabers]]. They soon are attacked by a new Inquisitor, the Eighth Brother, who is hunting a mysterious hermit calling himself "Old Master." When Ezra encounters the hermit, he reveals himself to be [[Darth_Maul|Darth Maul]] and offers to help Ezra get into the Temple, aiding him in recovering a [[Sith_holocron|Sith holocron]].  When the other Inquisitors arrive and alert Darth Vader of their presence, Ezra convinces the group to work together in spite of Kanan's fears that Maul is corrupting his student, allowing them to finally kill the three Inquisitors. However, Maul soon betrays the group and blinds Kanan with his lightsaber, revealing his true intentions of making Ezra his apprentice. Although sightless, Kanan dons the helmet of a fallen Jedi Temple Guard and manages to throw Maul from the top of the temple. Ahsoka finally faces Darth Vader - who has cornered Ezra and destroyed his lightsaber - and comes to terms with his identity as Anakin Skywalker as she engages him in a duel, while Kanan and Ezra remove the Sith Holocron. Unable to abandon her old Master, Ahsoka stays within the crumbling temple and stalls Vader while Ezra, Kanan, and Chopper flee the planet and reunite with the ''Ghost'' crew. Maul fled Malachor while Vader, who survived the destruction of the temple, walks away as a convor watches from above. Ahsoka appears briefly post-battle entering a temple doorway. As the ''Ghost'' crew tries to cope with their losses, Ezra continues to meditate on the Sith Holocron and finally succeeds in opening it.
