芬兰首都赫尔辛基在第二次世界大战期间飽受轟炸。1939–1944年，芬兰遭受了苏联的一系列轰炸活动。最為著名的便是廣為人知的赫尔辛基轰炸。

== 赫尔辛基的防空狀況 ==

1939秋季，赫尔辛基部署了第一支防空部队，拥有三至四門重型高炮，一門輕高炮以及數挺防空機槍。继续战争期间，德国提供了两个预警雷达和四个炮瞄雷达，进一步，18个非常有效的德国重型88毫米防空炮也被放置在赫尔辛基。新的6炮被安置在lauttasaari，KäPYLä和Santahamina。到1944二月，赫尔辛基受13个轻型和重型防空电池的保护。防空系统包括77重型防空炮，41轻型防空炮，36架搜索灯，13个声定位仪，除了视觉观察员6雷达和芬兰海军防空。德国还提供了一些夜间战斗机的支持，包括对苏联的攻击。

防空指挥系统是基于德国的系统，是相当有效的，关键人员在德国进行了培训。由于人手不足，防空也使用了来自Suojeluskunta的16岁志愿者，男孩们负责放空炮，女孩们负责搜索灯。

德国人还驻守了夜间战斗机部队，包括1944年2月12日部署了12个架 BF 109g-6 夜间战机。 德国夜间战斗机对在塔林和赫尔辛基之间的芬兰湾进行巡航。

赫尔辛基的空中防御系统优先阻止到达城市上空的目标。另有一种特殊类型的幕帐攻击，多个电动防空炮进行联合攻击，以使得企图接近的轰炸机减少有效载荷，或更早的返回。这种放空炮弹里使用了美铝混合物；他们燃烧稍慢，并放出白色耀眼的光。

== 苏联远程轰炸团（新增） ==

芬兰大轰炸是一般由苏联空军的远程轰炸和侦察组（VVS），进行的。这一集团直接隶属于苏联高指挥部。在1944年2月的爆炸事件中，加强了其他单位。指挥官是Marshal。轰炸也有时由VVS和BF实施（波罗的海舰队航空集团）。

苏联的轰炸机舰队是非常多样化的。大多数飞机是双引擎飞机，如：Ilyushin-4, Lisunov Li-2, North American B-25 Mitchell and Douglas A-20 bombers。b-25s和 A-20s 是由美国提供给苏联的。Lisunov Li-2 是苏联在American Douglas DC-3上的改装轰炸机版本。也有一些重型四引擎轰炸机参与爆炸行动，例如Pe-8轰炸机。

== 民防系统 ==
在战争之前，赫尔辛基有相当广泛的民事辩护制度。1934年办法了城市法令，高层建筑地下必须构造庇护所。这些只是地下室的加强墙，以抵御附近的炸弹的影响。所有的建筑物都必须有一个指定的民事保护监督员，这个监督员不在储备或军队，因此通常不适合军事服务。这个人的任务是看到，所有的人都在一个有序的时尚的住房。

还有有一些更大的使用坚实的岩石建成的庇护所，但它是不可能，适应所有的赫尔辛基市民。一些医院还配备了地下庇护所，在那里病人可以在空袭中被重新安置。其他人，如儿童医院，被转移到城市外。一家医院完全是地下的，芬兰红十字会大楼。

== 冬日战争 ==
[[File:Valonheitin-haukilahti.jpg|缩略图]]
苏联军队越过边境的三个小时后，著名的冬日战争开始。苏联飞机轰炸了赫尔辛基。最密集的轰炸袭击是在头几天。

在冬季战争期间，赫尔辛基被轰炸了8次。全市有350枚炸弹袭击，造成97人死亡，260人受伤。另有55座建筑物被摧毁。

苏联的轰炸导致了国际的恶劣反应。美国总统罗斯福要求苏联不要轰炸芬兰城市。莫洛托夫回答罗斯福说：“Soviet aircraft have not been bombing cities, but airfields, you can't see that from 8,000 kilometers away in America.”（苏联飞机没有被轰炸的城市，但将不能在美国8000公里外看到机场。）

== 继续战争 ==
由于苏联轰炸机主要集中在 波罗的海 国家的德国军队，赫尔辛基在继续战争中的表现有所比较容易。在继续战争期间，赫尔辛基被轰炸了39次。245人死亡，646人受伤，1944人在三次大袭击中占多数。

=== 1944二月的大突袭 ===
在1944年二月，苏联发动了对赫尔辛基的三次大规模轰炸行动。其目的是粉碎芬兰人的精神和战斗力。这三次袭击分别在二月的6–7日晚上，16-17日晚上，26-27日晚上。Joseph Stalin在1943德黑兰会议上获得了英国和美国对这项措施的支持。以这种方式，USSR希望迫使芬兰断绝与德国的关系，并同意和平解决。

1944年2月的三次突袭中，芬兰防空部队记录到有2121架轰炸机，投放了16000多枚炸弹。在对轰炸机的34200次射击中，有21200个是重型防空炮，12900个是轻型防空炮。

芬兰人为了欺骗苏联空袭者，开除了在城外的岛屿上部署探照灯等方案，从而使得敌机相信那里就是城市。实际上，只有530枚炸弹落在城市中。赫尔辛基的大多数人口已经离开了城市，和其他城市的人员伤亡相当低。

有22-25架苏联轰炸机在空袭中丢失，有18-21架苏联轰炸机被防空炮火摧毁，有4架苏联轰炸机被德国夜间战斗机击落。

==== 第一次重要的突袭：二月6-7日晚 ====

防空指挥系统是基于德国的系统，是相当有效的，关键人员在德国进行了培训。由于人手不足，防空也使用了来自Suojeluskunta的16岁志愿者，男孩们负责放空炮，女孩们负责搜索灯。

第一炸弹落下的时间大约是19:23。大约350枚炸弹落在城市内，约2500枚炸弹落在赫尔辛基以外的地方。总计落下的炸弹（包括落入海里的那些）达6990枚。大约有730架轰炸机参加了袭击。轰炸机有两波：2月6日晚18:51–21:40；2月7日凌晨0:57-4:57。

The defense fired 122 barrages. The light AA artillery fired 2,745 shots and the heavy AA artillery fired 7,719 shots. The Finnish Air Force had no night fighters at this time.

One-hundred persons were killed, and 300 injured. More than 160 buildings were damaged, including the Soviet Embassy. The AA defenses had issued some false alarms the previous days which had lowered people's readiness levels.

德国人还驻守了夜间战斗机部队，包括1944年2月12日部署了12个架 BF 109g-6 夜间战机。 德国夜间战斗机对在塔林和赫尔辛基之间的芬兰湾进行巡航。

==== The second great raid: 16–17 February ====
Since Tallinn had been bombed heavily and intelligence pointed out that a raid might be directed at Helsinki, the Helsinki air defense took some active measures.

After the first raid, a German night fighter group of 12 [[Bf_109戰鬥機|Messerschmitt Bf 109G-6]] fighters with special night fighting equipment was transferred to the [[赫尔辛基-马尔米机场|Helsinki-Malmi Airport]] from the Estonian front. These managed to shoot down six bombers during the following two raids. The anti-aircraft batteries fired 184 barrages and downed two bombers. Heavy AA batteries fired 12,238 shots and light AA batteries fired 5,709 shots.

Most of the population of Helsinki had voluntarily evacuated to the countryside and the remainder were prepared to take shelter at first warning. This reduced casualties significantly.

This time 383 bombers participated. While 4,317 bombs fell on the city, the sea and in the surrounding area, only 100 bombs fell within the city. The warning was sounded at 20:12 and the bombers approached again in two waves: 20:12–23:10 on 16 February and 23:45–05:49 on 17 February. The first wave tried to concentrate the bombing by approaching from different directions. In the second wave, the aircraft came in smaller groups from the east. Finnish intelligence had intercepted messages one hour and 40 minutes before the raid and warned the air defense, which had time to prepare. The air defense sounded the warning 49 minutes before the raid. Radar picked up the first aircraft 34 minutes before the beginning of the bombings.

This time casualty figures were much lower: 25 died and 29 were injured. 27 buildings were destroyed and 53 were damaged.

==== The third great raid: 26–27 February ====

On the evening of 26 February, a single Soviet reconnaissance aircraft was spotted over the city. It was a sign of the coming attack. The weather was clear, which helped the attackers. Again Finnish Radio Intelligence intercepted messages of the forthcoming raid, this time 1 hour and 28 minutes before the bombing would commence—although the Soviets tried to maintain radio silence.

Five minutes later, the air surveillance grid, manned by Lotta Svärd auxiliaries, reported approaching bombers. A silent alarm was sounded in the city in good time before the raid. Street lights were turned off, trams and trains were stopped and radio transmissions ended. In this manner, the enemy had more difficulty finding their target. All citizens knew that they had to take cover.

The first bombers were picked up by Finnish radar at approximately 18:30, 25 minutes before they would arrive. A few minutes later, the night fighters took off and flew to their predesignated positions. The AA-artillery had also been alerted. The air raid warning was sounded at 18:45. AA-batteries opened up fire at 18:53. At 19:07 the first bombs fell.

苏联的轰炸机舰队是非常多样化的。大多数飞机是双引擎飞机，如：Ilyushin-4, Lisunov Li-2, North American B-25 Mitchell and Douglas A-20 bombers。b-25s和 A-20s 是由美国提供给苏联的。Lisunov Li-2 是苏联在American Douglas DC-3上的改装轰炸机版本。也有一些重型四引擎轰炸机参与爆炸行动，例如Pe-8轰炸机。

This last great raid differed from the two previous ones. The battle lasted for some 11 hours and was divided into three different phases. The first one was in the evening and lasted for four hours and concentrated the attacks against the city. The second one was mainly focused on the defending AA artillery, but to little success. The last wave hoped to finally flatten the city, but the majority of the aircraft turned away when met with fierce anti-aircraft barrages and night fighters. The all clear signal was finally sounded at about 6:30 in the morning of 27 February.

Despite that this had been the most massive raid, the damages were again quite limited: 21 people were killed and 35 wounded; 59 buildings were destroyed and 135 damaged.

The heavy AA artillery fired 14,240 shots and the light AA artillery 4,432 shots. Nine Soviet bombers were downed.

This time 896 bombers participated in the raid on Helsinki. They dropped 5,182 bombs of which only 290 fell on the city itself.

=== The damage of the great raids ===
Of the European cities that suffered bombing raids during the Second World War, Helsinki fared better than most thanks to the efficiency of the anti-aircraft and deception measures. Only 5% of the bombs fell within the city, and some of these fell in uninhabited park areas causing no damage. Some 2,000 bombers participated in the three great raids on the city and dropped some 2,600 tons of bombs. Of the 146 who died, six were soldiers; 356 were wounded. 109 buildings were destroyed. 300 were damaged by shrapnel and 111 were set on fire. The Soviets lost 25 aircraft.

After the war, the Allied Control Commission led by Soviet General [[安德烈·亞歷山德羅維奇·日丹諾夫|Andrei Zhdanov]] came to in Helsinki. Zhdanov was perplexed by the limited damage the city had sustained.<ref>Bruun, Staffan: [http://hbl.fi/feature/2014-02-02/562831/natten-nar-helsingfors-skulle-forintas Natten när Helsingfors skulle förintas.]</ref>The Soviet leadership thought that they had destroyed the city completely and that it was these bombings that had forced the Finns to the peace table.

=== Finnish response ===
The Finnish Air Force responded to the air raids with series of night infiltration bombings of ADD airfields near to Leningrad. Finnish bombers – Junkers Ju 88s, Bristol Blenheims, and Dornier Do 17s - either tailed or in some cases even joined formation with returning Soviet bombers over the Gulf of Finland and followed these to their bases. Once most Soviet bombers had landed the Finnish bombers approached to bomb both the landed and still landing Soviet bombers and then escaped in the ensuing confusion. The first major night infiltration bombing took place on 9 March 1944 and they lasted until May 1944. Soviet casualties from these raids could not be estimated reliably.<ref><cite class="citation web">Jukka O. Kauppinen; Matti Rönkkö (2006-02-27). </cite></ref>

还有有一些更大的使用坚实的岩石建成的庇护所，但它是不可能，适应所有的赫尔辛基市民。一些医院还配备了地下庇护所，在那里病人可以在空袭中被重新安置。其他人，如儿童医院，被转移到城市外。一家医院完全是地下的，芬兰红十字会大楼。
