== 維吉尼亞理工大學慘案 ==
{{Main|2007年維吉尼亞理工大學校園槍擊案}}

據[[美國|美國]][[CNN|CNN電視臺]]報導， 趙承熙於4月16日事發當天曾在宿舍內與兩人發生嚴重爭吵，其間說出「[[太子黨|富家子弟]]」、「[[放蕩|放蕩]]」、「[[欺詐|欺詐]]」等字眼，隨後宿舍內傳出槍聲，兩人身亡。

兩小時後，趙承熙闖入[[維吉尼亞理工大學|維吉尼亞理工大學]]工程系諾理斯教學大樓開槍，造成32人死亡，23人受傷。警方根據從兩支槍上採集的[[指紋|指紋]]與移民案卷認定了兇手[[身分|身分]]。並在兩處[[大樓|大樓]]內採集到[[指紋|指紋]]核對並證實吻合。警方一度怀疑与兇手[[手臂|手臂]]上之紅墨水印記「{{tsl|en|Ismail Ax|Ismail Ax}}」同名的[[同案犯|同犯]]或[[證人|證人]]，但后来证明确实仅有一名兇手。

後來趙承熙被警方包圍於大樓內，兇徒吞槍自殺，脑部中彈。[[維吉尼亞州|弗州]][[警方|警方]]已根据证人供词认定他是此次事件中仅有的「[[縱慾殺手|縱慾殺手]]」（英文：Rampage killer 或 Spree killer）。

== 槍械來源 ==
根據[[美國憲法|美國憲法]][[美國憲法第二修正案|第二修正案]]條文，美國民眾不可剝奪的有擁槍、持槍的權利。每個擁有[[持槍證|持槍證]]的[[弗吉尼亚州|弗吉尼亚州]]州民均能在本州內方便合法地購買槍支。根據槍械店記錄，赵於2007年3月6日購入一款[[格洛克19|格洛克19]][[9毫米魯格彈|九毫米口径]][[手槍|手槍]]，4月9日又增購一款[[卡尔·瓦尔特运动枪有限公司|瓦爾特]][[瓦爾特P22半自動手槍|P22]][[.22_LR|.22 LR]]（點二二[[英吋|英吋]]）小口徑[[手槍|手槍]]。兩支槍上的序號均被[[銼刀|銼刀]]磨去。

[[美國聯邦調查局|美國聯邦調查局]]相信，兩支[[手槍|手槍]]及[[子彈|槍彈]]均是通過合法途徑，於弗吉尼亚的槍店中購買，根據該州法律，州民每個月只能購槍一枝（或一挺）。

Fellow students described Cho as a "quiet" person who "would not respond if someone greeted him." Student Julie Poole said that on the first day of a literature class last year the students introduced themselves one by one, but when it was Cho's turn, he did not speak.

===医院的评价===
2005年，赵承熙曾被[[弗吉尼亚州|弗吉尼亚州]][[蒙哥马利县|蒙哥马利县]]当局短期羁留并接受心理评估，评估结果为他理智不健全、已构成对其本人的生命威胁。特别法官命令赵到县医院心理科门诊接受诊治，赵也遵照就医，随后的[[医生|医生]]检查发现赵患有严重的[[忧郁症|忧郁症]]。另有一些报导是在案发前赵使用抗忧郁[[药物|药物]]，但是经[[联邦调查局|联邦调查局]]查对全美国[[药物|药物]][[数据库|数据库]]并没有找到任何医生给赵的开的处方记录。

===大学的评价===
理工大学的发言人称赵承熙是个‘不合群的人’，并说大学为找关于他的资讯费了很大劲。大学裡有一个韩国学生俱乐部，但俱乐部主任说赵从来不与韩国同学们交谈。早些时候有人报告赵在[[宿舍|宿舍]]内放火，两名女生报告[[警方|警方]]说在校园中被赵[[跟踪|跟踪]]，他的同班女同学报告说他曾用手机[[偷拍|偷拍]]她们的照片。

===同学的评价=== 
另有同学描述赵为‘沉默寡言’的人，别人给他打招呼他却从不理睬。女同学朱莉·普尔（Julie Poole）说上[[文学|文学课]]第一天每个同学都自我介绍，当轮到他时却坐着发愣，一句话也没有说。老师从同学们上课前的[[签名|签名表]]上他的栏目中仅看见一个[[问号|问号]]，从此他就被视作‘问号小子’（Question mark kid）。赵的祖母也说，我孙儿非常內向，我真的不相信他会做出这么大的事情来。

John declined to describe Cho as "mean", conflicting with another first-hand account.

Stephanie Derry, a fellow student, said Cho never participated in class discussions.  "He was just there, I can't even describe it. He would just sit and watch us, but wouldn't say anything. It was his lack of behavior that really set him apart. He basically just kept to himself, very isolated. I remember only once he smiled, but it wasn't very big."<ref name=collegemedia>[http://collegemedia.com/ Cho's classroom colleague reacts to tragedy] The Collegiate Times. Accessed 4-17-2007 </ref> -->两名曾经与赵同过宿舍的学生在被访谈时说，赵的确有跟踪男同学的异性朋友，有时深夜站在自己寝室门口给路过的同学拍照，又时常打骚扰电话给同学说：‘我是小赵的哥哥，问号’。他也经常对感兴趣的女生介绍他自己是‘问号’。<!-- 同宿舍的同学也证实了赵曾有跟踪同学的异性朋友。-->

同学史蒂芬尼·戴莉（Stephanie Derry）说赵从不参加课堂讨论，她说：‘他只是坐在那里而已，我都不能形容了，光坐在那里看我们讨论，自己一句话都不说。正是他的缺乏表现的行为才使他显得与众不同，我仅记得他笑过一次，且不是大笑’。

===老师的评价===
<!-- Lucinda Roy, one of Cho's English professors, described Cho as "an intelligent man" but seemed to be an awkward and very lonely and insecure man who never took off his sunglasses, even indoors.

In the package contained videos and photos of himself, and written texts explaining his reasons for his actions.-->因为赵把地址中的[[美國郵區編號|美國郵區編號]]写错了，邮包在路上多走了一天。

4月18日，NBC收到邮包，光碟中有27段[[录像|录影]]短片（均存档为[[苹果电脑|苹果电脑]]的[[QuickTime|QT电影格式]]），当晚NBC播放其中一部分录影。赵於开场白中如此说道：<!--Cho says on one of the videos he sent to NBC:-->
{{cquote|我并不一定要这样做，我大可以一走了之，逃到天涯海角。但是不，我再也不逃了！我这样做不是为我自己，而是为了我的孩子和兄弟姐妹们（注：指广义上的，不是指他的直系亲属），他们已经被你们蹂躪过了，我为了他们。我在那个时候，做了我該做的事。你们有成百亿个机会避免今日之事发生，但是你们却决定要洒我的血。是你们把我逼到了墙角，只留给我一个选择。既然决定是你们做的，现在你们的手上就沾上了永远洗不掉的血。<!--I didn’t have to do this. I could have left. I could have fled. But no, I will no longer run. It’s not for me. For my children, for my brothers and sisters that you fucked, I did it for them… When the time came, I did it. I had to.--><ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18169776 Gunman sent package to NBC News]</ref>
}}

这段话除了最后一句，全部使用英语的[[过去时态|过去时态]]，因为他知道当人们看到时他已经不再活在世上了。

<!--The "multimedia manifesto", as it was referred to by MSNBC, also consisted of several pages of less coherent text. MSNBC justice correspondent Pete Williams stated that it lacked logical governance, suggesting he was under severe emotional distress. The text railed against people of wealth, and [[hedonism|hedonism]]. In one of the videos, Cho compares himself to [[Jesus_Christ|Jesus Christ]], explaining that his death will influence generations of people.-->另外据专家分析{{請求來源}}，他所留下的数页文字毫无[[逻辑性|逻辑性]]，让人摸不着头脑。可以看出这个人的精神已经濒临崩溃。文字大致是咒骂拥有过多财富的美国人们，和享乐主义（即挥金如土）的生活方式。在以下一段[[录影|录影]]中，赵还说道：

{{cquote|多亏了你们，我今日死如耶稣基督，让我的行动激励每一代中那些弱势的人，那些无力自卫的人。<!--Thanks to you, I die like Jesus Christ, to inspire generations of the weak and the defenseless people.-->}}

<!--The videos along with the photos of him holding a knife to his throat and a gun to his head, reveal that Cho was planning on killing himself at the end of his killing spree.

-->在另一段文字中赵还特意提到了1999年4月20日发生在[[科罗拉多州|科罗拉多州]][[丹佛市|丹佛市]]的[[科倫拜校園事件|科倫拜校園事件]]和其中两名少年凶犯，值得注意的是本事件发生日距离那次惨案为八年差四日整。<!--One of the documents referenced the Columbine killers, [[Eric_Harris_and_Dylan_Klebold|Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]]. The massacre occured on April 16 (four days before the eighth anniversary of the [[Columbine_High_School_massacre|Columbine shooting]]).<ref>[http://video.msn.com/v/us/msnbc.htm?f=00&g=925bc281-ce20-439e-9682-8cc58066b2bf&p=hotvideo_m_vatech&t=c3556&rf=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18169776/&fg= 'Multimedia manifesto' sent to NBC News] - video clips</ref>

The manifesto also mentions teacher and accused possessor of child pornography [[John_Mark_Karr|John Mark Karr]]: -->

在录影的末尾和打印出来的相片之中有他用军用刀抵着自己咽喉和用手枪比划着自己的[[太阳穴|太阳穴]]的骇人镜头，即说明他是要人们看到，他将要在按预定计划实现了他蓄谋已久的『[[縱慾殺手|縱慾杀戮]]』之后自尽。

==英语习作==
===两个短剧本===
2006年，赵承熙曾用[[英语|英语]]写下一个[[剧本|剧本]]习作，标题为《理查德·麦克必夫纪事》（''Richard McBeef''）。标题里的人名可能袭自[[莎士比亚|莎翁]]的名作《[[麦克白|马可白]]》（''Macbeth''）。和《马》剧类似，剧本是讲一个十三岁小孩约翰設計並陷害[[继父|继父]]，使得繼父被母親誤會, 導致家庭失和的虚构故事。剧中有一段在小约翰、继父理查德、和生母苏珊之间剧烈争吵的‘戏肉’，在本剧结尾则是继父在惱羞成怒之下给了小约翰‘致命的一击’。

后来，赵又写了一个短剧，标题为《布朗斯通先生》（或译《布朗史东先生》），情节为三个十七岁少年一边在[[赌场|赌场]]试运气，一边谈论他们所憎恨的数学老师即布朗斯通先生，因为老师曾虐待（在英文劇本裏趙寫做‘雞姦’，趙的用詞為ass-rape)過他们三个人，最后三人赢了一些钱，布朗斯通先生却出现，经过一番唇槍舌戰后居然把他们的钱都骗走了。<!--In [[2006|2006]], Cho wrote a short, profanity-laden one-act play entitled "Richard McBeef", an obvious reference to [[Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s [[Macbeth|Macbeth]]. It is about a 13-year-old boy, John, who accuses his stepfather, Richard McBeef, of [[molest|molest]]ing him and murdering his father. John repeatedly says he will kill Richard. John, Richard, and Sue, John's mother, become involved in a major argument. The play ends with Richard, who up until this point is passive, dealing John "a deadly blow".<ref>[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0417071vtech1.html "Richard McBeef" script posted at The Smoking Gun]  Accessed 4-17-2007 </ref>

In a second play attributed to Cho, titled "[[Mr._Brownstone|Mr. Brownstone]]", three 17-year-olds named John, Jane, and Joe are gambling at a [[casino|casino]] while discussing their deep hatred of their 45-year-old mathematics teacher, Mr. Brownstone, who they claim raped them. Brownstone appears and, amid volleys of profanity, cheats them out of their casino winnings.<ref name="AOL-McBeef">[http://news.aol.com/virginia-tech-shootings/cho-seung-hui/_a/richard-mcbeef-title-page/20070417141309990001 "Mr. Brownstone" script posted at AOL]  Accessed April 17, 2007.</ref><ref name="MSNBC-McB">[[MSNBC|MSNBC]] News announcement at 3:45 pm ET April 17, 2007; transcript not yet available.</ref>-->

===对剧本的评价===
[[戏剧学|戏剧学]][[教授|教授]]爱德华·法乐科（Edward Falco 或译爱华特·科高）曾在[[课堂|课堂]]上评述过赵的其中一个[[剧本|短剧本]]，他首先提到在短短的十二页中发现一些[[语法|语法]]和键盘敲击错误。法乐科教授相信赵是因为与众人口头沟通不擅才付诸纸上的。他说：‘[[剧本|剧本]]写的不算好，但起码那也是一种沟通方式’。

另一位教授则说赵的作品「如同儿戏」，而且含有大量[[暴力|暴力]]成分。他的同学们则认为那个[[剧本|剧本]]实在是[[病态|病态]]、[[畸形|畸形]]。前同班同学麦克法兰（Ian MacFarlane，在世幸存着）说：「我们看过他的剧本后，简直就像作了一场恶梦，[[暴力|暴力]]情节那么扭曲，那么恐怖，一般人怎么想像得出。」<!--[[Edward_Falco|Edward Falco]], a playwriting professor at Virginia Tech, has acknowledged that Cho wrote both plays in his class.  The plays are less than 12 pages long and contain a number of grammatical and typographical errors. Falco believed that Cho was drawn to writing because of his difficulty in communicating verbally.  Falco said of the plays, "They're not good writing, but at least they are a form of communication."<ref>{{cite news |first=Jonathan |last=Mandell |title='Cho's Professor to Classmates: Don't Feel Guilty"|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/18/vatech.professor/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=[[2007-04-18|2007-04-18]] |accessdate=2007-04-18}}</ref>

Another professor who taught Cho characterized his work as "very adolescent" and "silly", with attempts at "[[Slapstick|slapstick comedy]]" and "elements of violence."<ref>{{cite news |first=Wingert |last=Pat |coauthors=Lynn Waddell and Arian Campo-Flores |title='He Was Just Off' |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18161472/site/newsweek/ |publisher=Newsweek |date=[[2007-04-17|2007-04-17]] |accessdate=2007-04-17}}</ref>

Classmates believed  "the plays, were really morbid and grotesque."<ref name=collegemedia/>  Former classmate, Ian MacFarlane stated, "When we read Cho's plays, it was like something out of a nightmare. The plays had really twisted, macabre violence that used weapons I wouldn't have even thought of."<ref name="Dark writing led to a referral for counseling for Va. Tech gunman">{{cite web

赵承熙的暴行极大震撼了美国的[[韓裔美國人|韩裔社区]]，当年约九万三千名有[[韓國|韓國]]背景的学生在美国各[[高等院校|高等院校]]中读书。

[[首尔|首尔]]一位市民愤慨地说：「他的父母含辛茹苦把他带到美国养大，又读上了[[大学|大学]]，没想到他却幹出这么疯狂的事情来」。多数在美韩人都担心[[主流社区|主流社区]]会因此对他们产生更多[[种族偏见|种族偏见]]并多生事端。

很多在美的韩国人在事件发生后便马上前去对[[幸存者|幸存者]]表示了慰问和支持。[[大韩民国总统|大韩民国总统]][[卢武鉉|卢武鉉]]宣称该事件之震撼「简直不可思议」，令他「深感痛楚」。
