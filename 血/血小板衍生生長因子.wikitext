'''血小板衍生生長因子'''（Platelet-derived growth factor，PDGF）為一種[[生長因子|生長因子]]，可以調控[[細胞|細胞]]的生長和分化，且在[[血管新生|血管新生]]上扮演重要角色。未控制的血管新生常常導致癌症。在化學上PDGF為[[醣蛋白|醣蛋白]][[蛋白二聚體|二聚體]]，且有A和B兩種不同形式，可組合為AA、AB和BB等結構。

PDGF擁有五種{{le|亞型|isoform}}

{{TransH}}
There are five different [[isoform|isoform]]s of PDGF that activate cellular response through two different [[受体_(生物化学)|receptors]]. Known [[配體|ligand]]s include A (''[[PDGFA|PDGFA]]''), B (''[[PDGFB|PDGFB]]''), C (''[[PDGFC|PDGFC]]''), and D (''[[PDGFD|PDGFD]]''), and an AB hetero[[蛋白二聚体|dimer]] and receptors alpha (''[[PDGFRA|PDGFRA]]'') and beta (''[[PDGFRB|PDGFRB]]''). PDGF has few other members of the family, for example [[血管内皮生长因子|VEGF sub-family]].

The [[受体_(生物化学)|receptor]] for PDGF, '''PDGFR''' is classified as a [[receptor_tyrosine_kinase|receptor tyrosine kinase]] (RTK), a type of [[细胞膜|cell surface]] receptor.

The different ligand isoforms have variable affinities for the receptor isoforms, and the receptor isoforms may variably form hetero- or homo- dimers.  This leads to specificity of downstream signaling.  It has been shown that the ''sis'' [[癌基因|oncogene]] is derived from the PDGF B-chain [[基因|gene]]. PDGF-BB is the highest-affinity ligand for the PDGFR-beta; PDGFR-beta is a key marker of hepatic stellate cell activation in the process of [[纤维化|fibrogenesis]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}

PDGFs are mitogenic during early developmental stages, driving the proliferation of undifferentiated [[间充质|mesenchyme]] and some [[progenitor|progenitor]] populations. During later maturation stages, PDGF signalling has been implicated in tissue remodelling and cellular differentiation, and in inductive events involved in patterning and morphogenesis. In addition to driving mesenchymal proliferation, PDGFs have been shown to direct the migration, differentiation and function of a variety of specialised mesenchymal and migratory cell types, both during development and in the adult animal.<ref name="PUB00014075">{{cite journal | author = Hoch RV, Soriano P | title = Roles of PDGF in animal development | journal = Development | volume = 130 | issue = 20 | pages = 4769–4784 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12952899 | doi = 10.1242/dev.00721 }}</ref> Other growth factors in this family include vascular endothelial growth factors B and C (VEGF-B, VEGF-C)<ref name="PUB00004886">{{cite journal | author = Olofsson B, Pajusola K, Kaipainen A, von Euler G, Joukov V, Saksela O, Orpana A, Pettersson RF, Alitalo K, Eriksson U | title = Vascular endothelial growth factor B, a novel growth factor for endothelial cells | journal = Proc.

In terms of osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells, comparing PDGF to epidermal growth factor (EGF), which is also implicated in stimulating cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation,<ref name="Kratchmarova, I 2005" /> MSCs were shown to have stronger osteogenic differentiation into bone-forming cells when stimulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF) versus PDGF.  However, comparing the signaling pathways between them reveals that the PI3K pathway is exclusively activated by PDGF, with EGF having no effect. Chemically inhibiting the PI3K pathway in PDGF-stimulated cells negates the differential effect between the two growth factors, and actually gives PDGF an edge in osteogenic differentiation.<ref name="Kratchmarova, I 2005">{{cite journal | author = Kratchmarova I, Blagoev B, Haack-Sorensen M, Kassem M, Mann M | title = Mechanism of divergent growth factor effects in mesenchymal stem cell differentiation | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5727 | pages = 1472–7 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15933201 | doi = 10.1126/science.1107627 }}</ref> [[Wortmannin|Wortmannin]] is a PI3K-specific inhibitor, and treatment of cells with Wortmannin in combination with PDGF resulted in enhanced osteoblast differentiation compared to just PDGF alone, as well as compared to EGF.<ref name="Kratchmarova, I 2005"/> These results indicate that the addition of Wortmannin can significantly increase the response of cells into an osteogenic lineage in the presence of PDGF, and thus might reduce the need for higher concentrations of PDGF or other growth factors, making PDGF a more viable growth factor for osteogenic differentiation than other, more expensive growth factors currently used in the field such as BMP2.<ref>Hayashi, A.
