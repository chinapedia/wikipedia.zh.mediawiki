<!--==劇情==
Princess Bubblegum and Lady Rainicorn investigate a mysterious black ice cave, fearing that Finn and Jake may have been captured by the Ice King on a routine expedition. Once inside the cave, Lady and Bubblegum enter into a biologically-engineered dungeon and are attacked by mysterious hand-like creatures that attempt to grab them. Lady manages to phase through a wall, and the two hear the Ice King's voice coming from a [[ventilation_shaft|ventilation shaft]]. Inside the shaft, the two are attacked by a giant tongue before they enter into a room covered with eyes. As Bubblegum and Lady approach the room's exit, the eyes activate and shoot laser at the duo, incapacitating Lady.

Bubblegum plods on in the dark, carrying an unconscious Lady around her shoulders. Suddenly, she stumbles upon the [[disembowel|disembowel]]ed body of the oblivious Ice King. From the dark, Ricardio, the living heart of the Ice King, introduces himself, tossing an unconscious Finn and Jake into the light. Ricardio reveals that he built himself both a body as well as the dungeon complex in an attempt to impress Bubblegum. He reveals that he wishes to marry her; Bubblegum agrees to marry Ricardio if he can beat her in [[hand-to-hand_combat|hand-to-hand combat]]. After a short fight, Bubblegum disarms Ricardio and forces him to flee, wounded, into the darkness. Later, at the Candy Kingdom, Finn, Jake, the Ice King, and Lady recover, and Lady reveals to Jake that she is pregnant.

"Ricardio the Heart Guy" was storyboarded by [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]] and Cole Sanchez, from a story by Patrick McHale, [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], and [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]]. It was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]]. The episode features the recurring villain Ricardio, played by [[George_Takei|George Takei]], a character that [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]] later called "the valentine from Hell".<ref name=pollylou>Kenny, Tom (Actor). 2012.

The episode reveals that Lady Rainicorn is pregnant with Jake's children. This plot point would later be brought to the forefront in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_5)|fifth season]] episode "Jake the Dad".<ref name=ladynpeebs/><ref name=jakethedad>{{cite web|last=Sava|first=Oliver|title='Jake the Dad' {{!}} Adventure Time {{!}} TV Club|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/jake-the-dad,90342/|work=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

Sugar felt that Bubblegum, in the episode, was the victim of sexual harassment by Ricardio, and that the only way for her to solve the problem was for her to turn the situation around. In the episode, this was metaphorically depicted by having Bubblegum best Ricardio in combat. Sugar reveled in the fact that she got to draw Bubblegum ripping off Ricardio's leg and beating him with; she noted that she had been wanting to featuring such a scene in her art since she was in high school. The climactic scene with Ricardio was also supposed to have featured more body imagery. Ricardio was originally slated to have been seated on a giant hand-throne, and the hole in the Ice King's chest was to have been more graphic.<ref name=sugarlady/>

Several video games inspired elements of the episode. Ricardio's bioengineered body was based on the finale incarnation of [[Majora_(The_Legend_of_Zelda)#Majora|Majora]], a character from the eponymous 2000 video game ''[[The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora's_Mask|The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask]]''.  The general look of Ricardio's dungeon was inspired by the 2002 video games ''[[Eternal_Darkness:_Sanity's_Requiem|Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem]]'' and the 2010 game ''[[Amnesia:_The_Dark_Descent|Amnesia: The Dark Descent]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones-Quartey|first=Ian|title=Was Ricardio's Body based on Majora's Incarnation from The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask?|url=http://spring.me/ianjq/q/362749630183666983|accessdate=September 27, 2013|date=August 22, 2012|publisher=[[Formspring|Formspring]]}}</ref> [[Robert_Ryan_Cory|Robert Ryan Cory]], a character designer most known for his work on the [[Nickelodeon|Nickelodeon]] series ''[[SpongeBob_Squarepants|SpongeBob Squarepants]]'', storyboarded the panels featuring Princess Bubblegum stomping on Ricardio and grinding her foot into his face. Because he drew the panels, lead character designer Andy Ristaino also allowed Cory to finalize the character designs for the scene. He later posted them on his official [[Flickr|Flickr]] account.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cory|first=Robert Ryan|title=Adventure Time Ricardio Stomp|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/robertryancory/7826319542/|publisher=[[Flickr|Flickr]]|accessdate=August 27, 2013|date=August 20, 2012}}</ref>
