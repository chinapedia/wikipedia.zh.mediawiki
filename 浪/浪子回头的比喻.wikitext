17　'''他醒悟过来'''，就说，我父亲有多少的雇工，口粮有余，我倒在这里饿死吗？<br />
18　我要起来，到我父亲那里去，向他说，父亲，我得罪了天，又得罪了你。<br />
19　从今以后，我不配称为你的儿子，把我当作一个雇工吧。<br />

21　儿子说，父亲，我得罪了天，又得罪了你，从今以后，我不配称为你的儿子。<br />
22　父亲却吩咐仆人说，把那上好的袍子快拿出来给他穿。把戒指戴在他指头上。把鞋穿在他脚上。<br />
23　把那肥牛犊牵来宰了，我们可以吃喝快乐。<br />
24　'''因为我这个儿子，是死而复活，失而又得的。他们就快乐起来。'''<br />
25　那时，大儿子正在田里。他回来离家不远，听见作乐跳舞的声音。<br />
26　便叫过一个仆人来，问是什么事。<br />
27　仆人说，你兄弟来了。你父亲，因为得他无灾无病地回来，把肥牛犊宰了。<br />
28　大儿子却生气，不肯进去。他父亲就出来劝他。<br />
29　他对父亲说，我服事你这多年，从来没有违背过你的命。你并没有给我一只山羊羔，叫我和朋友，一同快乐。<br />
30　但你这个儿子，和娼妓吞尽了你的产业，他一来了，你倒为他宰了肥牛犊。<br />
31　父亲对他说，儿阿，你常和我同在，我一切所有的，都是你的。<br />
32　可是你弟弟是死而复活、失而又得的，所以我们应该欢喜快乐。<br />

== 故事 ==
耶稣说，一个人有两个儿子，小儿子要求父亲把归他的那一分家产给他，然后起身往远方去，在那里将分给他的财产挥霍一空，只能屈辱地去为人放猪为生。这时他决定回家，请求父亲的原谅。但是当他回家时，他的父亲在远处看见，就动了慈心，几乎不给他机会来表示悔改，就跑去抱着他的颈项，热切的与他亲嘴，并宰了肥牛犊庆祝小儿子的回来，又把上好的袍子给他穿，把戒指戴在他手上，把鞋穿在他脚上。大儿子听见，对无耻的小儿子受到这样的优待，而自己一直忠诚却未受过奖赏，感到生气嫉妒。他父亲就出来劝他：孩子，你始终和我同在，我一切所有的都是你的。只是你这个兄弟是死而复活，失而又得的，所以我们理当欢喜快乐。

<!-- Although the story is traditionally referred to as "The Prodigal Son", this title is not found in the gospel, and commentators such as [[I._Howard_Marshall|I. Howard Marshall]] call it "The Lost Son", showing its parallels to the parables of the "Lost Sheep" and "Lost Coin" which immediately precede it in Luke 15. In all three, the theme is the concern of God for the repenting sinner, as opposed to strictly for the unfailingly righteous.{{fact|date=March 2007}} Indeed, many people with no other acquaintance with the word [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Prodigal "prodigal"] mistakenly believe it means ''lost''; it actually means ''extravagant'' (as in [[Charles_Darwin|Darwin]]'s description of nature as "prodigal in variety, though [[Niggardly|niggard]] in innovation"). In fact, in most other languages, the story is indeed called "The Lost Son". Others have argued that the parable might be better called the story of "The Two Sons", to emphasise the role of the elder son, and the lesson against envy and low-mindedness that it contains.{{fact|date=March 2007}} (Indeed, the focus of the story appears{{Fact|date=March 2007}} to be on the reaction of the older son against his brother whom he calls "thy son" rather than "my brother" when addressing his father). -->

<!-- The story is one of several very well-known parables of Jesus that are only found in Luke's gospel; and like the others, it expresses Luke's distinctive [[theology|theology]] of the inclusive love and [[divine_grace|grace]] of God.{{fact|date=March 2007}}  The [[forgiveness|forgiveness]] of the son is not conditional on good works, since he has plainly done nothing "good" throughout the story, other than to return home, symbolic of [[repentance|repentance]];{{fact|date=March 2007}} and although he formulates the intention of admitting his guilt to his father, his father accepts him even before he gets the chance to carry his intention out, although he indeed makes his prepared speech of confession in the end.  Some teachers  
interpret this story to mean that, when one comes to God, they should come with the intention to serve Him ("make me as one of your hired servants") rather than to make demands.  Most Christian theologians note that the story demonstrates repentance:{{fact|date=March 2007}} Jesus is suggesting that the recognition by the returning son that he had erred, and his demonstration by his return that he now recognized the error of his ways, was the key to him receiving the father's forgiveness.  The correct understanding{{fact|date=March 2007}} of repentance as it is used in the New Testament (and, indeed, in the [[Hebrew_Bible|Hebrew Bible]]) is a change in the direction of one's life—which the Prodigal Son literally demonstrates. The father's words to his oldest son, "All that I have is thine," (verse 31) suggest that the oldest son's jealousy was not only petty, but misplaced; his steadfast obedience will be justly rewarded. -->

<!-- [[教宗|教宗]][[若望·保禄二世|若望·保禄二世]] explored the issues raised by this parable in his second encyclical [[Dives_in_Misericordia|Dives in Misericordia]] (Latin for "Rich in Mercy") issued in 1980.

== The dual challenge to the Publicans and Pharisees ==
Within the context of Luke 15, these three parables — the Lost Sheep, the Lost Coin, and the Lost Son — make up a dual plea for repentance to the audience of Publicans and sinners and a  rebuttal to the listening Pharisees.
The Publicans in the audience were considered the dregs of local society -- sell-outs as tax collectors to the Roman occupiers and purveyors of vice.  They were the social equivalent of the sinful son in the parable.

The Pharisees' accusation to Jesus had been: "This man welcomes [[sinners|sinners]] and eats with them."  They may have been referring obliquely to [[Psalm|Psalm]] 1:1:
: Blessed is the man
:: who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked
:: or stand in the way of sinners
:: or sit in the seat of mockers.
Their pride and judgmental reaction to Jesus associating with sinners was equivalent to the reaction of the faithful son in the parable.

In each parable, Jesus illustrates that even nonreligious people make an extra effort to go after something or someone in peril: a sheep, a coin, or welcoming back a son. Since Jesus saw "sinners" as people in peril, it would be only natural that He spend time with them.{{fact|date=March 2007}} Thus He not only rebuffs the Pharisee's accusations, but justifies His own actions as correct and natural. And "Forgiveness is paramount to being a true Christian"{{fact|date=March 2007}} as Jesus replied to a man's question, "How many times must we forgive our neighbors Lord?" and Jesus replies; " I say not unto thee, Until seven times: but, Until seventy times seven." Matthew 18:22
