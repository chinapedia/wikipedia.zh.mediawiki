'''系詞'''（{{lang-en|copula}}、複數為{{lang|en|copulas}}或{{lang|en|copulae}}、英文簡稱：cop），又譯為'''繫詞'''、'''系動詞'''、'''联系动词'''，在[[語言學|語言學]]上為表示用於與[[謂詞|謂詞]]（[[主語補語|主語補語]]）鏈接一個[[句子|句子]]之[[主詞|主詞]]的字詞，比如在一個句子"The sky '''is''' blue.（天空是藍色的）"中的單詞<is>。系詞源於[[拉丁語|拉丁語]]名詞為"鏈接"（link）或"結合"（tie）兩個不同"事件"（thing）之功能語詞。<ref>See the appendix to Moro 1997 and the references cited there for a short history of the copula.</ref>

一個系詞往往是一個[[動詞|動詞]]或"類動詞"（verb-like）的字詞，雖然這不是普遍的情況。<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pustet |first=Regina |title=Copulas: Universals in the Categorization of the Lexicon |series=Oxford studies in typology and linguistic theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-928180-7}}</ref> 一個動詞如為一個系詞有時被稱為"繫辭"（copulative）或"連系動詞"（copular verb）。在英語[[初等教育|初等教育]][[语法|语法]]教學的課程，一個系動詞通常被稱為"連系動詞"（linking verb）。在其他語言中，系動詞表現出更多相似於[[代詞|代詞]]之處，如古典漢語[[文言文|文言文]]及[[瓜拉尼語|瓜拉尼語]]。或則可能需要連接到一個名詞使用為[[後綴|後綴]]的形式，比如在[[貝哈語|貝哈語]]（Beja language）、[[愒語|愒語]]，和[[因紐特語系|因紐特語系]]裡的應用。

<!--
== 語法功能 ==
The principal use of a copula is to link the [[subject_(grammar)|subject]] of a [[clause_(grammar)|clause]] to the [[predicate_(grammar)|predicate]]. A copular verb is often considered to be part of the predicate, the remainder being called a [[predicative_expression|predicative expression]]. A simple clause containing a copula is illustrated below:
::The book '''is''' on the table.
In this English sentence, the [[noun_phrase|noun phrase]] ''the book'' is the subject, the verb ''is'' serves as the copula, and the [[prepositional_phrase|prepositional phrase]] ''on the table'' is the predicative expression. The whole expression ''is on the table'' may (in some theories of grammar) be called a predicate or a [[verb_phrase|verb phrase]].

The predicative expression accompanying the copula – also known as the [[complement_(grammar)|complement]] of the copula – may take any of several possible forms: it may for example be a noun or noun phrase, an [[adjective|adjective]] or adjective phrase, a prepositional phrase (as above) or another adverb or adverbial phrase expressing time or location. Examples are given below (with the copula in bold and the predicative expression in italics):
::Mary and John '''are''' ''my friends''.
::The sky '''was''' ''blue''.
::I '''am''' ''taller than most people''.
::The birds and the beasts '''were''' ''there''.

The three components (subject, copula and predicative expression) do not necessarily appear in that order – their positioning depends on the rules for [[word_order|word order]] applicable to the language in question. In English (an [[subject-verb-object|SVO]] language) the ordering given is the normal one, although here too certain variation is possible:
* In many questions and other clauses with [[subject–auxiliary_inversion|subject–auxiliary inversion]], the copula moves in front of the subject: '''''Are you''' happy?''
* In [[inverse_copular_constructions|inverse copular constructions]] (see below) the predicative expression precedes the copula, while the subject follows it: ''In the room were three men.''

It is also possible in certain circumstances for one (or even two) of the three components to be absent:
* In [[null-subject_language|null-subject]] (pro-drop) languages, the subject may be omitted, as it may from other types of sentence. For example, in Italian, ''sono stanco'' means "I am tired", literally "am tired".
* In [[non-finite_clause|non-finite clause]]s in languages such as English, the subject is often absent, as in the [[participial_phrase|participial phrase]] ''being tired'' or the [[infinitive_phrase|infinitive phrase]] ''to be tired''. The same applies to most imperative sentences, such as ''Be good!''
* For cases where no copula appears, see {{p/s|Zero copula}} below.
* Any of the three components may be omitted as a result of various general types of [[ellipsis_(grammar)|ellipsis]]. In particular, in English, the predicative expression may be elided in a construction similar to [[verb_phrase_ellipsis|verb phrase ellipsis]], as in short sentences like ''I am''; ''Are they?'' (where the predicative expression is understood from the previous context).

[[Inverse_copular_constructions|Inverse copular constructions]], in which the positions of the predicative expression and the subject are reversed, are found in various languages.<ref>See Everaert et al. 2006.</ref> These have been the subject of much theoretical analysis, particularly in regard to the difficulty of maintaining, in the case of such sentences, the usual division into a subject [[noun_phrase|noun phrase]] and a predicate [[verb_phrase|verb phrase]]. Another issue is [[agreement_(linguistics)|verb agreement]] when both subject and predicative expression are noun phrases (and differ in number or person): in English the copula normally agrees with the preceding phrase, even if it is not logically the subject, as in ''the cause of the riot '''is''''' (not ''are'') ''these pictures of the wall''. Compare Italian ''la causa della rivolta '''sono''''' ("are", not ''è'' "is") ''queste foto del muro''.

== 意義 ==
Predicates formed using a copula may express identity – that the two noun phrases (subject and complement) have the same [[referent|referent]] or express an identical concept:
::I only want ''to be'' myself.
::The Morning Star ''is'' the Evening Star.
 
They may also express membership of a class, or a [[subset|subset]] relationship:
::She ''was'' a nurse.
::Dogs ''are'' carnivorous mammals.

Similarly they may express some property, relation or position, whether permanent or temporary:
:: The trees ''are'' green.
:: I ''am'' your boss.
:: The hen ''is'' next to the cockerel.
:: The children ''are'' confused.

Other special uses of copular verbs are described in some of the following sections.

=== 本質與狀態 ===
Some languages use different copulas, or different syntax, when denoting a permanent, essential characteristic of something and when denoting a temporary state. For examples of this, see the sections below on the [[#Romance|Romance languages]], [[#Slavic|Slavic languages]] and [[#Irish|Irish]].

== 形式 ==
In many languages the principal copula is a [[verb|verb]], such as English ''(to) be'', German ''sein'', French ''être'', etc. This may inflect for [[grammatical_category|grammatical categories]] such as [[grammatical_tense|tense]], [[grammatical_aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical_mood|mood]], like other verbs in the language. As a very commonly used verb, it is likely that the copula will have [[irregular_verb|irregular]] inflected forms; this is the case in English, where the verb ''be'' has a number of highly irregular ([[suppletion|suppletive]]) forms, and in fact has a larger number of different inflected forms than any other English verb (''am'', ''is'', ''are'', ''was'', ''were'', etc.; see [[English_verbs|English verbs]] for details).

Other copulas show more resemblances to [[pronoun|pronoun]]s. This is the case for [[Classical_Chinese|Classical Chinese]] and [[Guarani_language|Guarani]], for instance. In highly [[synthetic_language|synthetic language]]s, copulas are often [[suffix|suffix]]es, attached to a noun, that may still behave otherwise like ordinary verbs, for example ''-u-'' in [[Inuit_languages|Inuit languages]]. In some other languages, such as [[Beja_language|Beja]] and [[Ket_language|Ket]], the copula takes the form of suffixes that attach to a noun but are distinct from the [[grammatical_conjugation|person agreement markers]] used on [[predicative_verb|predicative verb]]s.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Stassen |first=Leon |year=1997 |title=Intransitive Predication |series=Oxford studies in typology and linguistic theory |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=39 |isbn=978-0-19-925893-2}}</ref> This phenomenon is known as ''[[nonverbal_person_agreement|nonverbal person agreement]]'' (or ''nonverbal subject agreement'') and the relevant markers are always established as deriving from [[clitic|clitic]]ized independent pronouns.

For cases where the copula is omitted or takes [[zero_(linguistics)|zero]] form, see {{p/s|Zero copula}} below.

== 動詞系動詞的其他用途 ==
A copular verb may also have other uses supplementary to or distinct from its uses as a copula.

=== 作為助動詞 ===
The English copular verb ''be'' can be used as an [[English_auxiliaries|auxiliary verb]], expressing [[passive_voice|passive voice]] (together with the [[past_participle|past participle]]) or expressing [[progressive_aspect|progressive aspect]] (together with the [[present_participle|present participle]]). For example:
::The man '''was''' killed. (passive)
::It '''is''' raining. (progressive)
Other languages' copulas also have uses as auxiliaries. For example, French ''être'' can be used to express passive voice similarly to English ''be'', and both French ''être'' and German ''sein'' are used to express the [[Perfect_(grammar)|perfect forms]] of certain verbs:
::''Je '''suis''' venu.'' French for "I have come", literally "I am come."
This last usage was formerly prevalent in English also. The auxiliary functions of these verbs derive from their copular function, and can be interpreted as a special case of the copular function (the verbal form that follows it being considered adjectival).

Another auxiliary-type usage of the copula in English is together with the [[to-infinitive|''to''-infinitive]] to denote an obligatory action or expected occurrence: "I am to serve you"; "The manager is to resign". This can also be put into past tense: "We were to leave at 9". For forms like "if I was/were to come", see [[English_conditional_sentences|English conditional sentences]].

=== 存在性的用法 ===
The English ''to be'', and its equivalents in certain other languages, also have a non-copular use as an existential verb, meaning "to exist". This use is illustrated in the following sentences: ''I want only '''to be''', and that is enough''; ''[[Cogito_ergo_sum|I think therefore I '''am''']]''; ''[[To_be,_or_not_to_be|'''To be''' or not '''to be''']], that is the question.'' In these cases the verb itself expresses a predicate (that of [[existence|existence]]), rather than linking to a predicative expression as it does when used as a copula. In [[ontology|ontology]] it is sometimes suggested that the "is" of existence is reducible to the "is" of property attribution or class membership; to be, [[Aristotle|Aristotle]] held, is to be ''something''. However [[Abelard|Abelard]] in his ''Dialectica'' made a ''[[reductio_ad_absurdum|reductio ad absurdum]]'' argument against the idea that the copula can express existence.<ref>Kneale - Kneale 1962 and Moro 1997</ref>

Similar examples can be found in many other languages; for example, the French and Latin equivalents of ''I think therefore I am'' are ''Je pense, donc je '''suis''''' and ''Cogito ergo '''sum''''', where ''suis'' and ''sum'' are the equivalents of English ''am'', normally used as copulas. However other languages prefer a different verb for existential use, as in the Spanish version ''Pienso, luego '''existo''''' (where the verb ''existir'' "to exist" is used rather than the copula ''ser'' or ''estar'' "to be"). 

Another type of existential usage is in clauses of the ''[[there_is|there is]]...'' or ''there are...'' type. Languages differ in the way they express such meanings; some of them use the copular verb, possibly with an [[expletive_pronoun|expletive pronoun]] like the English ''there'', while other languages use different verbs and constructions, like the French ''il y a'' (which uses parts of the verb ''avoir'' "to have", not the copula ''être'') or the Swedish ''finns'' (the passive voice of the verb for "to find"). For details, see [[existential_clause|existential clause]].

Relying on a unified theory of copular sentences, it has been proposed that the English ''there''-sentences are subtypes of [[inverse_copular_construction|inverse copular construction]]s.<ref>See Moro 1997, and "existential sentences and expletive ''there''" in Everaert et al. 2006, for a detailed discussion of this issue and a historical survey of the major proposals.</ref>

{{Main|Zero copula}}

In some languages, copula omission occurs within a particular grammatical context. For example, speakers of [[Russian_language|Russian]], [[Hungarian_language|Hungarian]], [[Arabic_language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew_language|Hebrew]], and [[Quechuan_languages|Quechuan languages]] consistently drop the copula in present tense: Russian: я — человек, ''ya — chelovek'' "I (am a) person"; Hungarian: ''ő ember'', "s/he (is) a human"; Arabic: أنا إنسان ''ʔanā ʔinsān'', "I (am) a human"; Hebrew: אני אדם ''ʔani ʔadam'' "I (am a) human"; Southern Quechua: ''payqa runam'' "s/he (is) a human".  This usage is known generically as the zero copula. Note that in other tenses (sometimes in other persons besides third singular) the copula usually reappears.

In informal speech of English, the copula may be dropped, as in the sentence, "She a nurse". This is a feature of [[African_American_vernacular_English|African American vernacular English]] but is also used by a variety of English speakers in informal contexts.<ref>Bender, Emily (2000) Syntactic Variation and Linguistic Competence: The Case of AAVE Copula Absence. Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford University</ref>

{{citation needed span|text=In Ancient Greek, when an adjective precedes a noun with an article, the copula is understood.  Thus, ὁ οἴκος ἐστὶ μακρός, "the house is large," can be written μακρός ὁ οἴκος, "large the house (is)."

In Quechua ([[Southern_Quechua|Southern Quechua]] used for the examples) zero copula is restricted to present tense in third person singular only (''kan''): ''Payqa runam''  — "(s)he is a human"; but: ''(paykuna) runakunam kanku'' "(they) are human".
|reason=English, Hungarian, and Irish are treated at 'Zero copula'. There are no references for Greek or Quechua here or on that page.|date=February 2014}}

In [[Maori_language|Maori]], the zero copula can be used in [[predicative_expression|predicative expression]]s and with continuous verbs (many of which take a copulative verb in many Indo-European languages) — ''He nui te whare'', literally "a big the house", "the house (is) big"; ''I te tēpu te pukapuka'', literally "at (past [[locative|locative]] particle) the table the book", "the book (was) on the table"; ''Nō Ingarangi ia'', literally "from England (s)he", "(s)he (is) from England"; ''Kei te kai au'', literally "at the (act of) eating I", "I (am) eating".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_mao |title=Language Maori |publisher=WALS Online |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = Moorfield | first = John | year = 2004 |  title = Te Kākano | publisher = University of Waikato}}</ref>

Alternatively, in many cases, the particle ''ko'' can be used as a copulative, (though not all instances of ''ko'' are used to this effect since, like all Maori particles, ''ko'' has multiple purposes): ''Ko nui te whare'' "The house is big"; ''Ko te pukapuka kei te tēpu'' "It is the book (that is) on the table"; ''Ko au kei te kai'' "It is me eating".

However, when expressing identity or class membership, ''ko'' must be used: ''Ko tēnei tāku pukapuka'' "This is my book"; ''Ko Ōtautahi he tāone i Te Waipounamu'' "Christchurch is a city in the South Island (of New Zealand)"; ''Ko koe tōku hoa'' "You are my friend".

Note that when expressing identity, ''ko'' can be placed on either object in the clause without changing the meaning (''ko tēnei tāku pukapuka'' is the same as ''ko tāku pukapuka tēnei''), but not on both (''ko tēnei ko tāku pukapuka'' would be equivalent to saying "it is this, it is my book" in English).

In Hungarian, zero copula is restricted to present tense in third person singular and plural: ''Ő ember''/''Ők emberek'' — "s/he is a human"/"they are humans"; but: ''(én) ember vagyok'' "I am a human", ''(te) ember vagy'' "you are a human", ''mi emberek vagyunk'' "we are humans", ''(ti) emberek vagytok'' "you (all) are humans". The copula also reappears for stating locations: ''az emberek a házban vannak'', "the people are in the house," and for stating time: ''hat óra van'', "it is six o'clock." However, the copula may optionally get omitted in colloquial language: ''hat óra (van),'' "it is six o'clock."

Hungarian uses a copula to say ''Itt van Róbert'' "Bob is here" (and this not only with regard to third person singular/plural), but not to say ''Róbert öreg'' "Bob is old". This is to relate a subject to a more temporary condition/state taking place in ''space'' (very often in the sense of [[Lojban|Lojban]] ''zvati'': ''la rabyrt. zvati ne'i le zdani'' "Robert is in the house").

Further restrictions may apply before omission is permitted. For example, in the [[Irish_language|Irish language]], ''is'', the present tense of the copula, may be omitted when the [[Predicate_(grammar)|predicate]] is a noun. ''Ba'' the past/conditional cannot be deleted. If the present copula is omitted, the following pronoun ''é, í, iad'' preceding the noun is omitted as well.

== 其他系動詞 ==
Sometimes the term ''copula'' is taken to include not only a language's equivalent(s) to the verb ''be'', but also other verbs or forms which serve to link a subject to a predicative expression (while adding [[semantic|semantic]] content of their own). For example, English verbs such as ''become'', ''get'', ''feel'', ''look'' and ''seem'' can have this function, as in the following sentences (where the predicative expression – the complement of the verb – is in italics):
::She became ''a student''.
::They look ''tired''.
(This usage should be distinguished from the use of some of these verbs as "action" verbs, as in ''They look at the wall'', where ''look'' denotes an action and cannot be replaced by the basic copula ''are''.) 

Some verbs have rarer, secondary uses as copular verbs, such as the verb ''fall'' in sentences like ''The zebra fell victim to the lion.''

These extra copulas are sometimes called "semi-copulas" or "pseudo-copulas".<ref>C.S. Butler, ''Structure and Function: A Guide to the Three Major Structural-Functional Theories'', John Benjamins Publishing, 2003, pp. 425–426.</ref> For a list of common verbs of this type in English, see [[List_of_English_copulae|List of English copulae]].-->

{{Main|Indo-European copula}}

In [[Indo-European_language|Indo-European language]]s, the words meaning ''to be'' are sometimes similar to each other. Due to the high frequency of their use, their inflection retains a considerable degree of similarity in some cases. Thus, for example, the English form ''is'' is a [[cognate|cognate]] of German ''ist'', Latin ''est'' and Russian ''<nowiki>jest'</nowiki>'', even though the Germanic, Italic and Slavic language groups split at least 3000 years ago. The origins of the copulas of most Indo-European languages can be traced back to four [[Proto-Indo-European_language|Proto-Indo-European]] stems: ''*es-'' (''*h<sub>1</sub>es-''), ''*sta-'' (''*steh<sub>2</sub>-''), ''*wes-'' and ''*bhu-'' (''*bʰuH-'').

===格魯吉亞語===
As in English, the verb "to be" (''qopna'') is irregular in [[Georgian_language|Georgian]] (a [[South_Caucasian_languages|Kartvelian language]]); different verb roots are employed in different tenses. The roots -''ar''-, -''kn''-, -''qav''-, and -''qop''- (past participle) are used in the present tense, future tense, past tense and the perfective tenses respectively. Examples:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''ar.
| "I ''am'' a teacher."
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli vi''kn''ebi''.
| "I ''will be'' a teacher."
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli vi''qav''i''.
| "I ''was'' a teacher."
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''qop''ilv''ar.
| "I ''have been'' a teacher."
|-
| ''Masc'avlebeli v''qop''ili''qav''i''.
| "I ''had been'' a teacher."
|}

Note that, in the last two examples (perfective and pluperfect), two roots are used in one verb compound. In the perfective tense, the root ''qop'' (which is the expected root for the perfective tense) is followed by the root ''ar'', which is the root for the present tense. In the pluperfective tense, again, the root ''qop'' is followed by the past tense root ''qav''. This formation is very similar to [[German_language|German]] (an [[Indo-European_languages|Indo-European language]]), where the perfect and the pluperfect are expressed in the following way:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Ich'' bin ''Lehrer'' gewesen.
| "I have been a teacher", literally "I ''am'' teacher ''been''."
|-
| ''Ich'' war ''Lehrer'' gewesen.
| "I had been a teacher", literally "I ''was'' teacher ''been''."
|}

Here, ''gewesen'' is the past participle of ''sein'' ("to be") in German. In both examples, as in Georgian, this participle is used together with the present and the past forms of the verb in order to conjugate for the perfect and the pluperfect aspects.

===羅曼斯語===
{{main|Romance copula}}
Copulas in the [[Romance_languages|Romance languages]] usually consist of two different verbs that can be translated as "to be", the main one from the Latin ''esse'' (via [[Vulgar_Latin|Vulgar Latin]] ''essere''; ''esse'' deriving from ''*es-''), often referenced as ''sum'', another of the Latin verb's [[principal_parts|principal parts]]), and a secondary one from ''stare'' (from ''*sta-''), often referenced as ''sto'', another of that Latin verb's [[principal_parts|principal parts]].  The resulting distinction in the modern forms is found in all the [[Iberian_Romance_languages|Iberian Romance languages]], and to a lesser extent Italian, but not in French or Romanian.  The difference is that the first usually refers to essential characteristics, while the second refers to states and situations, e.g., "Bob is old" versus "Bob is well". A similar division is found in the non-Romance Basque language (viz. ''egon'' and ''izan''). (Note that the English words just used, "essential" and "state", are also cognate with the Latin infinitives ''esse'' and ''stare''. The word "stay" also comes from Latin stare, through Middle French "estai", stem of Old French "ester".) In Spanish and Portuguese, the high degree of verbal [[inflection|inflection]], plus the existence of two copulas (''ser'' and ''estar''), means that there are 105 (Spanish) and 110 (Portuguese)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.conjuga-me.net |title=Conjugação de verbos regulares e irregulares |publisher=Conjuga-me |date=2007-09-06 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}</ref> separate forms to express the copula, compared to eight in English and one in Chinese.

|}

===斯拉夫語===
Some [[Slavic_language|Slavic language]]s make a distinction between essence and state (similar to that discussed in the above section on the [[#Romance|Romance]] languages), by putting a predicative expression denoting a state into the [[instrumental_case|instrumental case]], while essential characteristics are in the [[nominative_case|nominative]]. This can apply with other copula verbs as well (e.g. the verbs for "become" are normally used with the instrumental).

As noted above under {{p/s|Zero copula}}, Russian and other [[East_Slavic_languages|East Slavic languages]] generally omit the copula in the present tense.

===愛爾蘭語===
In [[Irish_language|Irish]] and [[Scottish_Gaelic|Scottish Gaelic]], not only are there two copulas but the [[syntax|syntax]] is also changed when one is distinguishing between states or situations and essential characteristics. Describing the subject's state or situation typically uses the normal [[verb–subject–object|VSO ordering]] with the verb ''bí''. The copula ''is'' is used to state essential characteristics or equivalences.

In Irish, the copula is used for things that are in a permanent state. 

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1" valign="top"
| align=left valign=top|  || align=right valign=top |  || align=left valign=top | 
|- 
|''Is fear Liam''|| "Liam is a man" ||(lit., is man Liam)
|- 
|''Is leabhar é sin''|| "That is a book" ||(lit., is book it that) 
|}

The word "is" is the copula (rhymes with the English word "hiss").  
The pronoun used with the copula is different from the normal pronoun.  For a masculine singular noun, "é" is used (for "he" or "it"), as opposed to the normal pronoun "sé"; for a feminine singular noun, "í" is used (for "she" or "it"), as opposed to normal pronoun "sí"; for plural nouns, "iad" is used (for "they" or "those"), as opposed to the normal pronoun "siad".<ref>Myles Dillon and Donncha ó Cróinín, Irish, Teach Yourself Books, Saint Paul's House, Warwick Lane London EC4. Lesson VIII, "The Copula", p. 52</ref>

To describe non-permanent states, "to be" is used, e.g., ''Tá mé ag rith'' "I am running".

===海地克里奧爾語===
[[Haitian_Creole_language|Haitian Creole]], a [[French-based_creole_language|French-based creole language]], has three forms of the copula: ''se'', ''ye'', and the [[zero_copula|zero copula]], no word at all (the position of which will be indicated with ''Ø'', just for purposes of illustration).

Although no textual record exists of Haitian-Creole at its earliest stages of development from French, ''se'' is derived from French {{IPA-fr|se|}} (written ''c'est''), which is the normal French contraction of {{IPA-fr|sə|}} (that, written ''ce'') and the copula {{IPA-fr|e|}} (is, written ''est'') (a form of the verb ''être'').

The derivation of ''ye'' is less obvious; but we can assume that the French source was {{IPA-fr|ile|}} ("he/it is", written ''il est''), which, in rapidly spoken French, is very commonly pronounced as {{IPA-fr|je|}} (typically written ''y est'').

The use of a zero copula is unknown in French, and it is thought to be an innovation from the early days when Haitian-Creole was first developing as a Romance-based [[pidgin|pidgin]].  Latin also sometimes used a zero copula.

Which of ''se'' / ''ye'' / ''Ø'' is used in any given copula clause depends on complex syntactic factors that we can superficially summarize in the following four rules:

1. Use ''Ø'' (i.e., no word at all) in declarative sentences where the complement is an adjective phrase, prepositional phrase, or adverb phrase:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Li te Ø an Ayiti.''
| "She was in Haiti." || (she ''past-tense'' in Haiti)
|-
| ''Liv-la Ø jon.''
| "The book is yellow." || (book-the yellow)
|-
| ''Timoun-yo Ø lakay.''
| "The kids are [at] home." || (kids-the home)
|}

2. Use ''se'' when the complement is a noun phrase.  But note that, whereas other verbs come ''after'' any tense/mood/aspect particles (like ''pa'' to mark negation, or ''te'' to explicitly mark past tense, or ''ap'' to mark progressive aspect), ''se'' comes ''before'' any such particles:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Chal se ekriven.''
| "Charles is writer."
|-
| ''Chal, ki se ekriven, pa vini.''
| "Charles, who is writer, not come."
|}

3. Use ''se'' where French and English have a [[dummy_pronoun|dummy "it"]] subject:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Se mwen!''
| "It's me!" French ''C'est moi!''
|-
| ''Se pa fasil.''
| "It's not easy," colloquial French ''C'est pas facile.''
|}

4. Finally, use the other copula form ''ye'' in situations where the sentence's syntax leaves the copula at the end of a phrase:

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| ''Kijan ou ye?''
| "How you are?"
|-
| ''Pou kimoun liv-la te ye?''
| "Whose book was it?" || (of who book-the ''past-tense'' is?)
|-
| ''M pa konnen kimoun li ye.''
| "I don't know who he is." || (I not know who he is)
|-
| ''Se yon ekriven Chal ye.''
| "Charles is a ''writer''!" || (it's a writer Charles is; cf. French ''C'est un écrivain qu'il est.'')
|}

The above is, however, only a simplified analysis.<ref>[[#Howe90|Howe 1990]].

===日語===
[[File:Ja_da_ya.png|thumb]]
'''[[日语|日语]]系词'''（在国文法中认为是助动词（{{jp|j=助動詞|rm=jodōshi|help=no}}）的一部分）最常翻译为英语的"be"动词。

日语系词有许多形式。{{lang|ja|「だ」}}和{{lang|ja|「です」}}两个词用于[[謂語|判断]]句，而{{lang|ja|「な」}}和{{lang|ja|「で」}}是在句子中用于修饰或连接的助词。

有系词的日语句子通常是在给一个事物与另一个事物画等号，也就是说，形式如同“A是B”。例子：

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| {{lang|ja|私は学生だ。}}
| ''Watashi wa gakusei da.'' || “我是学生。” || (lit., I <small>TOPIC</small> student <small>COPULA</small>)
|-
| {{lang|ja|これはペンです。}}
| ''Kore wa pen desu.'' || “这是钢笔。” || (lit., this <small>TOPIC</small> pen <small>COPULA-POLITE</small>)
|}

{{lang|ja|「だ」}}和{{lang|ja|「です」}}的区别很简单。{{lang|ja|「です」}}比{{lang|ja|「だ」}}[[日語敬語|更正式而尊敬]]。因此，许多句子如下面的句子在意义上几乎是相同的，它们的不同点在于说话者对听者的尊敬，以及他们对陈述的肯定程度上的细微差异。但{{lang|ja|「です」}}永远不会在句子结尾之前，{{lang|ja|「だ」}}仅用于描述从句。

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| {{lang|ja|あれはホテルだ。}}
| ''Are wa hoteru da''. || "That's a hotel." || (lit., that <small>TOPIC</small> hotel <small>COPULA</small>)
|-
| {{lang|ja|あれはホテルです。}}
| ''Are wa hoteru desu''. || "That is a hotel." || (lit., that <small>TOPIC</small> hotel <small>COPULA-POLITE</small>)
|}

日语中可以用系词或动词来形成判断句。但是，{{lang|ja|「です」}}不是所有时候都是谓语。在某些情况下，它的唯一作用是让用[[静态动词|静态动词]]作谓语的句子更有礼貌。不过，{{lang|ja|「だ」}}总是充当谓语，因此它不能与静态动词结合，因为句子只需要一个谓语。参见下面的例子。

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| {{lang|ja|このビールはおいしい。}}
| ''Kono bīru wa oishii.'' || “这瓶啤酒很好喝。” || (lit., this beer <small>TOPIC</small> be-tasty)
|-
| {{lang|ja|このビールはおいしいです。}}
| ''Kono bīru wa oishii desu.'' || “这瓶啤酒很好喝。” || (lit., this beer <small>TOPIC</small> be-tasty <small>POLITE</small>)
|-
| <sup>*</sup>{{lang|ja|このビールはおいしいだ。}}
| <sup>*</sup>''Kono bīru wa oishii da.'' || colspan=2 | 这是不正确的，因为{{lang|ja|「だ」}}只能用作谓语。
|}

{{lang|ja|「です」}}的起源有若干[[理論|理論]]；其中一个是说它是{{jp|j=「であります」|rm=de arimasu|help=no}}（{{jp|j=「である」|rm=de aru|help=no}}的礼貌形式）。一般来说，这两种形式只用于写作和更正式的情况。另一种形式{{jp|j=「でございます」|rm=de gozaimasu|help=no}}比{{lang|ja|「であります」}}更为正式，其词源是{{jp|j=「でござる」|rm=de gozaru|help=no}}接续敬语语尾{{jp|j=「-ます」|rm=-masu|help=no}}，也在一些情况下使用，非常有礼貌。注意{{lang|ja|「である」}}和{{lang|ja|「でござる」}}被认为是助词{{jp|j=「で」|rm=de|help=no}}与存在动词{{lang|ja|「ある」}}和{{lang|ja|「ござる」}}结合而成的。{{jp|j=「です」|rm=desu|help=no}}在口语中可能会读成{{jp|j=「っす」|rm=ssu|help=no}}。系词在日本各地受到方言变化的影响，形成诸如[[近畿方言|关西]]的{{jp|j=や|rm=ya|help=no}}和[[廣島市|广岛]]的{{jp|j=じゃ|rm=ja|help=no}}（见右图）。

日语还有两个对应于英语“to be”的动词：{{lang|ja|「ある」}}和{{lang|ja|「いる」}}。它们不是系词而是存在动词。{{lang|ja|「ある」}}用于无生命物体，包括植物，而{{lang|ja|「いる」}}用于有生命物体，如人、动物和机器人，虽然例外情况。

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| {{lang|ja|本はテーブルにある。}}
| ''Hon wa tēburu ni aru''. || “书在桌子上。”
|-
| {{lang|ja|小林さんはここにいる。}}
| ''Kobayashi-san wa koko ni iru''. || “小林在这里。”
|}

[[日语|日本人]]在学英语的时候经常把助动词"be"或"do"丢掉，误认为"be"与{{lang|ja|「です」}}和{{lang|ja|「だ」}}一样在语义上是空系词。<ref>{{cite journal | journal = TESL Working Paper Series | title = The English Copula Be: Japanese Learners’ Confusion | author = Sayuri Kusutani | volume = 4 | issue = 2 | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://www.hpu.edu/CHSS/LangLing/TESOL/ProfessionalDevelopment/200680TWPfall06/04Kusutani_Syntax.pdf |archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20121201023548/http://www.hpu.edu/CHSS/LangLing/TESOL/ProfessionalDevelopment/200680TWPfall06/04Kusutani_Syntax.pdf|archivedate =2008-12-12 |format=PDF}}</ref><!--

===韓國話===
For sentences with '''predicate nominatives''', the copula "이다" (i-da) is added to the predicate nominative (with no space in between).

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 바나나는 과일이다. 
| ''Ba-na-na-neun gwa-il-i-da.''. || "Bananas are a fruit."
|}

Some adjectives (usually color adjectives) are nominalized and used with the copula "이다".

1. Without the copula "이다":

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 바나나는 노랗다. 
| ''ba-na-na-neun no-rat-da.''. || "Bananas are yellow."
|}

2. With the copula "이다":

:{| border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="1"
| align=left |  || align=right |  || align=left | 
|-
| 바나나는 노란색이다. 
| ''ba-na-na-neun no-ran-saek-i-da.''. || "Bananas are yellow-coloured."
|}

Some Korean adjectives are derived using the copula. Separating these articles and nominalizing the former part will often result in a sentence with a related, but different meaning. Using the separated sentence in a situation where the un-separated sentence is appropriate is usually acceptable as the listener can decide what the speaker is trying to say using the context.-->

===汉语===
在[[汉语|汉语]]中，状态和品质一般用[[静态动词|静态动词]]（如[[官话|官话]]中的累、饿、在、笨等等）表示，不需要系词连接。句子可以简单地由代词和这样的动词组成：例如“我饿”。然而通常，表达品质的动词由副词（“非常”、“不”、“相当”等）来修饰；当没有其他修饰时，它们通常跟在“很”（意思是“非常”）的后面，但在这种用法中通常没有具体的意思。参见[[汉语语法|汉语语法]]。

只有名词作为补语的句子（例如“这是我的妹妹”）使用系动词“是”。这经常用到：例如，不常说“是中国的”，常用的表达是“是中国人”（我是中国人，"I am a Chinese person"）。这里的“是”是一个{{le|等格|equative}}动词。另一种可能性是补语只是一个名词修饰语（以“的”字结尾），名词省略：我的汽车是红色的（即“我的汽车是红色的汽车”）。

[[汉朝|汉朝]]以前，“是”用作{{le|指示代词|demonstrative pronoun}}，意思是“这”（这种用法在一些成语和谚语以及日语中保留下来）。一些语言学界认为“是”之所以发展成为系动词是因为其在句子的主语之后，经常作为重复主语出现（在[[文言文|文言文]]中，我们可以说“乔治·W·布什，''是''美国之总统”，直译是“乔治·W·布什这个美国总统”，也就表明了“乔治·W·布什''是''美国总统”）。<ref>{{cite book|last=Pulleyblank|first=Edwin G.|title=Outline of Classical Chinese Grammar|publisher=UBC Press|year=1995|location=Vancouver|isbn=0-7748-0541-2}}{{page needed|date=January 2015}}</ref> “是”这个字是由'''日'''和'''正'''两个字[[六書|结合]]而成的。

现代汉语中“是”可以和“的”字连用，表示应承或同意。
例如：问：你的汽车是不是红色的？
答：是的。意思是“就是红色的”，或者回答“不是”，意思是“不是红色的”。（当然也可以回答“对”或“不对”。）“是”还有一种用法是“是……的”结构，用来强调句子的特定成分；参见[[汉语语法|汉语语法→分裂句]]。

在[[泉漳片|泉漳闽语]]中“是”（''sī''）用作系词，与[[吴语|吴语]]中的“是”{{IPA|/z/}}相同。[[广州话|粤语]]使用“係” （[[香港語言學學會粵語拼音方案|粤拼]]：hai6）而不用“是”；同样，[[客家语|客家话]]也用“係”（''he<sup>55</sup>''）。<!--

===蘇安語系===
In Siouan languages like [[Lakota_language|Lakota]], in principle almost all words — according to their structure — are verbs. So not only (transitive, intransitive and so-called 'stative') verbs but even nouns often behave like verbs and do not need to have copulas.

For example, the word ''wičháša'' refers to a man, and the verb "to-be-a-man" is expressed as ''wimáčhaša/winíčhaša/wičháša'' (I am/you are/he is a man). Yet there also is a copula ''héčha'' (to be a ...) that in most cases is used: ''wičháša hemáčha/heníčha/héčha'' (I am/you are/he is a man).

In order to express the statement "I am a doctor of profession," one has to say ''pezuta wičháša hemáčha''. But, in order to express that that person is THE doctor (say, that had been phoned to help), one must use another copula ''iyé'' (to be the one): ''pežúta wičháša (kiŋ) miyé yeló'' (medicine-man DEF ART I-am-the-one MALE ASSERT).

In order to refer to space (e.g., Robert is in the house), various verbs are used, e.g., ''yaŋkÁ'' (lit.: to sit) for humans, or ''háŋ/hé'' (to stand upright) for inanimate objects of a certain shape. "Robert is in the house" could be translated as ''Robert thimáhel yaŋké (yeló)'', whereas "there's one restaurant next to the gas station" translates as "owótethipi wígli-oínažiŋ kiŋ hél isákhib waŋ hé".

===人工語言===
The [[constructed_language|constructed language]] [[Lojban|Lojban]] has copulas, but they are rarely used, and are sometimes viewed with distaste in the Lojban community, because all words that express a predicate can be used as verbs. The three sentences "Bob runs", "Bob is old", and "Bob is a fireman", for instance, would all have the same form in Lojban: ''"la bob. bajra"'', ''"la bob. tolcitno"'', and ''"la bob. fagdirpre"''. There are several different copulas: ''me'' turns whatever follows the word ''me'' into a verb that means ''to be'' what it follows. For example, ''me la bob.'' means ''to be Bob.'' Another copula is ''du'', which is a verb that means all its arguments are the same thing (equal).<ref>[http://ptolemy.tlg.uci.edu/~opoudjis/lojbanbrochure/lessons/less12eq.html Lojban For Beginners]</ref>

The [[E-Prime|E-Prime]] language, based on English, simply avoids the issue by not having a generic copula. It requires instead a specific form such as "remains", "becomes", "lies", or "equals".

[[Esperanto|Esperanto]] uses the copula much as English. The infinitive is ''esti'', and the whole conjugation is regular (as with all Esperanto verbs). In addition, adjectival roots can be turned into stative verbs: ''La ĉielo bluas.'' "The sky is blue."

Likewise, [[Ido_(language)|Ido]] has a copula that works as English "to be". Its infinitive is ''esar'', and, as is the case in Esperanto, all of its forms are regular: The simple present is ''esas'' for all persons; the simple past is ''esis'', the simple future is ''esos'', and the imperative is ''esez'', among a few more forms. However, Ido also has an alternative irregular form for the simple present ("es"), which some Idists frown upon. The possibility to turn adjectives and even nouns into verbs also exist, although this is mostly done by means of an affix, on top of the verbal endings. The affix is "-es-". So, "The sky is blue." can be said as "La cielo bluesas". As can be seen, the suffix "-es-" plus the verbal desinence "-as" are simply the verb "to be" annexed to the adjectival or nominal root.

[[Interlingua|Interlingua]] speakers use copulas with the same freedom as speakers of Slavic, Germanic, and Romance languages. In addition to combinations with ''esser'' ('to be'), expressions such as ''cader prede'' ('to fall prey') are common. ''Esser'' is stated, rather than omitted as in Russian.
