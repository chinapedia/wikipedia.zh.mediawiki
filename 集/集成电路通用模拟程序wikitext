'''[[積體電路|積體電路]]通用模拟程序'''（{{lang-en|'''Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis, SPICE'''}}），是一种用于电路描述与[[电子电路仿真|仿真]]的语言与仿真器软件，用于检测电路的连接和功能的完整性，以及用于预测电路的行为。SPICE主要用于模拟电路和混合信号电路的仿真。由此我們便可以清楚地了解：SPICE這套程式原先發展的目的是為了模-{}-擬電子系統中日益重要的積體電路。

由於積體電路不如傳統[[電路|電路]]一般可以在[[麵包板|麵包板]]（breadboard）或印刷電路板（Printed circuit board）上做實驗來驗證設計結果，所以為了提高積體電路正式生產時的良率（yield）及降低成本，勢必要在進入實際製程階段前對其電路特性做「檢查」，確保性能在規格範圍之內。

== 發展歷史 ==
SPICE是在1975年由[[加利福尼亞大學|加利福尼亞大學]][[柏克萊加州大學|伯克莱分校]]的Donald Pederson在电子研究实验室首先建立的。第一版和第二版都是用[[Fortran|Fortran]]语言编写的，但是从第三版开始用[[C|C]]语言编写。以一"Computer Analysis of Nonlinear Circuits, Excluding Radiation"名為“CANCER”的電路模擬程式為藍本，發展出今日幾乎被全世界公認為電路模擬標準的SPICE原始雛型程式。

SPICE有好几种版本，成功的商业版本主要有[[SPECTRE|SPECTRE]]（由最初的SPICE作者之一Ken Kundert和Jacob White开始最初的框架）和[[HSPICE|HSPICE]]（最初由Meta-Software开发，现属于[[新思科技|Synopsys]]）、[[Eldo|Eldo]]（最初由Anacad公司开发，现属于[[Mentor_Graphics|Mentor Graphics]]）等。其后由于电路设计规模的级数级增长，旧版本的SPICE的仿真速度远远不能满足需要，并且对电路规模大小也有限制，业界发展了快速SPICE。

[[Silvaco|Silvaco]]公司的提供的Smartspice,	
SmartSpice提供最高的性能和精度，用于设计复杂的高精度模拟电路、模拟混合信号电路、分析关键网路，特性表征单元库等等。SmartSpice兼容于流行的模拟设计流程和foundry提供的器件模型。

今日在市面上所能看到的許多SPICE同類軟體：如OrCADPSpice（OrCAD）、HSPICE（Meta-Software；現屬於Synopsys）、IS-SPICE（intusoft）、IG-SPICE（A. B.Associates）、I-SPICE（NCSS timesharing）…等，均是以SPICE2系列為基礎再加改進而成的商業化產品。

目前成功的快速SPICE商业版本主要有HSIM（最初由NASSADA公司开发，现在NASSDA公司被SYNOPSYS公司购入）, NANOSIM（SYNOPSYS，但有电路规模大小的限制，对敏感的模拟电路也有精度的缺陷，在数字电路仿真方面很成功）和ADiT（Evercad，2006年1月被Mentor Graphics并购）、ULTRASIM（CADENCE公司的快速SPICE工具，属于最新的第三代电路仿真工具）等。目前的这些快速SPICE的主要特点是以牺牲准确性换取速度的大幅提高，因此他们的共同问题是如何在快速的同时保持准确性。

其中最廣為各級學校電子電機相關科系所使用的，就非[[OrCAD_PSpice|OrCAD PSpice]]莫屬了。

<!--'''SPICE''' (Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis) is a general purpose [[analog_circuit|analog circuit]] [[Electronic_circuit_simulation|simulator]].
It is a powerful program that is used in [[integrated_circuit|IC]] and board-level design to check the integrity of [[circuit_design|circuit design]]s and to predict [[Electronic_circuit|circuit]] behavior.

== Introduction ==
Integrated circuits, unlike board-level designs composed of discrete parts, are impossible to [[breadboard|breadboard]] before manufacture. Further, the high costs of photolithographic masks and other manufacturing prerequisites make it essential to design the circuit to be as close to perfect as possible before the integrated circuit is first built.  Simulating the circuit with SPICE is the industry-standard way to verify circuit operation at the transistor level before committing to manufacturing an integrated circuit.

Board-level designs can often be breadboarded, but designers may want more information about the circuit than is available from a single mock-up. For instance, performance is affected by component manufacturing tolerances and it is helpful for designers to simulate with SPICE to predict the effect of variations of those values.  Even with a breadboard, some aspects may not be accurate compared to the final printed wiring board, such as parasitic resistances and capacitances. In these cases it is common to perform [[Monte_Carlo_method|Monte Carlo]] simulations using SPICE, a task which is impractical using calculations by hand.

Circuit simulation programs, of which SPICE and derivatives are the most prominent, take a text [[netlist|netlist]] describing the circuit elements ([[transistors|transistors]], [[resistors|resistors]], [[capacitors|capacitors]], etc.) and their connections, and translate this description into equations to be solved.  The general equations produced are nonlinear [[differential_algebraic_equation|differential algebraic equation]]s which are solved using [[implicit_integration_methods|implicit integration methods]], [[Newton's_method|Newton's method]] and [[sparse_matrix|sparse matrix]] techniques.

== Origins ==
SPICE was developed at the Electronics Research Laboratory of the [[University_of_California,_Berkeley|University of California, Berkeley]] by Larry Nagel with direction from his research advisor, Prof. [[Donald_Pederson|Donald Pederson]].  SPICE1 was largely a derivative of the CANCER program,<ref>Nagel, L. W., and Rohrer, R. A., ''Computer Analysis of Nonlinear Circuits, Excluding Radiation'', IEEE Journal of Solid State Circuits, SC-6, Aug. 1971, pp. 166-182</ref> which Nagel had worked on under Prof. Ronald Rohrer. CANCER was an acronym for "Computer Analysis of Nonlinear Circuits, Excluding Radiation," a hint to Berkeley's liberalism of 1960s: at these times many circuit simulators were developed under the [[United_States_Department_of_Defense|United States Department of Defense]] contracts that required the capability to evaluate the [[radiation_hardness|radiation hardness]] of a circuit. When Nagel's original advisor, Prof. Rohrer, left Berkeley, Prof. Pederson became his advisor. Pederson insisted that CANCER, a proprietary program, be rewritten enough that restrictions could be removed and the program could be put in the public domain.<ref>Perry, T., ''Donald O. Pederson'',  IEEE Spectrum, June 1998, pp. 22-27.</ref>

SPICE1 was first presented at a conference in 1973.<ref>Nagel, L. W, and Pederson, D. O., ''SPICE（Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis）'', Memorandum No. ERL-M382, University of California, Berkeley, Apr. 1973</ref> SPICE1 was coded in [[FORTRAN|FORTRAN]] and used [[nodal_analysis|nodal analysis]] to construct the circuit equations.  Nodal analysis has limitations in representing inductors, floating voltage sources and the various forms of controlled sources.  SPICE1 had relatively few circuit elements available and used a fixed-timestep transient analysis.  The real popularity of SPICE started with SPICE2<ref name=spice2>Nagel, Laurence W., ''SPICE2: A Computer Program to Simulate Semiconductor Circuits'', Memorandum No. ERL-M520, University of California, Berkeley, May 1975</ref> in 1975.  SPICE2, also coded in FORTRAN, was a much-improved program with more circuit elements, variable timestep transient analysis using either trapezoidal or Gear integration, equation formulation via modified nodal analysis<ref>Ho, Ruehli, and Brennan, ''The Modified Nodal Approach to Network Analysis'', Proc. 1974 Int. Symposium on Circuits and Systems, San Francisco, Apr. 1974, pp. 505-509</ref> (avoiding the limitations of nodal analysis), and an innovative FORTRAN-based memory allocation system developed by another graduate student, Ellis Cohen.  The last FORTRAN version of SPICE was 2G.6 in [[1983|1983]].  SPICE3<ref>Quarles, Thomas L., ''Analysis of Performance and Convergence Issues for Circuit Simulation'', Memorandum No. UCB/ERL M89/42, University of California, Berkeley, Apr. 1989.</ref> was developed by Thomas Quarles (with [[A._Richard_Newton|A. Richard Newton]] as advisor) in 1989. It is written in [[C语言|C]], uses the same netlist syntax, and added [[X_Window|X Window]] plotting.

As an early [[open_source|open source]] program, SPICE was widely distributed and used.  It inspired and served as a basis for many other circuit simulation programs, in academia, in industry, and in commercial products.  Its ubiquity became such that "to SPICE a circuit" remains synonymous with circuit simulation.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pescovitz |first=David |url=http://www.coe.berkeley.edu/labnotes/0502/history.html |title=1972: The release of SPICE, still the industry standard tool for integrated circuit design  |publisher=Lab Notes: Research from the Berkeley College of Engineering |date=2002-05-02 |accessdate=2007-03-10}}</ref> SPICE source code was from the beginning distributed by UC Berkeley for a nominal charge (to cover the cost of magnetic tape). The license includes an acknowledgement clause and distribution restrictions for countries not considered friendly to the USA, nevertheless Berkeley SPICE continues to influence both commercial and academic offshoots of the program.  Early commercial versions of SPICE include HSPICE (now owned by [[Synopsys|Synopsys]]) and [[PSPICE|PSPICE]]（now owned by [[Cadence_Design_Systems|Cadence Design Systems]]）.  The academic spinoffs of SPICE include XSPICE, developed at [[Georgia_Institute_of_Technology|Georgia Tech]], which added mixed analog/digital "code models" for behavioral simulation, and Cider (previously CODECS, from UC Berkeley/Oregon State Univ.) which added [[semiconductor_device_modeling|semiconductor device simulation]].-->
