<!--
==歷史==
===成立及早年===
The team was founded in [[Airdrie,_North_Lanarkshire|Airdrie]], [[North_Lanarkshire|North Lanarkshire]] in 1878 as '''Excelsior Football Club''', changing its name to Airdrieonians in 1881.

The club enjoyed its most successful era in the 1920s following the signing of [[Hughie_Gallacher|Hughie Gallacher]] from [[Queen_of_the_South_F.C.|Queen of the South]] in 1921. Airdrie finished in second place in the Scottish League Championship four years in a row in between 1923 and 1926 as well as winning the [[Scottish_Cup|Scottish Cup]] in 1924. Following this victory, in early summer 1925, the club visited [[Norway|Norway]] and [[Sweden|Sweden]], and made a big impression. Translations of local newspaper reports, and some photographs of the tour, are still available<ref>[http://www.angelfire.com/space/airdrie/ "Airdrieonians in Norway/Sweden 1925"]</ref>. Gallacher was on board until 8 December 1925 when he departed to similarly terrorise defences in [[England|England]]. It was while at Airdrie in 1924 that the future member of the [[Wembley_Wizards|Wembley Wizards]] won his first international cap.

Airdrie spent much of the post war era "yo-yoing" between the top flight and [[Scottish_Football_League_Second_Division|Second Division]]. They reached the [[Scottish_Cup|Scottish Cup]] Final in 1975, losing 3–1 to [[Celtic_F.C.|Celtic]], and also the [[Texaco_Cup|Texaco Cup]] Final of 1972, losing 2–1 on aggregate to [[Derby_County_F.C.|Derby County]].

===阿歷斯·麥當奴年代===
[[Image:Airdriecelticcupfinal.jpg|thumb]] Final]]
During the 1990s, with [[Alex_MacDonald_(footballer_born_1948)|Alex MacDonald]] at the helm, Airdrie, having been members of the [[Scottish_Premier_Division|Premier Division]] in the [[1991–92_in_Scottish_football|1991–92]] and [[1992–93_in_Scottish_football|1992–93]] seasons, were regularly considered challengers for promotion and recognised as one of the bigger clubs in [[Scottish_Football_League_First_Division|First Division]]. [[Alex_MacDonald_(footballer_born_1948)|MacDonald]] also guided the Diamonds to two [[Scottish_Cup|Scottish Cup]] finals. The first appearance coming on 9 May 1992 when the club faced [[Rangers_F.C.|Rangers]] in front of 44,045 strong crowd at [[Hampden_Park|Hampden Park]]. Unfortunately for Airdrie on this occasion however, a goal each from [[Mark_Hateley|Mark Hateley]] and [[Ally_McCoist|Ally McCoist]] earned the blue half of [[Glasgow|Glasgow]] a 2–1 victory and sent the [[Alex_MacDonald_(footballer_born_1948)|MacDonald]]'s side home empty-handed. When the Diamonds returned to the national stadium three years later for their second attempt at [[Scottish_Cup|Scottish Cup]] glory they would this time face this time face the other half of the [[Old_Firm|Old Firm]] in the form of [[Celtic_F.C.|Celtic]]. But [[Alex_MacDonald_(footballer_born_1948)|MacDonald]] and Airdrie would once again fall at the final hurdle as they lost 1–0 to a [[Pierre_van_Hooijdonk|Pierre van Hooijdonk]] goal. Notably, this match took place on 27 May 1995; a mere seven years before the club went out of business

===進軍歐洲===
Though there was due heartache caused by the club's defeat in the [[Scottish_Cup_1991-92#Final|1992 Final]], Airdrie fans still had something positive to think about as they left [[Hampden_Park|Hampden]] that day.

With [[Rangers_F.C.|Rangers]] having won the [[Scottish_Football_League_Premier_Division|Premier Division]] and therefore qualified for the [[UEFA_Champions_League_1992–93|Champions League]] it meant Airdrie, as [[Scottish_Cup_1991-92|1992 Scottish Cup]] runners-up would represent [[Scotland|Scotland]] in the [[UEFA_Cup_Winners'_Cup_1992–93|1992–93 Cup Winners' Cup]]. This would be the club's first appearance in any European competition in their history.

Airdrie were drawn against [[Czech_Republic|Czech]] side [[Sparta_Prague|Sparta Prague]] in the [[UEFA_Cup_Winners'_Cup_1992–93#First_Round|First Round]] and the first leg of the tie was to take place at [[Broomfield_Park|Broomfield]]. The Diamonds would lose this encounter 1–0 and then go on to taste defeat in the [[Czech_Republic|Czech]] capital with the scoreline reading 2–1 in [[Sparta_Prague|Sparta]]'s favour. The club consequently lost the overall tie by an aggregate score of three goals to one and were eliminated from the competition.

Airdrie's only goal in the tie, subsequently the club only in any European competition, was [[Kenny_Black|Kenny Black]], who later went on to become manager of Airdrieonians' reincarnation [[Airdrie_United_F.C.|Airdrie United]].

===新建主場===
[[Image:broomfieldparkairdrie.jpg|thumb]]]]
For most of its history, Airdrieonians played at [[Broomfield_Park|Broomfield Park]] in [[Airdrie,_North_Lanarkshire|Airdrie]] town centre. The final game at [[Broomfield_Park|Broomfield]] took place in May 1994 after which the ground, having been sold to [[supermarket|supermarket]] chain [[Safeway_(UK)|Safeway]], was demolished to make room for their new store. The club's intention was to make use of the funds generated from the sale to build a new ten thousand capacity, all-seated stadium and therefore make the club eligible for entry into the [[Scottish_Premier_League|top tier of Scottish Football]] should they win the [[Scottish_Football_League_First_Division|First Division]]. The plan was fraught with problems, however, and acquiring planning permission for the new ground proved difficult. As a result of this Airdrie went on to groundshare with [[Clyde_F.C.|Clyde]] at [[Broadwood_Stadium|Broadwood Stadium]] in [[Cumbernauld|Cumbernauld]] for four seasons with the club eventually moving into its new home, the [[Excelsior_Stadium|Shyberry Excelsior Stadium]], in time for the [[1998–99_in_Scottish_football|1998–99]] season. Airdrieonians played their home games there until they were liquidated in 2002.

It is arguably this stadium re-location and the difficulties generated by it that was Airdrie's first step towards oblivion. The mismanagement of the entire situation by the club's board, as well as [[North_Lanarkshire|North Lanarkshire]] Council's lengthy delay in granting planning permission caused Airdrieonians' financial situation to reach critical level. This was not helped by the low attendances at [[Excelsior_Stadium|Excelsior Stadium]] following the completion of the move which, obviously, would be directly related to the quality of football on display - the poor nature of this having much to do with the Diamonds lack funds available to be spent on the team.

[[Image:Excelsior_Stadium.png|thumb]]]] The minimum stadium capacity for entry into the [[Scottish_Premier_League|Scottish Premier League]] has since been reduced from ten to six thousand following the controversy arising from the [[Falkirk_F.C.|Falkirk's]] 2003 denial of promotion (despite a proposed groundshare of [[New_Broomfield|New Broomfield]] with Airdrieonians re-imbodiment [[Airdrie_United_F.C.|Airdrie United]]) and the possibility of the situation repeating itself with [[Inverness_Caledonian_Thistle_F.C.|Inverness Caledonian Thistle]] the next year. Ironically [[Falkirk_F.C.|Falkirk]] would have been relegated at the end of the [[2001–02_in_Scottish_football|2001–02]] season after finishing ninth in the [[Scottish_Football_League_First_Division|First Division]], but their status in this league was preserved because of the demise of Airdrieonians.

Such a change came far too late to benefit Airdrie who had long since gone out of business, due to what could be said was merely an inevitable consequence of their trying to comply with the rules put in place at the time regarding admission to Scotland's top football league, which have since been recognised by the league to be completely unfeasible.

===Death of Joey Rowan===
Airdrieonians' demise was personified by the sudden and unexpected death of Joey Rowan, the club's sole remaining director. Rowan had a long and intimate association with the club and was son-in-law and advisor to Airdrieonians' long term benefactor Jack Dalziel (recognised by having the main stand named after him). Rowan, already a popular figure with the club's supporters due to his passion, candour and trademark ponytail, gained even more respect by remaining with Airdrieonians and incurring substantial personal losses whilst trying to steer the club away from liquidation despite the fact that the rest of the board had resigned amid finger-pointing and acrimony in an attempt to avoid reproach and financial liabilities. He is considered the club's last great hero for his selfless sacrifice and unyielding loyalty.

===Steve Archibald Attempted Takeover===
In February 2000, following the decision by the club's board to allow more private investment, [[Steve_Archibald|Steve Archibald]] put forth a bid for Airdrieonians Football Club. During the [[2000–01_in_Scottish_football|2000–01 football season]] [[Steve_Archibald|Archibald]], while constantly at odds with Airdrie liquidators [[KPMG|KPMG]] brought in many foreign players who quickly became popular with the fans. The former Aberdeen, [[Scotland_national_football_team|Scotland]] and [[Barcelona_F.C.|Barcelona]] star's reign at Airdrie came to and end early in 2001 when [[KPMG|KPMG]] terminated their deal with him citing that [[Steve_Archibald|Archibald]] had not kept up to date with payment of fees as their reason.

===Success in Face of Demise===
Apart from Airdrie's prominent record for a club of their size in the [[Scottish_Cup|Scottish Cup]] the Diamonds were also notably successful in the [[Scottish_Challenge_Cup|Scottish Challenge Cup]] which they won in both [[2000–01_in_Scottish_football|2000–01]] and [[2001–02_in_Scottish_football|2001–02]], the two seasons immediately prior to their liquidation. An interesting fact about these victories is that they were achieved under two different chairmen and managers and with radically altered teams. The first triumphant side was made up of [[Steve_Archibald|Steve Archibald]]'s extremely popular 'Spanish Armada'; the talented set of players [[Steve_Archibald|Archibald]] had brought in when he held preferred bidder status for Airdrieonians F.C. whose attacking, entertaining football had steadily won over the [[Excelsior_Stadium|New Broomfield]] crowd. Despite their aforementioned prowess, however, the side performed relatively poorly in the league finishing a disappointing 8th and therefore only narrowly avoiding relegation to the [[Scottish_Football_League_Second_Division|Second Division]]. Confirming their potential the core of this squad went on, following [[Steve_Archibald|Steve Archibald]]'s leaving the club, to play for [[Scottish_Premier_League|Premier League]] sides with striker and goalkeeper [[David_Fernández|David Fernández]] and [[Javier_Sánchez_Broto|Javier Sánchez Broto]] both eventually signing for [[Celtic_F.C.|Celtic]] while midfielders [[Jesús_García_Sanjuán|Jesus Sanjuán]] and [[Antonio_Calderon|Antonio Calderón]] went on to play for [[Kilmarnock_F.C.|Kilmarnock]]

The next year when the club won the competition with [[Ian_McCall|Ian McCall]]'s assortment of free transfers, loan signings and the very few players from the previous season who remained at Airdrie beyond [[Steve_Archibald|Archibald]] it seemed possible that Airdrie's long run of problems could be reaching their end; The club were chasing promotion and the financial conflict behind the scenes looked liked being resolved, but it was not to be.

===清盤及重生===
The club finally went out of business officially on 1 May 2002 due to its overwhelming debts. The final match played by '''Airdrieonians Football Club''' was an away game against [[Ayr_United_F.C.|Ayr United]] at [[Somerset_Park|Somerset Park]]. The match was abandoned by the referee after a crossbar was broken during a protest pitch invasion, and was never replayed.

[[Image:Airdrieunited.PNG|thumb]]
After the club went out of business, local accountant, [[Jim_Ballantyne|Jim Ballantyne]], attempted to gain entry to the [[Scottish_Football_League|SFL]] with a team by the name of [[Airdrie_United_Football_Club|Airdrie United Football Club]], effectively a direct replacement of Airdrieonians (similar to the way that [[Fiorentina|Fiorentina]] re-established themselves as [[Florentia_Viola|Florentia Viola]] following their own collapse under crippling debt). [[Airdrie_United_F.C.|Airdrie United]]'s initial bid for league status was rejected in favour of the application by [[Gretna_F.C.|Gretna]], who were then playing in the [[England|English]] [[Northern_Premier_League|Northern Premier League]].
 
In desperation, Ballantyne opted to buy control of [[Clydebank_F.C.|Clydebank]], another Scottish football club experiencing extreme financial hardship and, with [[Scottish_Football_League|SFL]] approval, the club's name was changed to [[Airdrie_United_F.C.|Airdrie United]], the team relocated to Airdrie and the strip was altered to the famous diamond style of Airdrieonians. Airdrie United are predominantly viewed as a continuation of Airdrieonians, with the majority of the same supporters attending [[Airdrie_United_F.C.|Airdrie United]] matches and the new club taking up the position of rivals to clubs such as [[Motherwell_F.C.|Motherwell]], [[Hamilton_Academical_F.C.|Hamilton Academical]], and [[Partick_Thistle|Partick Thistle]] who, historically, had had long standing enmity with Airdrieonians Football Club.
