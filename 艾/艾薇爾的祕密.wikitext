===Events===
While playing basketball at Marceline's house, [[Finn_the_Human|Finn]] and [[Jake_the_Dog|Jake]] are surprised to learn that Marceline invited the Ice King to play as well. After the two inquire, Marceline reveals that she had known the Ice King when he was still a human man named Simon Petrikov, 996 years before the timeframe of the episode.

The episode then flashes back 996 years, following the destruction of civilization in the mysterious Mushroom War. Simon and Marceline—who Simon affectionately called Marcy—wander the outskirts of a destroyed and unidentified city. After hearing a rustling from the woods, Simon is forced to put on the mysterious ice crown. The crown gives the wearer ice-related magic powers but also drains them of their sanity. Using the power of the crown, Simon freezes what was making the rustling: a deer. Marcy eventually manages to snap Simon out of his bout of craziness, and later that night Simon sings the theme song from the sitcom ''[[Cheers|Cheers]]'' to cheer her up. While laughing, Marcy begins to cough, and Simon realizes she is in need of medicine.

The two make their way into the ruins of the city looking for [[chicken_soup|chicken soup]] in order to cure Marcy's illness. Inside the ruins of a soupery, Simon and Marcy run into some sort of mutated slime-creature, but Simon manages to knock it out with this crown. The two flee and eventually discover what they believe is a food cart. Hopeful, Simon approaches it, only to realize that the vehicle is actually a mobile clam delivery service. Frustrated, Simon kicks the doors, which alerts several more slime creatures inside the vehicle. Simon, scared and hoping to protect Marcy, pushes the vehicle off of a bridge, and the resulting sound alerts a horde of the mutants. Simon and Marcy run into an alley, but are trapped. As a last resort, Simon places Marcy in an abandoned car and puts the crown on his head. In order to maintain his sanity, he sings the theme to ''Cheers'' while he unleashes a blast of ice which stops the mutant hordes in their tracks. Simon is able to eventually snap out of his insanity, and a mysterious sentient mass of bubblegum—presumably one of Princess Bubblegum's ancestors—subsequently gives him a can of chicken soup. Marcy tells Simon that she loves him. Simon hugs her back saying he loves her too, but calls her Gunter.

In the present, Marceline concludes her tale, to a shocked Finn and Jake and an oblivious Ice King. Marceline notes that Marcy and Simon "lived happily ever after", and Finn, Jake, and herself watch as the Ice King dunks several baskets, still unable to remember his former self.

==Production==
"Simon & Marcy" was storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]], from a story by Patrick McHale, [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], and [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]]. The episode was co-directed by Adam Muto and Nick Jennings; the former was credited as "supervising director", whereas the latter handled the art direction.<ref>{{cite episode| title=Simon and Marcy| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Adam Muto & Nick Jennings (directors); Cole Sanchez & Rebecca Sugar (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=March 25, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 14}}</ref> This was the last episode of ''Adventure Time'' to feature Sugar as a storyboard artist. She left the series after this episode in order to focus her attention towards her own series, ''[[Steven_Universe|Steven Universe]]''. Sugar explained that she had been working on both ''Steven Universe'' and ''Adventure Time'', but by the time she was storyboarding "Simon and Marcy", she realized the workload was too much and that she had to step down from ''Adventure Time'' in order to focus on her own show.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title='Adventure Time' Writer Rebecca Sugar on 'Steven Universe,' Being Cartoon Network's First Female Show Creator And Why Pop Art Is 'Offensive'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/adventure-time-writer-rebecca-sugar-on-steven-universe|work=[[Indiewire|Indiewire]]|publisher=[[Snagfilms|Snagfilms]]|accessdate=December 23, 2013|date=November 1, 2013}}</ref> According to Sugar, Muto also contributed "additional scenes" to the episode; she wrote on her official [[Tumblr|Tumblr]] that "he really did a lot on this one and put it over the top."<ref name="tumblr"/> She also noted that "everyone [working on the series] was pitching in to make this one special".<ref name=tumblr/>

The episode features the voice of Ava Acres, who portrays the young version of Marceline.<ref name=avavoice/> Acres had previously appeared in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_3)|third season]] episode "Memory of a Memory".<ref name="memoryofamemory">{{cite episode| title=

According to Sugar's father, Rob, on his official YouTube channel, the use of the song started merely as a placeholder. However, as the episode developed, Sugar decided to keep it in the episode. This was notable, as it required that the show purchase the rights to use the original.<ref name=sugaryoutube>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rob|title='Bad Little Boy' Rebecca Sugar's Adventure Time Original Demo|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRVABjYg4V0|publisher=[[YouTube|YouTube]]|accessdate=February 19, 2013|date=February 19, 2013}}</ref> Muto later revealed that "According to Our New Arrivals", the theme from the sitcom ''[[Mr._Belvedere|Mr. Belvedere]]'', was also in the running.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muto|first=Adam|title=Why did you all choose 'No Wonder I' for 'Shh!'|url=http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/459905505490390363|publisher=[[Formspring|Formspring]]|accessdate=May 26, 2013|date=May 17, 2013}}</ref>

Critical reception to "Simon & Marcy" was overwhelmingly positive. Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode an "A", and wrote that "this episode is all about finding [a home] in a world that has been completely devastated."<ref name=avclub/> He was particularly pleased with the manner in which the episode balanced serious ideas with comedy, writing that—while the episode was not "super heavy" on laughs—humorous moments like Simon pushing the "Clambulance" off a bridge helped to "lighten the mood" in an otherwise dark episode.<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|last=Sava|first=Oliver|title='Simon And Marcy' {{!}} Adventure Time {{!}} TV Club|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/simon-and-marcy,93845/|work=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

After the episode aired, Eric Kohn of [[IndieWire|IndieWire]] published an article explaining why "'Adventure Time' is the best Sci-Fi show on TV right now". He praised the way in which the episode "deepen[ed] the world [of Ooo] in all kinds of morbidly fascinating ways."<ref name=indie/> Furthermore, he compared it to [[Cormac_McCarthy|Cormac McCarthy]]'s book ''[[The_Road|The Road]]'', specifically citing the similarities between the mutant creatures in the episode and the "demented people" in the latter.<ref name=indie/> Kohn ultimately concluded that the series' "willingness to contemplate [the themes of the episode] while sticking to its unique combination of silliness and haunting beauty routinely transforms the show into a wondrous genre experiment."<ref name=indie>{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title=Why 'Adventure Time' Is the Best Sci-Fi Show on TV Right Now|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/why-adventure-time-is-the-best-sci-fi-show-on-tv-right-now|work=[[IndieWire|IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Snagfilms|Snagfilms]]|accessdate=April 15, 2013|date=March 26, 2013}}</ref>

Kendra Beltran of [[MTV|MTV Geek]] wrote that the episode "pushed Ice King and Marceline's history even more into the pits of your heart and twisted it ever so."<ref name=mtv/> She ultimately concluded that the episode was "a touching notch in the ''Adventure Time'' realm".<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|last=Beltran|first=Kendra|title=Adventure Time Recap: Marceline Opens Up In 'Simon and Marcy'|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/?p=115562|work=[[MTV|MTV Geek]]|publisher=[[MTV|MTV]]|accessdate=April 15, 2013|date=March 26, 2013}}</ref> Novelist [[Lev_Grossman|Lev Grossman]], in an interview with [[NPR|NPR]] praised the backstory of the Ice King and the exploration of his condition, noting that his origin is "psychologically plausible".<ref name=npr/> Grossman praised the way the series was able to tackle the issues of mental illness, saying: "It's very affecting. My dad has been going through having Alzheimer's, and he's forgotten so much about who he used to be. And I look at him and think this cartoon is about my father dying."<ref name=npr>{{cite web|last=Ulaby|first=Neda|title=An 'Adventure' For Kids And Maybe For Their Parents, Too|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/monkeysee/2013/06/17/192385255/an-adventure-for-kids-and-maybe-for-their-parents-too?sc=tw&cc by doc"> share|publisher=[[NPR|NPR]]|accessdate=June 24, 2013|author2=Grossman, Lev |date=June 17, 2013}}</ref>
