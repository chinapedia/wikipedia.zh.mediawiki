<!--==劇情==
Finn and Jake venture to Tree Trunks’s (voiced by Polly Lou Livingston) house to acquire [[apple_pie|apple pie]]. While there, they discover that Tree Trunks has entered into a relationship with Mr. Pig (voiced by [[Ron_Lynch_(comedian)|Ron Lynch]]). Finn asks Tree Trunks if she would be willing to make apple pie for Princess Bubblegum’s musical concert, to which she agrees. Later at the concert, however, Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig arrive, sans apple pie. The two begin to passionately kiss, which makes the entire audience feel uncomfortable.

The two are told to stop showing public displays of affection, but they fail miserably. As a last-ditch effort, the two are separated from one another. Distressed, both perform the song “Dream of Love”, which details the sadness they feel about being separated from one another. The song is so moving that both Finn and Jake concede, allowing Tree Trunks and Mr. Pig to be reunited. Their relationship, however, still manages to disgust people, although Finn and Jake are beyond the point of worrying.

"Dream of Love" was written and storyboarded by Somvilay Xayaphone and Bert Youn, from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Dream of Love| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Somvilay Xayaphone & Bert Youn (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=April 23, 2012| season = 4 | number = 4}}</ref> Ward later noted in the DVD commentary that while the episode was fun to write, once the episode was finalized, the storyline involving kissing came out "weird" and "gross".<ref>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014.

Ron Lynch reprises his role as Mr. Pig in the episode; after the completion of "Apple Thief", Ward wanted Mr. Pig to come back because he felt that both the character and Lynch's voice acting were funny.<ref name=pigward>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014.

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode an "C–", noting that episode's plot was "juvenile" when compared to other ''Adventure Time'' episodes that deal with relationships.<ref name=avclubdream/> Despite this, Sava complimented the fact that the series was willing to explore the ideas that both public displays of affection can make people uncomfortable, but that people should not have to restrain their affection based on the whims of public. Sava also felt that the titular song was "an easy way of conveying a lot of feeling in a short amount of time".<ref name=avclubdream>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Adventure Time: 'Dream of Love'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-dream-of-love-72437|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

Mike Lechevaillier of ''[[Slate_(magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, in a review of the fourth season, argued that the episode "present[s] determinedly adult interrelations through the eyes of the inexperienced Finn" and delves "into the societal rift created by the public displays of affection between a tiny pachyderm and a pig (complete with [[Beat_Happening|Beat Happening]]-style musical number)."<ref name=season4slate/> Lechevaillier compared and contrasted the episode with the previous episode "[[Web_Weirdos|Web Weirdos]]", noting that both deal with relationships in different ways, "yet do so with such originality, humbleness, and poise that any viewer, from age six to 60, can find something to identify with."<ref name=season4slate>{{cite web|last=LeChevallier|first=Mike|title=Adventure Time: Season Four|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/adventure-time-season-four/328|work=[[Slate_(magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The_Washington_Post_Company|The Washington Post Company]]|accessdate=January 26, 2013|date=May 13, 2012}}</ref>
