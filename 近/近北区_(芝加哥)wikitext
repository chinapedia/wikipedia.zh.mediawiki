'''近北区'''（英語：'''Near North Side'''）是[[美国|美国]][[芝加哥|芝加哥]]的77个正式划分的社区（community areas）之一，位于[[芝加哥河|芝加哥河]]和[[中央商务区|中央商务区]][[卢普区|卢普区]]以北。

==街区==
<!-- ===Cabrini-Green===
{{main|Cabrini-Green}}
'''Cabrini-Green''' is one of the most notorious [[public_housing|public housing]] projects in the world. It 位于the North Side of Chicago, near the North/Clybourn [[Red_Line_(Chicago_Transit_Authority)|Red Line]] stop along with the Chicago and Sedgwick [[Brown_Line_(Chicago_Transit_Authority)|Brown Line]] stops. It is made up primarily of mid- and 高层公寓大楼，many with exterior porches so that residents enter their apartments like a motel room. Though Chicago has many housing projects with [[crime|crime]] problems, this one is the most noticeable because it is surrounded by wealthy neighborhoods, notably the Gold Coast and Lincoln Park just blocks away. In fact, residents of Gold Coast high-rise condos whose windows faced to the west could often see the flash of gunfire from Cabrini-Green.

公寓大楼 opened in 1958 (The "reds") and 1962 (The "whites"), while the rowhouses (called the Frances Cabrini Homes) opened in 1943. Cabrini-Green stands on top of what used to be an [[Italy|Italian]] slum called "Little [[Sicily|Sicily]]" or more sardonically, "Little Hell". -->

<!-- As gentrification began to take hold of the city in the early 1990's, the land on which Cabrini-Green sat on became extremely valuable, and one by one, the buildings have begun to meet the wrecking ball to make way for new development. Destruction of the "reds" began in 1995, and were all completely demolished by 2002. Only 3 of the "white" towers remain standing today, with plans to demolish them before the turn of the decade.

Low to midrise condominium buildings and rowhouses are being constructed, as the Chicago street grid is slowly rebuilt through the area. The redevelopment is riddled with controversy, as the residents are forced out of the complex to make way for the wealthy. Although 20% of the new units must be built as public housing, there is not enough supply to meet the demand for housing, and former residents of Cabrini-Green find themselves forced to less expensive areas of the city or to the suburbs. -->

===黄金海岸===
[[黃金海岸歷史地區_(芝加哥)|黄金海岸]]（Gold Coast）是芝加哥最富裕的街区之一，主要由湖滨大道（Lake Shore Drive）的高档公寓大楼组成，紧临[[密歇根湖|密歇根湖]]。<!-- but also including low-rise residential blocks inland. As with many neighborhoods, its exact borders are subject to dispute, but generally extend south to Oak and west to LaSalle, excluding the [[Carl_Sandburg_Village|Carl Sandburg Village]] housing development between LaSalle, Dearborn, Division, and North (located in Old Town & built as a buffer to encroaching blight in the 1960s).

1885年以前，黄金海岸还是一个普通的社区，那一年，前纺织品商人Potter Palmer and owner of the Palmer House hotel, built a fanciful castle on [[Lake_Shore_Drive|Lake Shore Drive]].在过去几十年间，芝加哥的精英阶层逐渐从[[Prairie_Avenue|Prairie Avenue]]移居到[[Chicago_Loop|Loop]]区以北的新家。

"黄金海岸Historic District" was listed on the [[National_Register_of_Historic_Places|National Register of Historic Places]] on [[January_30|January 30]], [[1978|1978]].

黄金海岸is zoned to the following [[Chicago_Public_Schools|Chicago Public Schools]] schools: [http://www.ogdenschool.org/ Ogden School] and [[Lincoln_Park_High_School_(Illinois)|Lincoln Park High School]]. -->
===鹅岛===
鹅岛（Goose Island）是芝加哥河上唯一的岛屿，它被芝加哥河的北支从西面，北支运河（the North Branch Canal）从东面与陆地隔开。运河由前芝加哥市长开挖于1853年。生產暢銷[[手工啤酒|手工啤酒]]「Goose Island 312」的鵝島釀酒廠（Goose Island Brewery）即以鵝島命名。
<!-- 檔案不存在 [[File:Updated_Goose_Island_logo.png|thumb]] ，可從英文維基百科取得 -->
<!-- [[William_B._Ogden|William B. Ogden]] for industrial purposes, thus forming the island. Because he formed the island, at times, it has been known as '''William B. Ogden Island'''.  After Irish imigrants moved to the island, it took on the name Goose Island as well as  '''Kilgubbin''', which was the immigrants' original home in Ireland.  The [[Goose_Island_Brewery|Goose Island Brewery]] makes Kilgubbin Red Ale, in honor of this name.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.gapersblock.com/airbags/archives/goose_island/ | title = Ask the Librarian: Goose Island | first = Alice | last = Maggio | work = Gapers Block | date = [[2005-05-26|2005-05-26]] | accessdate = 2007-05-17 }}</ref>
生產暢銷[[手工啤酒|手工啤酒]]「Goose Island 312」的鵝島釀酒廠（Goose Island Brewery）即以鵝島命名。

The large facility on the north end of the island (visible from North Avenue, but only reachable from the south: Division Street to North Branch to 1132 W. Blackhawk) is the [[Wrigley_Company|Wrigley]] Global Innovation Center, a 193,000 square foot facility, which opened in September 2005 and was designed by [[Gyo_Obata|Gyo Obata]] of [[Hellmuth_Obata_Kassabaum|Hellmuth Obata Kassabaum]].

On the south end of the island is [[Kendall_College|Kendall College]]'s Riverworks campus.

Since the sport of drifting has gotten more popularity through out chicago land area, so did goose island. When the sun goes down, the local drifters gather up to show off their new upgrades and get a few laps in before they are asked to leave by the chicago police department. -->
<!-- ===Magnificent Mile===
{{main|Magnificent Mile}}
The '''Magnificent Mile''' is a stretch of North Michigan Avenue between the Chicago River and [[Oak_Street_(Chicago)|Oak Street]]. Although actually about three-quarters of a mile, the name "Magnificent Mile" has stuck.

Along this street is a mixture of high-class stores, [[restaurant|restaurant]]s, office buildings and [[hotel|hotel]]s. The area has a high concentration of the city's major media firms and [[advertising_agency|advertising agencies]], including the ''[[Chicago_Tribune|Chicago Tribune]]'' [[newspaper|newspaper]].
[[File:Magnificent_Mile_from_Hancock_Observatory.jpg|thumb]]]]
It is the home of Chicago's famous [[Chicago_Water_Tower|Water Tower]] landmark, Water Tower Park with its historic clock, and the eight-level [[Water_Tower_Place|Water Tower Place]] shopping center which grew up next door to, and overshadowed, the comparatively diminutive landmark. The shopping center is anchored by two [[department_store|department store]]s: [[Macy's|Macy's]] North Michigan store and [[Lord_&_Taylor|Lord & Taylor]]. North of the shopping center can be found the famous [[John_Hancock_Center|John Hancock Center]], the [[art_deco|art deco]] [[Palmolive_Building|Palmolive Building]] and the lavish [[Drake_Hotel|Drake Hotel]]. -->
===河北===
河北（River North）是近北区的一个社区。它的边界为东到Rush街，北到芝加哥大街（Chicago Avenue），南面和西面到芝加哥河。这个社区集中了美国除曼哈顿以外最多的画廊。同时，这个社区还拥有许多酒吧、舞蹈俱乐部、受欢迎的餐厅、和娱乐场所。河北又可以细分为：
*画廊区，<!-- primarily along Superior and Huron streets between Wells and Orleans; -->
*餐馆区，拥有许多服务游客的餐馆；<!-- 环绕Clark and Ontario; -->
*“座堂区”，拥有许多新建的住宅[[摩天大楼|摩天大楼]]，环绕着罗马天主教[[芝加哥圣名主教座堂|芝加哥圣名主教座堂]]（Holy Name Cathedral, Chicago）和圣公会的[[芝加哥圣雅各座堂|芝加哥圣雅各座堂]]（St. James Cathedral, Chicago）；<!-- 都坐落在靠近 State and Huron; --> 
*设计区，有出售豪华家具的店铺、陈列室。<!-- in the blocks north of the [[Merchandise_Mart|Merchandise Mart]]; --> 
<!-- * Kingsbury Park, an area of newly built residential high-rises surrounding Kingsbury Park, at Erie Street and 芝加哥河。 -->
===河西===
河西（River West）是近北区西部的一个社区。它的边界为北到芝加哥大街（Chicago Avenue），西到[[Kennedy_Expressway|I-90/94]]，南到俄亥俄街，东到[[芝加哥河|芝加哥河]]。
<!-- ===Streeterville===
'''Streeterville'''是位于芝加哥河以北的一个社区。它的边界为南到芝加哥河，[[Michigan_Avenue_(Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] on the west, and Lake Michigan on the north and east, and is located east of [[Chicago_(CTA_Red_Line)|Chicago]] and [[Grand_(CTA_Red_Line)|Grand]] stations of the [[Red_Line_(Chicago_Transit_Authority)|Red Line]]. The [[Land_reclamation|reclaimed land]] on which the neighborhood is built owes its existence, solely, to [[George_Streeter|George Streeter]]. In the late 1880s, George 'Cap' Streeter's boat hit a sandbar just off the shoreline and there it stayed; he and his wife made this their new home. The Streeters encouraged dumping in this area and, after several years, the debris built up and became solid land. George claimed this 'new land' as an independent territory in respect to an 1821 government survey that declared Chicago, and Illinois, property lines terminated at the shoreline. Under his homesteading rights as a Civil War Veteran, he declared the new land to be the District of Lake Michigan. Naturally, the powers that be eventually got around to seizing this land by force, and it is now home to some of the most expensive real estate in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thelocaltourist.com/articles/streeterville.htm | title = Streeterville: From Sandbar to Prime Real Estate | work = thelocaltourist.com | publisher = The Local Tourist, Inc. | first = Theresa | last = Carter | year = 2007 | accessdate = 2007-05-17 }}</ref>

Streeterville houses some of Chicago's tallest [[skyscrapers|skyscrapers]] and most upscale stores, hotels, restaurants and theaters, as well as [[Northwestern_University|Northwestern University]]'s [[Feinberg_School_of_Medicine|Feinberg School of Medicine]] and [[Northwestern_University_School_of_Law|School of Law]]. The Magnificent Mile portion of Michigan Avenue is part of Streeterville, as is the number one tourist attraction in Chicago, [[Navy_Pier|Navy Pier]]. -->
===华盛顿广场===
{{main|Washington Square Park, Chicago}}
<!-- 华盛顿广场是一个位于is a public square bounded by Dearborn, Clark, Delaware, and Walton streets. It was long known as "Bughouse Square," as orators of varying abilities often used its central platform for speeches. It is fronted on the north by [[Newberry_Library|Newberry Library]] and partially bounded by the [http://www.ci.chi.il.us/Landmarks/W/WashingtonSq.html Washington Square landmark district]. Immediately west of LaSalle Boulevard, separating this area from Cabrini-Green, is the [[Moody_Bible_Institute|Moody Bible Institute]], and immediately east is Connors Park.

Census tract 811, a four-block (0.04 sq. mi.) area located between State, Dearborn, Chicago, and Division and straddling Washington Square and the Gold Coast, had 3,718 residents in 2000, giving it a population density of 90,614.2 people per square mile — the highest in Chicago. -->

<!-- ===Connors Park===
Named after a small, triangular park bounded by Rush, Wabash, Chestnut, and Delaware, this small part of the Magnificent Mile district (west of Michigan, north of Chicago, east of State, and south of Oak) has recently gained attention due to new development spilling over from Michigan Avenue. Much of  [[Loyola_University_Chicago|Loyola University Chicago]] Water Tower campus lies in this area. -->
