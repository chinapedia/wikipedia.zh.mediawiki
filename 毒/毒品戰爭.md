=== 20th century ===
The first U.S. law that restricted the distribution and use of certain drugs was the [[Harrison_Narcotics_Tax_Act|Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914. The first local laws came as early as 1860.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/heroin/etc/history.html |title=Opium Throughout History |publisher=PBS Frontline |accessdate=2010-10-08}}</ref> In 1919, the United States passed the [[美國憲法第十八修正案|18th Amendment]], prohibiting the sale, manufacture, and transportation of [[乙醇|alcohol]], with exceptions for religious and medical use. In 1920, the United States passed the [[National_Prohibition_Act|National Prohibition Act]] (Volstead Act), enacted to carry out the provisions in law of the 18th Amendment.

The [[Federal_Bureau_of_Narcotics|Federal Bureau of Narcotics]] was established in the [[美国财政部|United States Department of the Treasury]] by an act of June 14, 1930 (46 Stat. 585).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/170.html#170.3 |title=Records of the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA |publisher=Archives.gov |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref> In 1933, [[禁酒時期|the federal prohibition for alcohol]] was repealed by passage of the [[美利坚合众国宪法第二十一条修正案|21st Amendment]]. In 1935, President [[富兰克林·德拉诺·罗斯福|Franklin D. Roosevelt]] publicly supported the adoption of the [[Uniform_State_Narcotic_Drug_Act|Uniform State Narcotic Drug Act]]. ''[[纽约时报|The New York Times]]'' used the headline "Roosevelt Asks Narcotic War Aid".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.net/schaffer/History/e1930/rooseveltasks.htm |title=ROOSEVELT ASKS NARCOTIC WAR AID, 1935 |publisher=Druglibrary.net |accessdate=2011-03-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=15024 |title=Letter to the World Narcotic Defense Association.

In 1937, the [[Marihuana_Tax_Act_of_1937|Marihuana Tax Act of 1937]] was passed.

<blockquote>"The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs?

In 1973, the [[美国缉毒局|Drug Enforcement Administration]] was created to replace the [[麻醉药物和危险药物管理局|Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs]].<ref name="frontline" />

The Nixon Administration also repealed the federal 2–10-year [[mandatory_sentencing|mandatory minimum sentences]] for  possession of marijuana and started federal demand reduction programs and drug-treatment programs. [[Robert_DuPont|Robert DuPont]], the "Drug czar" in the Nixon Administration, stated it would be more accurate to say that Nixon ended, rather than launched, the "war on drugs".

The [[Global_Commission_on_Drug_Policy|Global Commission on Drug Policy]] released a report on June 2, 2011 alleging that "The War On Drugs Has Failed".

On May 21, 2012, the U.S. Government published an updated version of its Drug Policy.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/policy-and-research/principles-of-modern-drug-policy Principles of Modern Drug Policy]. Whitehouse.gov.</ref> The director of [[ONDCP|ONDCP]] stated simultaneously that this policy is something different from the "War on Drugs":
* The U.S Government sees the policy as a "third way" approach to drug control; an approach that is based on the results of a huge investment in research from some of the world's preeminent scholars on disease of substance abuse.
* The policy does not see drug legalization as the "silver bullet" solution to drug control.
* It is not a policy where success is measured by the number of arrests made or prisons built.<ref>[http://www.whitehouse.gov/ondcp/news-releases-remarks/principles-of-modern-drug-policy-directors-remarks-at-the-world-federation-against-drugs Statement of the Government of the United States of America World Federation Against Drugs 3rd World Forum, May 21, 2012, Stockholm, Sweden].

At the same meeting was a declaration signed by the representatives of Italy, the Russian Federation, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States in line with this:
"Our approach must be a balanced one, combining effective enforcement to restrict the supply of drugs, with efforts to reduce demand and build recovery; supporting people to live a life free of addiction".<ref>[http://www.wfad.se/images/articles/Final_statement_WFAD.pdf Joint statement For a humane and balanced drug policy, Stockholm 20 May 2012].
