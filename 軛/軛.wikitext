'''軛'''是一種用木製造的[[梁|梁]]，擱套在兩頭牛或其他牲口的頸背部，用來給成對工作的牲口共同拉一負載；某些軛的設計，也適用於個別單一牲口。軛可以用來幫助犁田、拉車。軛有幾種類型，用於不同的文化，或不同類型的牛使用；東亞的軛常為曲木。<!--   A pair of oxen is also called a ''yoke of oxen'', and yoke is also used as a verb: "to ''yoke'' a pair of oxen". -->

軛也使用於其他動物，如馬、騾、驢、水牛等。

"yoke" 被認為是來自[[原始印歐語|原始印歐語]]*yugóm (yoke)，從動詞* yeug - (join, unite)。這詞根在幾乎所有已知的[[印歐語系|印歐語系]]有後裔，包括[[德語|德語]]Joch、[[拉丁語|拉丁語]]iugum、[[古希臘語|古希臘語]]  ζυγόν（zygon）、[[梵語|梵語]]युग（yugá）、[[赫梯語|赫梯語]] 𒄿𒌑𒃷（iúkan）、[[古教會斯拉夫語|古教會斯拉夫語]]иго（igo）、[[立陶宛語|立陶宛語]]jungas、[[古愛爾蘭語|古愛爾蘭語]]cuing、[[羅馬尼亞語|羅馬尼亞語]]jug等。（全部解作“yoke”）

頸軛是綁在一對牛的脖子上的木製橫檔（偶爾在馬上）。<!-- It is held on the animals' necks by an [[oxbow|oxbow]], from which it gets its name.  The oxbow is usually U-shaped and also transmits force from the animals' shoulders. A swivel between the animals, beneath the centre of the yoke, attaches to the pole of a vehicle or to chains ([[trace_(tack)|trace]]s) used to drag a load. -->
頸軛在[[北歐|北歐]]、[[美國|美國]]、[[澳洲|澳洲]]和[[非洲|非洲]]使用。

==頭軛==
[[File:Zugochsen.jpg|thumb]]
頭軛配置在牛頭，通常在[[牛角|牛角]]後方。<!-- and has carved-out sections into which the horns fit; it may be a single beam attached to both oxen, or each ox may have a separate short beam (see picture).  The yoke is then strapped to the horns of the oxen with yoke straps.   Some types fit instead onto the front of the head, again strapped to the horns, and ox pads are then used for cushioning the oxen's foreheads.  A tug pole is held to the bottom of the yoke using yoke irons and chains. The tug pole can either be a short pole with a chain attached for hauling, or a long pole with a hook on the end that has no chain at all. Sometimes the pole is attached to a wagon and the oxen are simply backed over this pole, the pole is then raised between them and a backing bolt is dropped into the chains on the yoke irons in order to haul the wagon. --> 

頭軛廣泛用於在[[南歐|南歐]]、大部分[[南美|南美]]地區和[[加拿大|加拿大]]。

==肩隆軛==

肩隆軛是用在牛的[[肩隆|肩隆]]前。<!-- The yoke is held in position by straps, either alone or with a pair of wooden staves either side of the ox's withers; the pull is however from the yoke itself, not from the staves.  Withers yokes particularly suit [[zebu|zebu]] cattle, which have high humps on their withers. -->

==比較==
<!-- Although all three yoke types are effective, each has its advantages and disadvantages.  As mentioned above, withers yokes suit zebu cattle, and head yokes can of course only be used for animals with suitable horns.  Head yokes need to be re-shaped frequently to fit the animals' horns as they grow; unlike the other types they fix the animal's heads apart (when a single beam), helping the oxen to stand quietly without fighting.  Bow yokes need to be the correct size for the animal (new ones are often made as the animal grows), but they need no adjustment in use. -->
