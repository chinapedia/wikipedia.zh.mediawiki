;早年
Mackay began his career in his native [[Scotland|Scotland]], coming through the youth ranks of [[Queen's_Park_F.C.|Queen's Park]], before joining Scottish giants [[Celtic_F.C.|Celtic]] in the summer of 1993. He made  46 appearances in 5 years with the [[Glasgow|Glasgow]] club, and in September 1998 moved to England, joining [[Norwich_City_F.C.|Norwich City]] for a fee of £350,000 after a one-game loan spell.<ref name=soccerbase>{{Cite web|url=http://www.soccerbase.com/players/player.sd?player_id=9397|title=Malky Mackay|publisher=[[Racing_Post|Racing Post]]|work=[[Soccerbase|Soccerbase]]|accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref>

;諾域治
At the end of the [[2001-02_in_English_football|2001–02]] season Norwich fans voted Mackay in second place behind [[Gary_Holt_(footballer)|Gary Holt]] in the voting for [[Norwich_City_player_of_the_year|Norwich City player of the year]]. In the [[2003-04_in_English_football|2003–04]] season, his sixth at Norwich, the club was promoted to the [[FA_Premier_League|Premier League]] after winning [[Football_League_Division_One|Division One]], however he was released by Norwich at the end of the season. He was named in the [[Football_League_First_Division|Football League First Division]] Team of the Year in the 2003–04 in which they got promoted. Arguably Mackay's most famous moment at Norwich was during a local derby against Ipswich Town, in which he scored two goals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/page/NewsDetail/0,,10400~1369450,00.html|title=Three's the magic number for Mackay|publisher=Watford Football Club|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=18 August 2008}}</ref>

;韋斯咸
Mackay signed for [[West_Ham_United_F.C.|West Ham United]], before getting a chance to play in the [[FA_Premier_League|Premier League]], for £300,000 on 10 September 2004. He played 18 league games for the Hammers, although none after March, as West Ham reached the play-offs, beating [[Preston_North_End_F.C.|Preston North End]] in the final to reach the Premier League. Mackay was released before playing a top flight game.<ref name=soccerbase/>

;屈福特
Mackay was picked up on a free transfer by [[Aidy_Boothroyd|Aidy Boothroyd]] as part of his rebuilding of [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] and soon become one of the key figures in Boothroyd's side. Mackay's experience was an invaluable asset to [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] and alongside [[Clarke_Carlisle|Clarke Carlisle]] and [[Jay_Demerit|Jay Demerit]], Mackay was involved in some fantastic defensive displays as well as scoring some vital goals, including one against [[Luton_Town_F.C._and_Watford_F.C._rivalry|fierce rivals]] [[Luton_Town_F.C.|Luton Town]] at [[Kenilworth_Road|Kenilworth Road]] in a 2–1 victory.<ref>{{Citenews|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4560238.stm|title=Luton 1–2 Watford|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=2 January 2006}}</ref> At the end of the [[2005-06_in_English_football|2005–06 season]] Mackay achieved the feat of being promoted to the [[Premier_League|Premier League]] for the third successive season, as [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] defeated [[Leeds_United_A.F.C.|Leeds United]] 3–0 in the [[2006_Football_League_Championship_play-off_Final|play-off final]].<ref>{{citenews|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4771857.stm|title=Leeds 0–3 Watford|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=21 May 2006}}</ref>

After having been released following his two previous promotion campaigns, Mackay was assured by Boothroyd that he would play a part in Watford's Premier League campaign, citing his experience as an important asset to the team. Although he was not a first-team regular, Mackay made 14 Premier League appearances in [[2006-07_Watford_F.C._season|2006–07]]. In January 2007, Mackay took his first step into coaching by being promoted to first team coach, following the departure of [[Dave_Hockaday|Dave Hockaday]].<ref>{{Citenews|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-428256/Hockaday-feels-Hornets-sting.html|title=Hockaday feels Hornets' sting|work=[[Daily_Mail|Daily Mail]]|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=11 January 2007|first=Neil|last=Ashton}}</ref>

In the [[2007-08_in_English_football|2007–08]] season Mackay's only first team appearance came during an [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] tie against [[Wolves_F.C.|Wolves]] in January 2008. He took over as [[caretaker_manager|caretaker manager]] at Watford on 4 November 2008 following the departure of [[Aidy_Boothroyd|Aidy Boothroyd]].<ref name="Boothroyd needed break - Simpson">{{cite news|title=Boothroyd needed break – Simpson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/7707938.stm|publisher=[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]|date=4 November 2008|accessdate=5 February 2011}}</ref> but his spell in charge lasted just 5 games after former [[Chelsea_F.C.|Chelsea]] reserve coach [[Brendan_Rodgers|Brendan Rodgers]] was appointed on a long term basis by then Watford chairman [[Graham_Simpson_(businessman)|Graham Simpson]].

During his sixth and final season at [[Norwich_City_F.C.|Norwich]], at the age of 32, Mackay became the oldest man to make his debut for [[Scotland_national_football_team|Scotland]] in 37 years.<ref>{{citenews|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1351582/Malky-Mackay-He-came-hard-way-preaches-beautiful-game.html|title=The Real Mackay: He came up the hard way but preaches the beautiful game... meet Malky Mackay|work=[[Daily_Mail|Daily Mail]]|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=29 January 2011|first=Ivan|last=Speck}}</ref> It came in a 1–0 defeat to [[Denmark_national_football_team|Denmark]]; Mackay later played in a 1–0 victory over [[Estonia_national_football_team|Estonia]] and a 4–1 win against [[Trinidad_and_Tobago_national_football_team|Trinidad & Tobago]]. In total, Mackay won five caps for Scotland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/football_player_profile.cfm?page=823&playerID=13629&CFID=1540811&CFTOKEN=30413448|title=Malky Mackay- A squad|publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=16 October 2009}}</ref>

After [[Brendan_Rodgers|Brendan Rodgers]] resigned in June 2009, Mackay took over as the manager of Watford. Watford drew 1–1 on their league visit to Reading on 26 September 2009, and by their second meeting late in the season Rodgers had been dismissed by Reading after only a few months in charge.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8263718.stm|title=Reading 1–1 Watford|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=26 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/r/reading/8417263.stm|title=Boss Brendan Rodgers leaves Reading by mutual consent|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=17 December 2009}}</ref> As for Mackay and Watford, [[2009–10_Watford_F.C._season|2009–10]] was a difficult season where their Championship status was under threat for a long time, but by the end of April survival had been achieved, ironically against Reading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8633300.stm|title=Watford 3–0 Reading|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=24 April 2010}}</ref>

During the [[2010–11_Watford_F.C._season|2010–11 season]], Mackay was linked with the assistant manager's job at Premier League side Newcastle United, as well as with the managers job at fellow Championship side Burnley.<ref>{{Citenews|url=http://www.watfordobserver.co.uk/sport/watfordfc/watfordfcnews/8776162._Malky_is_fundamental_to_what_we_re_building_/?action=complain&cid=9043671|title=Chief executive says Watford would not welcome approach from likes of Burnley and Newcastle United|work=[[Watford_Observer|Watford Observer]]|accessdate=5 February 2011|date=7 January 2011|first=Frank|last=Smith}}</ref> In March 2011, Mackay, along with assistant manager [[Sean_Dyche|Sean Dyche]], signed a deal at Watford to extend their respective tenures at the club by a further three-and-a-half years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watford boss Malky Mackay agrees new deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/watford/9414594.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=4 March 2011|date=4 March 2011}}</ref> Watford ended the season 14th in the Football League Championship.
