Born in [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton-on-Tees]] and raised in [[Eaglescliffe|Eaglescliffe]], Bates began playing at [[Manchester_United|Manchester United]]'s centre of excellence in [[Birtley,_Tyne_and_Wear|Birtley]] since the age of nine. Several years later, the centre was closed down and he was taken in by his hometown club [[Middlesbrough_F.C.|Middlesbrough]]. After tasting [[FA_Youth_Cup|FA Youth Cup]] success in 2003–04, he was promoted to the first team and made his debut on 6 December 2004, coming on as an injury time replacement for [[Jimmy_Floyd_Hasselbaink|Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink]] in a 3–2 win over [[Manchester_City_F.C.|Manchester City]]. After a successful loan spell at [[Darlington_F.C.|Darlington]], he made a breakthrough, making 28 appearances and played alongside former manager [[Gareth_Southgate|Gareth Southgate]] in central defence.<ref>{{citenews|title=Saturday Spotlight Survival would complete Bates' recovery|url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/archive/2009/04/25/Sport%3A+Football+%28Middlesbrough+News%29/4319793.Saturday_Spotlight __Survival_would_complete_Bates____recovery/|publisher=[[Darlington_&_Stockton_Times|Darlington & Stockton Times]]|date=25 April 2009}}</ref>

Bates had been tipped by some to be Southgate's successor but an injury while on loan at [[Ipswich_Town_F.C.|Ipswich]] in November 2006 prematurely ended his 2006–07 season. He was seriously injured in his second game, tearing his [[cruciate_ligament|cruciate ligament]] and partially tearing his [[medial_ligament|medial ligament]], and returned to Boro.<ref>[http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,1~934131,00.html "Cruel blow for Matthew"], Middlesbourgh Football Club (undated).</ref> After recovering in January 2008, Bates moved on loan to [[Norwich_City_F.C.|Norwich City]] for two months. He later returned to Middlesbrough after suffering from another knee injury which has resulted in him needing an operation for the third time in just 18 months.<ref>[http://www.canaries.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetails/0,,10355~1229256,00.html "City sign Bates on loan"], Norwich City Football Club, 30 January 2008.</ref> He scored his first league goal for Middlesbrough in a crucial 3–1 win over relegation rivals Hull on 11 April 2009.<ref>{{cite web

Following Middlesbrough's relegation from the [[Premier_League|Premier League]] in the [[Middlesbrough_F.C._season_2008–09|2008–09 season]], rumours arose regarding his future with them. However, despite a number of Premier League clubs being interested, he opted to stay at Middlesbrough signed a new three-year deal at the Riverside outfit.<ref>[http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11680_5395365,00.html "Bates pens Boro deal: Middlesbrough ace signs on for three more years"], ''Sky Sports'', 22 June 2009.</ref>

On 25 July, Bates suffered the fourth serious knee injury of his career and could be sidelined for the rest of the year.<ref>Richardson, Andy (27 July 2009). [http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/sport/4513730.Bates_knee_injury_is_huge_blow_for_Boro/ "Bates knee injury is huge blow for Boro"]. [[The_Northern_Echo|The Northern Echo]]</ref> He went for surgery in September and is confirmed to be out for the entire season.<ref>{{citenews|title=Bates heads to the USA in latest fightback|url=http://www.darlingtonandstocktontimes.co.uk/archive/2009/11/24/Sport%3A+Football+%28Middlesbrough+News%29/4756270.Bates_heads_to_USA_in_latest_fightback/|publisher=[[Darlington_&_Stockton_Times|Darlington & Stockton Times]]|date=24 November 2009}}</ref>

The 2010/11 season saw Bates as a regular in the Boro line-up. He got his first goal of the season against [[Portsmouth_F.C.|Portsmouth]] in a 2-2 draw. Under new Boro manager [[Tony_Mowbray|Tony Mowbray]] Bates was named new captain. He scored the only goal in a 1-1 draw with [[Preston_North_End_F.C.|Preston North End]]. His third and final goal of the season came when he returned to the side after injury, playing in midfield, against [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United]]. He was rewarded with a great start to the 2011/12 season by winning Player of the Month.
