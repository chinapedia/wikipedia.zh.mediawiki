==Concepts and issues==
Key concepts of Marxist sociology include: [[historical_materialism|historical materialism]], [[mode_of_production|mode of production]], the relation between [[Capital_(economics)|capital]] and [[labour_(economics)|labour]].<ref name=encofsoc/> Marxist sociology is significantly concerned, but not limited to, the relations between society and economics.<ref name=section/> Key questions asked by Marxist sociology include:<ref name=black/>
* how does the capital control the workers?
* how does the mode of production influence the [[social_class|social class]]?
* what is the relation between workers, capital, the [[State_(polity)|state]] and our [[culture|culture]]?
* how do economic factors influence inequalities, including those related to [[gender|gender]] and [[race_(classification_of_human_beings)|race]]?

Within the field of [[sociological_theory|sociological theory]], Marxist sociology, recognized as one of the major [[sociological_paradigms|sociological paradigms]], is associated with [[conflict_theory|conflict]] and [[critical_theory|critical theories]].<ref name=black/>

Compared to [[Marxism|Marxism]], Marxist sociology has proven to put relatively little weight on making [[class_revolution|class revolution]].<ref name=black/>

Compared with [[Marxist_philosophy|Marxist philosophy]], Marxist sociology aims to develop an objective, [[political_economy|political economic science]] of society instead of a critical philosophy of [[praxis|praxis]].<ref name=encofsoc/>

Compared with [[economic_sociology|economic sociology]], Marxist sociology can be seen as a subset of that field, influenced by [[Marxism|Marxism]].

==Historical development==
Marxist sociology emerged around late 19th/early 20th century, influenced by the thought of [[Karl_Marx|Karl Marx]].<ref name=black/><ref name=encofsoc/><ref name=dictbot>Tom B. Bottomore, ''A Dictionary of Marxist thought'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1991 (2nd ed.), ISBN 0631180826, [http://books.google.com/books?id=q4QwNP_K1pYC&pg=PA506&dq=%22Marxist+sociology%22&as_brr=3&ei=_WBNSpPLAoSszgSf2cz0Ag Google Print, 505-508]</ref> Marx is seen as one of the most influential thinkers in [[history_of_sociology|early sociology]], alongside thinkers such as [[Max_Weber|Max Weber]] and [[Émile_Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]].<ref name=dictbot/> The first Marxist school of sociology was known as the [[Austro-Marxism|Austro-Marxism]] and notable Marxist thinkers of that period included [[Carl_Grünberg|Carl Grünberg]] and [[Antonio_Labriola|Antonio Labriola]].<ref name=dictbot/> Much of the development in the field of Marxist sociology occurred on the outskirts of academia, and some pitted Marxist sociology against the "[[bourgeois|bourgeois]] sociology".<ref name=dictbot/>

For a while, this division was reinforced by the Marxism-inspired [[October_Revolution|Russian Revolution]], which led to the creation of the [[Soviet_Union|Soviet Union]]; soon, however, sociology found itself a victim of the [[Suppressed_research_in_the_Soviet_Union#Sociology|suppression of "bourgeois" science]] in the communist states.<ref name=dictbot/> While after several decades sociology was reestablished under communist states, two separate currents of thought evolved within Marxist sociology: the [[Soviet_Marxism|Soviet Marxism]], developed in the 20th century communist states (primarily in the [[Soviet_Union|Soviet Union]]), serving the state's interests, and significantly crippled by forced adherence to the [[dogma|dogma]] of [[historical_materialism|historical materialism]], and the more independent school centered around the studies of Marxism in [[Western_world|the West]].<ref name=black/><ref name=encofsoc/> The [[Western_Marxism|Western Marxist]] school (around 1940s) became accepted within Western academia, and over time fractured into several different perspectives, such as the [[Frankfurt_School|Frankfurt School]] or the school of [[critical_theory|critical theory]].<ref name=black/>

In [[post-communist|post-communist]] states there has been a backlash against the Marxist thought due to its former state-supported favored position (see for example [[sociology_in_Poland|sociology in Poland]]), but the Marxist thought is still dominant in the sociological research in the remaining communist countries (see for example [[sociology_in_China|sociology in China]]).-->
