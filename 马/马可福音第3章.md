'''马可福音3章'''是《[[新约圣经|新约圣经]]·[[马可福音|马可福音]]》的第三章，包括了在[[安息日|安息日]]治病的冲突、[[耶稣|耶稣]]选立[[十二使徒|十二使徒]]，与经学家的冲突，以及与家人的冲突。

== 医治萎缩的手 ==
{{seealso|耶稣的神迹}}

接着[[马可福音2章|马可福音2章]]中安息日的话题，马可福音3章开始于耶稣安息日在犹太会堂中治愈一个人萎缩的手。马可使用了副词“又”，表明这是与1章21-28节同一个会堂。<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref>根据马可的记载，有一些人在那里等待，想看耶稣是否在安息日医治那人，以便抓到把柄来控告他。当时的拉比允许在安息日治疗有严重危险的病人。<!-- a situation his hand would not qualify for.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref> 犹太百科全书 article on [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=254&letter=J&search=Jesus Jesus] notes: "...stricter rabbis allowed only the saving of life to excuse the slightest curtailment of the Sabbath rest (Shab. xxii. 6)." -->

耶稣问群众：“在安息日哪样是可以的：行善还是作恶，拯救生命还是杀害生命？”<!-- ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:4|31}})  They do not answer and he angrily looks around at the crowd and is "distressed at their stubborn hearts", ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:5|31}}).  He tells the man to put out his hand which he does and then, seemingly instantaneously, it is healed.  Many other stories of healing at the time involved the healer doing work in some way to effect a cure as compared to this quick almost effortless action here.<ref>Kilgallen 63</ref>  Mark could be highlighting how great he viewed Jesus' powers as being.<ref>Kilgallen 63</ref>  Jesus also equates not doing good with doing evil and says it is more important, even or perhaps especially, to not let evil and suffering occur through inaction.<ref>Kilgallen 66-67</ref> -->

根据马可的记载，这个神迹被[[法利赛人|法利赛人]]和[[希律党|希律党]]人抓住，当作把柄，来对付耶稣，准备将他置于死地。<!-- Thus the reaction of a substantial number of [[Jews|Jews]] has gone from being amazed to one of outright opposition.  Mark has already begun to foreshadow Jesus' death, with this as well as the saying -->关于新郎和禁食在{{bibleverse||马可福音|2:19-20|31}}.<ref>Kilgallen 67</ref> 有些人发现这两批人几乎不可能在一起，因为法利赛人反对[[罗马帝国|罗马帝国]]及其傀儡希律。马可的描写反映他们的双重性格，以及反对耶稣的迫切愿望，使他们有了共同的目标。<ref>Kilgallen 68-69</ref>    

此事同样发生于[[马太福音|马太福音]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=12&version=31 12:9-14]<!-- , although Jesus asks about how one would save a sheep on the Sabbath and how helping a person is more important than helping a sheep.  [[路加福音|路加福音]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&chapter=6&version=31 6:6-11] is almost the same as this section of Mark although Luke does not state that they planned to kill him, only that they were "furious" and talked about what to do about Jesus. -->

[[Image:Healing_of_the_demon-possessed.jpg|right]]

<!-- Jesus then "withdraws", ''anechōrēsen'', and goes down by a lake, presumably the [[加利利海|加利利海]], and people follow him there.  Some see the word as meaning flight as it comes after Mark talks about the plot against Jesus, but it could just as easily mean leaving [[Capernaum|Capernaum]] to go to the sea.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref>  Mark says the people had come from "...[[Judea|Judea]], [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], [[Edom|Idumea]], and the regions across the [[Jordan_river|Jordan]] and around [[Tyre,_Lebanon|Tyre]] and [[Sidon|Sidon]]." ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:8|31}})  Mark thus shows that people are coming from many areas, not just [[Galilee|Galilee]].  Whether these people were non-Jews is unclear as the non-Jewish areas listed also contained Jewish populations.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref>  Another group of the time to consider is the Jewish [[Proselytes|Proselytes]]. He has the [[Disciple_(Christianity)|disciples]] prepare a boat for him to avoid "crowding" because "... he had healed many, so that those with diseases were pushing forward to touch him." ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:10|31}}) and then he heals many of the sick.  [[Demonic_possession|Evil (or unclean) spirits in the people]] brought before him fall down and call him the [[Son_of_God|Son of God]], but he tells them not to tell people who he is, continuing the theme of the [[Messianic_Secret|Messianic Secret]]. -->

== 选立十二使徒 ==
{{seealso|十二使徒}}

马可记载道，耶稣在避开了跟随他的群众之后，上了一座山，呼召他的十二名门徒，将他们设立为使徒，赐给他们传道和[[驱魔|驱魔]]的能力。有些抄本没有提到耶稣称他们为使徒{{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:14|31}}。<!--Verse {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|6:30}} may be the only time he uses the word, which is most frequently (68 out of 79) used by [[Luke_the_Evangelist|Luke the Evangelist]] and [[Paul_of_Tarsus|Paul of Tarsus]], see [http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/words.pl?word=652 Strong's G652]. It is perhaps symbolic that this occurs on a mountain, a height where people can be met by God in the Jewish tradition,<ref>Kilgallen 71</ref> such as [[Moses|Moses]] talking to God on [[Mount_Sinai|Mount Sinai]], see also the [[Sermon_on_the_Mount|Sermon on the Mount]].  Mark pictures Jesus as drawing large multitudes to his teaching, and shifts from mountains to lakes to houses at will, creating an evocotive landscape that some find lacking plausibility,<ref>Miller 19</ref> although the area contains such geographic features. -->

<!-- He appoints Simon, called [[彼得|彼得]], [[James,_son_of_Zebedee|James]], [[John_the_Apostle|John]], [[Saint_Andrew|Andrew]], [[Philip_the_Apostle|Philip]], [[Saint_Bartholomew|Bartholomew]], [[Saint_Matthew|Matthew]], [[Thomas_(Apostle)|Thomas]], a second [[James,_son_of_Alphaeus|James]], [[Saint_Thaddaeus|Thaddaeus]], [[St._Simon|Simon]] whom Mark calls a [[Zealot|Zealot]], and lastly [[Judas_Iscariot|Judas Iscariot]].  

Luke's lists in Luke {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|6:12-16|31}} and [[Acts_of_the_Apostles|Acts of the Apostles]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|1:13|31}} do not list a Thaddaeus but instead list "Judas, son of James" or "[[Jude,_brother_of_Jesus|Judas the brother of James]]" in the [[KJV|KJV]] ({{bibleverse||Luke|6:16|KJV}}), which some have asserted are two names for the same person, [[Jude_Thaddaeus|Jude Thaddaeus]]. Luke also has the story of the [[Seventy_Disciples|Seventy Disciples]].  Matthew's list is the same as Mark in {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|10:1-4|31}}, although a few [[Western_text-type|western manuscripts]] of Matthew have a [[Lebbaeus|Lebbaeus]].<ref>Brown 130</ref>  This might also indicate that by the time of the writing of the Gospels the exact recollection of the "minor" Apostles had become uncertain, and that there is no "Jude Thaddaeus", a creation of later [[hagiography|hagiography]].<ref>Brown 130</ref>  [[Gospel_of_John|John]] lists no Bartholomew, although John's [[Nathanael|Nathanael]] is usually equated with him. -->

<!-- Mark says that the brothers James and John were given the title ''[[Aramaic_of_Jesus#Boanerges_.28.CE.92.CE.BF.CE.B1.CE.BD.CE.B7.CF.81.CE.B3.CE.B5.CF.82.29|Boanerges]]'', which Mark tells us means "Sons of Thunder", although many modern scholars disagree with this translation.<ref>Kilgallen 70</ref>  Many explanations have been given for this title but none commands a consensus.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 604</ref>  Why Jesus gave Simon the name Peter, meaning rock, Mark does not say.  {{bibleverse||Matthew|16:18|31}} has his naming in connection with the church and {{bibleverse||John|1:42|31}} has it relate to his character.  It could also have an ironic meaning, as even Peter denies Jesus in the end.<ref>Miller 20</ref>

Philip and Andrew are both [[Ancient_Greek|Greek]] names, also Thaddaeus and Lebbaeus.  Some Jews, especially from places like Galilee where there were substantial non-Jewish populations, did have a Greek name as well as a Jewish name.<ref>Kilgallen 71</ref> -->

<!-- The second Simon is called a ''kananaios'', probably derived from the [[Aramaic_language|Aramaic]] word ''qan'ānā'', meaning a [[Zealot|Zealot]], which might mean he belonged to a political movement in rebellion against [[Roman_Empire|Rome]], but might also mean he was religiously zealous.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 604</ref>  Luke uses the Greek term ''zēlōtēs''.

Iscariot might be Judas' last name or might be a reference to where he came from, meaning "man of [[Kerioth|Kerioth]]"<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 604</ref>  It may also be derived from [[sicarii|sicarii]]. The fact that there are twelve Apostles is seen as being related to the [[Twelve_tribes_of_Israel|Twelve tribes of Israel]].<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 604</ref>

Jesus will "send them out", the Greek verb ''apostolien'' ([http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=649 Strong's G649]) meaning to send out, to do the work he has been doing but without him being present.  Many churches interpret this as his founding of the church, as he creates a special group to work in his name without him.<ref>Kilgallen 70</ref> See also the [[Great_Commission|Great Commission]]. -->

== 捆绑并洗劫撒但 ==
{{seealso|壮士的比喻|Rejection of Jesus|But to bring a sword|Desposyni|耶稣真正的家人<!-- Jesus' True Relatives -->}}

耶稣进了一个屋子，那里聚集了大批群众，马可说，耶稣和他的门徒甚至无法吃饭。耶稣的家人（''hoi par' autou''）听见，责备耶稣“癫狂”（''exestē'' ，[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=1839 Strong's G1839]）了，要拉祂出来。<ref>马可福音3章21节</ref><!-- Hearing Jesus is being followed by so many people does not seem to accord with their view of him.<ref>Kilgallen 72</ref>  Whether it was Jesus teaching and attracting large crowds or not eating that disturbs them so much is not clear.  A few early manuscripts have "the scribes and the others" instead of his family, but these are usually seen as alterations perhaps designed to tone down the impression of Jesus' own family toward him.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 604</ref> --> 

[[Image:Beelzebub.png|right]]'s ''Dictionnaire Infernal'' (Paris, 1863).]]

<!-- Scribes from [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], who Matthew says were Pharisees, come and accuse him of something worse than being crazy, using [[Beelzebub|Beelzebub]], and/or the "prince of demons" to drive out demons.  His power over the demons, they assert, comes from evil powers itself.<ref>Kilgallen 73</ref>  Beelzebub is thought to mean perhaps "lord of the flies" or "lord of dung" or "lord of the height or dwelling", but no certainty exists as to its' exact meaning.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 604</ref>  They do not dispute that he did in fact drive out the demons.  They seem to believe Jesus' power is beyond human capabilities and must be [[supernatural|supernatural]] in origen.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 604</ref>  The charge of Jesus using evil powers was probably made against him to his followers for quite some time after his death.<ref>Kilgallen 73</ref> The [[Jesus_Seminar|Jesus Seminar]] determined the version in {{bibleverse||Luke|11:15-17}} to be "red" ("authentic") and calls it "The Beelzebul controversy." {{bibleverse||Mark|3:20-21}} is determined to be "pink" ("a close approximation of what Jesus did") and is called "Jesus' relatives come to get him" as are {{bibleverse||Mark|3:31-35}}, {{bibleverse||Matt|12:46-50}}, and [[Gospel_of_Thomas|Thomas]] [http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html 99:1-3] which are called "True relatives". -->

<!-- Mark often has Jesus using 类推、和隐喻, called [[比喻|比喻]]s by Mark.--><ref>Miller 20</ref>耶稣回答说：

:“撒但怎能赶逐撒但？若是一国自相分争，那国就站立不住；若是一家自相分争，那家就站立不住；若是撒但自相攻打分争，他就站立不住，必要灭绝。”  

:“没有人能进壮者家里，洗劫他的家具，除非先捆绑那壮者，才能洗劫他的家。”

:“我实在告诉你们，人一切的罪和亵渎，无论是[[亵渎|亵渎]]什么，都能得赦免；但无论谁亵渎[[圣灵|圣灵]]，却永不得赦免，乃要担当永远的罪。”<ref>马可福音3章23-29节</ref> 

<!-- If Jesus is working against what is evil, such as the demons, then this cannot be the work of Satan, as Satan would be working against himself.  Jesus then compares himself to a thief going into a "strong man's house", Satan's house, and binding him to "spoil his house", rob him.  Satan, says Jesus, is strong and must be constrained in order to be robbed.  He is robbing Satan of the possession of the people,<ref>Kilgallen 74</ref> or the house could be seen as the world itself.<ref>Brown 131</ref>  Jesus thus implies what he has been doing is directly against Satan and that his motives are Satan's utmost ruin.  His power, he asserts, is good and so must also come from a good source, God.<ref>Kilgallen 74</ref> 

Jesus also makes the claim that ''all sins'' can be forgiven, except for an [[eternal_sin|eternal sin]], such as blasphemy against the [[Holy_Spirit|Holy Spirit]] ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:28-29}}).  Mark inserts his own explanation as to why Jesus said this, stating "He said this because they were saying, "He has an evil spirit." ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:30|31}}), thus Jesus according to Mark is saying that accusing him of using Satan for his power is in effect calling the work of God evil and failing to see the work of God in Jesus' actions.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 604</ref>  The parallels in {{bibleverse||Matthew|12:31-32}} and {{bibleverse||Luke|12:10}} and the Gospel of Thomas 44 call this the unforgivable sin. Unforgivable sins are also listed in [[Epistle_to_the_Hebrews|Hebrews]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|6:4-6|31}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Hebrews|10:26|31}} as well as [[First_Epistle_of_John|1 John]] {{bibleverse-nb||1John|5:16-17|31}}.  There is also a possible link with [[First_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb||1Corinthians|12:2-3|31}}.<ref>Brown 131</ref> -->

<!-- His first answer to the charge, that a "house divided" cannot stand, has become a common piece of [[wisdom|wisdom]], the most famous modern example is [[Abraham_Lincoln|Lincoln's]] use of this phrase during the 1858 senatorial election campaign against [[Stephen_Douglas|Stephen Douglas]].  Lincoln used the metaphor of a "house divided" to describe the situation of the [[United_States_of_America|United States]] on the eve of the [[American_Civil_War|Civil War]]. -->

<!-- His [[Mary,_the_mother_of_Jesus|Mother]] and brothers arrive and send someone in to get him.  He replies, speaking to the crowd around him, "Here are my mother and my brothers! Whoever does God's [[will|will]] is my brother and sister and mother." ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:34-35|31}})

Jesus' answer to his family, that those who follow him are his family is, according to Kilgallen, Jesus' way of underlying "...the fact that his life has been changed to such a degree that family ties no longer come before those whom he teaches about the [[kingdom_of_God|kingdom of God]]."<ref>Kilgallen 75</ref>  Jesus puts loyalty to God above loyalty to family.  Family ties were considered very important in the society of the time,<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 605</ref> and some people even today are troubled by this seeming conflict between Jesus and his family.<ref>Brown 131</ref>  Jesus however states that his ties, and his respect and love due to his family, will go to those who obey God.<ref>Kilgallen 75</ref>  Jesus' family is mentioned again in Mark {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|6:3|31}}.  The story of Jesus and his family is also found in the Gospel of Thomas as saying 99.  In Mark {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|10:28-31|31}} Peter says they have left everything to follow Jesus and he lists the great rewards as well as persecutions they will get for following him. -->

<!-- These incidents occur in all the [[Synoptic_Gospels|Synoptic Gospels]]. In Matthew they occur in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=12&version=31 12:22-50], and in Luke they are split up between [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&chapter=8&version=31 8:19-21] and [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&chapter=11&version=31 11:14-28].  Neither Matthew nor Luke though state that Jesus's family thought he was "... out of his mind."  John, while mentioning none of these incidents, relates in chapter [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&chapter=7&version=31 7] how "...even his own brothers did not believe in him." because he would not go to the [[Feast_of_Tabernacles|Feast of Tabernacles]] with them and perform miracles, although he later goes there in secret. {{bibleverse||John|6:66}} says "many of his disciples turned back and no longer followed him." The negative view of [[Desposyni|Jesus' family]] may be related to the conflict between Paul and [[Jewish_Christians|Jewish Christians]].<ref>http://www.jesuspolice.com/common_error.php?id=11 "Wilson (1992) [Wilson, A.N. Jesus: A life. 1992. New York: Norton & Co.] has [[Hypothesis|hypothesized]] that the negative relationship between Jesus and his family was placed in the Gospels (especially in the Gospel of Mark) to dissuade early Christians from following the Jesus cult that was administered by Jesus’ family. Wilson says: “…it would not be surprising if other parts of the church, particularly the Gentiles, liked telling stories about Jesus as a man who had no sympathy or support from his family (p. 86).” Butz (2005) [Butz, Jeffrey. The brother of Jesus and the lost teachings of Christianity. 2005. Rochester, Vermont: Inner Traditions.] is more succinct: “…by the time Mark was writing in the late 60s, the Gentile churches outside of Israel were beginning to resent the authority wielded by Jerusalem where James and the apostles were leaders, thus providing the motive for Mark’s antifamily stance… (p. 44).” Other prominent scholars agree (e.g., Crosson, 1973 [Crosson, John Dominic. “Mark and the relatives of Jesus”. Novum Testamentum, 15, 1973]; Mack, 1988 [Mack, Burton. A myth of innocence: Mark and Christian origins. 1988. Philadelphia: Fortress]; Painter. 1999 [Painter, John. Just James: The brother of Jesus in history and tradition. 1999. Minneapolis: Fortress Press])."</ref> -->

<!-- There is much disagreement over whether these "brothers" referred to here are Jesus' actual brothers or merely step-brothers or cousins.  The official [[Roman_Catholic|Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern_Orthodox|Eastern Orthodox]] doctrine is that [[Perpetual_virginity_of_Mary|Mary was a perpetual virgin]], and so could not have had any other children besides Jesus, thus making these Jesus's half brothers, sons of Joseph by another, unrecorded marriage, or cousins.  Only [[Tertullian|Tertullian]] seems to have questioned this in the early Church.  [[Islam|Islam]] also holds that Mary was a perpetual virgin as did many of the early [[Protestants|Protestants]], although many Protestants today do not hold to the doctrine of perpetual virginity, and would thus believe that these are Jesus' full brothers.  A few early manuscripts also have "and your sisters" in verse {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:32|31}}.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 605</ref>

This section gives a clear example of Mark's sandwich technique, where one story is interspersed into the center of another.  Mark has highlighted two reactions to Jesus and his teaching and acts:  One of faith, such as that of his followers, compared to disbelief and hostility.<ref>Kilgallen 72</ref>  Jesus explains the nature of the effect of his teachings on others in the [[Parable_of_the_Sower|Parable of the Sower]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|4|31}}. -->
