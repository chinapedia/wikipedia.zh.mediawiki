'''马可福音2章'''是《[[新约圣经|新约圣经]]·[[马可福音|马可福音]]》的第二章。在本章首次发生犹太宗教领袖和耶稣之间的争论：耶稣治愈了一个[[瘫痪|瘫痪]]的人，并且赦免了他的罪；然后与利未等声名狼藉的“好些税吏和罪人”同桌吃饭；争论是否需要[[禁食|禁食]]（Fasting）；是否应该在[[安息日|安息日]]掐起麦穗。

== 赦免瘫子的罪 ==
[[马可|马可]]说耶稣回到[[迦百农|迦百农]]，<!-- 这可能是[[彼得|彼得]]'s house again<ref>Kilgallen 49</ref> or another house in Capernaum, Jesus' home at this time.  Jesus is teaching in the house and a large crowd has gathered to hear him.  Mark says he "preached the [[word|word]] to them" ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:2|31}}) using [[logos|logos]] for word. -->

四个人要抬一个瘫子到耶稣面前，因为拥挤，不能带到祂跟前，于是他们将屋顶拆了一个洞，把瘫子所躺卧的褥子缒下去。这显示这所房子很简陋，屋顶材料可能是树叶、树皮和泥土。<ref>Kilgallen 49</ref> 但可能有一根木梁来支撑。<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 601</ref> 这是当时巴勒斯坦一所平常的房屋。<ref>Miller 16</ref>

耶稣被他们的信心感动，就告诉瘫子说他的罪得到了赦免，并亲切地称呼瘫子为“孩子”。<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref>

一些经学家就谴责这件事：“这个人为什么这样说？祂说僭妄的话了。除了神一位以外，谁能赦罪？”<ref>马可福音2章7节</ref>马可说耶稣[[灵|灵]]里即刻知道他们心里这样议论，就对他们说，你们心里为什么议论这些事？看来他像全能者能知道人的思想<ref>马可福音2章8节</ref>；又说，“你的罪赦了，或说，起来，拿你的褥子行走，哪一样更容易？但要叫你们知道[[人子|人子]]在地上有赦罪的权柄”。于是他就吩咐瘫子，“我吩咐你，起来，拿你的褥子回家去吧！”<ref>马可福音2章9-11节</ref> <!-- 那人就起来，立刻2拿着褥子，当着众人面前3出去了，以致众人都惊奇，荣耀神说，我们从来没有见过这样的事。 --> 

<!-- It is easier to tell the man something than to demand he get up and walk.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref>  Jesus however proves his ability with a demonstration of the man's ability to walk.  He heals by word alone, highlighting the power of Jesus' word's about forgiveness.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref>  Mark says that "everyone" was amazed by this, presumably including the teachers.

Jesus here refers to himself as the Son of Man, ''ho huios tou anthrōpou'' (literally ''son of the [[human|human]] being''), which he does many times in Mark.  This is taken in several ways in Mark, but here probably refers to Jesus as God's representative on Earth.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref>  The term comes from many sources such as the [[但以理书|但以理书]], 但以理 但以理书|7|31}} for instance.  It is also found in the [[Book_of_Enoch|Book of Enoch]].  In the [[Jewish_eschatology|Jewish apocalyptic tradition]] this title represents the judge during the [[Last_judgement|final judgement]].  He was often viewed as [[angel|angel]]ic or as a [[heaven|heaven]]ly being who comes as a flesh and blood person.   Only Jesus mentions this title in the Gospels often using it to speak about himself in the [[Grammatical_person|third person]].  It has also been seen as symbolic of God's plan for all people.<ref>Miller 17</ref> -->

<!-- By healing the man and then forgiving his sins, some have seen Jesus linking sins and illness, although Mark says Jesus healed him after he saw "their faith".  Both in Luke {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|13:1-5|31}} and John {{bibleverse-nb||John|9:2-3|31}} Jesus rejects the notion that illness and misfortune are the result of sins.  Other parts of the Bible, such as [[Book_of_Job|Book of Job]], take a similar view of life's misfortunes as not being divine punishment.  Other stories such as the story of [[Sodom_and_Gomorrah|Sodom and Gomorrah]] in [[Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||Genesis|18:16-19:29|31}} seem to stress that sins can result in worldly punishment.

The teachers say only God can forgive one's sins, some see  [[Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|34:6-7|31}} and [[Book_of_Isaiah|Isaiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|43:25|31}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|44:22|31}} as proof of this claim.  Mark thus leaves it implied that Jesus is God and that faith in his power will lead to not just a cure of physical ills but to a forgiveness of a person's sins.<ref>Kilgallen 53</ref>  [[Early_Christians|Early Christians]] may have used this story to buttress their claims of Jesus' ability to forgive sins.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 601</ref>  Thus to the teachers Jesus claim is blasphemy as they do not think Jesus is God, but to Mark's audience this confirms their belief in Jesus' [[divinity|divinity]].<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref> -->

<!-- This is the first conflict between Jesus and other Jewish teachers in Mark.  Mark might be starting his explanation of why these Jewish authorities later turned on Jesus.<ref>Miller 17</ref>

This takes place in all the [[Synoptic_Gospels|Synoptic Gospels]], ([[Gospel_of_Luke|Luke]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&chapter=5&version=31 5:17-26] and [[Gospel_of_Matthew|Matthew]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=9&version=31 9:1-8]) and a very similar yet slightly different story occurs in [[John_5|John]] [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=50&chapter=5&version=31 5:1-14].  John's healing takes place in [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]], yet the story in the synoptics takes place in [[Capernaum|Capernaum]].  All the synoptics agree that the man was paralyzed and then the ''teachers of the law'' got mad at Jesus because he said he forgave the man's [[sins|sins]].  The story  in John has the ''people'' getting mad at him because he did this on the Sabbath.

The [[Discourse_on_ostentation|Discourse on ostentation]] after the [[Lord's_Prayer|Lord's Prayer]] states: "For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins." ({{bibleverse||Matt|6:9-15}})

[[Image:Calling-of-st-matthew.jpg|thumb]]]]

<!-- Jesus, while teaching a large crowd by the lake, finds Levi at the tax collector's booth and says "Follow me!"  {{bibleverse||Luke|5:27-29}} also calls him Levi. Matthew's version of this story clearly lists him as [[Saint_Matthew|Matthew]], the tax collector and apostle, in {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|9:9|31}},{{bibleverse-nb||Matt|10:3}}.  Mark lists him as the son of Alphaeus, although Alphaeus is also listed as the name of the father of [[Saint_James_the_Great|James]].  A few manuscripts say James and not Levi, but most think this is an attempt by a copyist at correction.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref>  Some just assume he had two names, ''Matthew-Levi'',<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10056b.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Matthew]</ref> maybe a middle or nickname, and both father's had the same name.  Mark does not list a Levi as one of the [[Twelve_Apostles|Twelve Apostles]] in {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|3:16-19|31}}, so if one only considers Mark it is not clear this Levi was an Apostle.  

A tax collector could mean two things.  He could have been an independent contractor with the [[Roman_Empire|Roman government]], who paid taxes to Rome and then got the right to extract taxes from the people in a certain area, with an added fee for the collector and people he would hire.  He might have also been a toll collector for [[Herod_Antipas|Herod Antipas]],<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref> extracting the tolls people had to pay to enter parts of Palestine, and Capernaum was an area with a high traffic of movement of people and merchants.<ref>Kilgallen 55</ref>  Either way, Levi would have been a very unpopular and even despised person. -->   

<!-- Jesus and his disciples eat with Levi and his disreputable friends and the "teachers of the law who were [[Pharisees|Pharisees]]" ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:16|31}}) ask his disciples why.  Teaching the law was a profession, and the Pharisees were a group of men who were considered [[pious|pious]], so Mark states these people are both Pharisees who also taught the law.  Whether they were at the dinner or passing by and saw this meal is unclear.  The proper preparing and eating of food are very important in [[Judaism|Judaism]].  It was even considered dangerous to eat with those who did not observe the same dining customs by some Jews like the Pharisees.<ref>Miller 17</ref> See also the "Incident at Antioch"<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/08537a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: Judaizers] see section titled: "THE INCIDENT AT ANTIOCH"</ref> {{bibleverse||Gal|2:11-21}}.

Most think, and most translations say, that this was at Levi's house, although the original texts state this was at "his" house, which could be Levi's or perhaps Jesus' house, maybe the one he was teaching in already mentioned.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref> Mark says many people are now following Jesus, more than the four disciples he has already listed. See also [[Mark_6#Healing_of_the_sick_of_Gennesaret|Mark 6#Healing of the sick of Gennesaret]]. In contrast to the many followers Jesus attracted, it is not clear how many actual disciples (students) he recruited, only {{bibleverse||Luke|6:17|NRSV}} calls it a "great crowd of ... disciples" and {{bibleverse||John|6:66}} says many left. -->

<!-- [[诗篇|诗篇]] {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|119|31}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Psalm|101|31}} speak of God's disfavor of sinners.  Jesus replies the famous "It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the [[righteous|righteous]], but sinners."  Matthew has him say "But go and learn what this means: 'I desire [[mercy|mercy]], not [[sacrifice|sacrifice]]." between the two sentences in Mark's version.  Luke says "...but sinners to [[repentance|repentance]]."  Jesus compares himself to a doctor to show that, as a doctor fights disease by working with the sick, so Jesus must go to sinners in order to help them overcome their sins.  Jesus said he was seeking repentance in {{bibleverse-nb||Mark|1:14-15|31}}.

The [[Oxyrhynchus_Gospels#Oxyrhynchus_1224|Oxyrhynchus Gospels 1224]] 5:1-2 also record this episode of "dining with sinners". -->

<!-- Jesus thus ends the debate with a pithy statement with no rebuttal by his opponents.  Many see this as Mark's way of telling the story to set up Jesus for his memorable words, which Mark uses in the next two incidents and others as well.  Scholars have labeled this method of narration an [[Adage|apophthegm]], chreia or pronouncement story.<ref>Miller 18</ref>  All three synoptics have this occur after the healing of the paralyzed man. -->

== 禁食与新皮袋 ==
{{seealso|禁食|新酒与旧皮袋)}}

<!-- It appears Mark then jumps to a future time, though it is possible he is still referring to Jesus' dinner with the sinners.  Some (unnamed) people ask why is it that the disciples of [[John_the_Baptist|John the Baptist]] and the Pharisees are fasting (observing a fast, i.e. not eating), but the disciples of Jesus are not ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:18}}).  People fasted for many reasons, such as mourning or [[penitence|penitence]],<ref>Miller 18</ref> but another reason was to prepare for the anticipated coming of the [[messiah|messiah]] and perhaps even to speed up the process.<ref>Kilgallen 58</ref> {{bibleverse||Leviticus|16:29}} demands fasting on the [[Yom_Kippur|Day of Atonement]], "a permanent statute", "whether the native, or the alien" ([[NASB|NASB]]).  Luke {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|18:11-12|31}} has an unnamed Pharisee brag about his fasting.  For what reason John's disciples were fasting Mark does not say.  In {{bibleverse||Matthew|6:16-18}}, Jesus gives instructions about fasting, but see also [[Sermon_on_the_Mount#Interpretation|Sermon on the Mount#Interpretation]].  Jesus also talks about fasting in the [[Gospel_of_Thomas|Gospel of Thomas]] in sayings [http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gosthom.html 14, 27, 104], sometimes against it such as saying 14 but saying 104 closely resembles this story about fasting and [[wedding|wedding]]s.

Jesus justifies this behavior and speaks of himself as the [[bridegroom|bridegroom]] and his disciples as his guests  at his wedding and by giving the [[parable|parable]] of the Patch and the Wineskins.   Jesus speaking of himself as the bridegroom carries messianic overtones.  Jesus is referred to as a bridegroom in several places in the New Testament such as John {{bibleverse-nb||John|3:29|31}}, [[Second_Epistle_to_the_Corinthians|2 Corinthians]] {{bibleverse-nb||2Corinthians|11:2|31}}, the [[Epistle_to_the_Ephesians|Epistle to the Ephesians]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ephesians|5:32|31}} and [[Book_of_Revelation|Revelation]] {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|19:7|31}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Revelation|21:2|31}}.  In Thomas saying 75 Jesus talks about being alone and entering the bridal suite.  Several books of the [[Tanakh|Jewish Bible]] speak of God as Israel's husband such as the [[Book_of_Hosea|Book of Hosea]] {{bibleverse-nb||Hosea|2:19|31}}, the [[Book_of_Isaiah|Book of Isaiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|54:4-8|31}} and {{bibleverse-nb||Isaiah|62:4-5|31}}, the [[Book_of_Jeremiah|Book of Jeremiah]] {{bibleverse-nb||Jeremiah|2:2|31}} and the [[Book_of_Ezekiel|Book of Ezekiel]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ezekiel|16:7-63|31}}. -->

<!-- Jesus then says the bridegroom will be "taken from them" and then his disciples will fast, on that day, see also [[Lent|Lent]].  This is taken as an allusion to Jesus' death.  For those who do not believe Jesus really had foreknowledge of his death this is taken as a product of the early Church.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref>  There is no purpose in fasting as the messiah, Jesus, is already here and his coming is like a wedding celebration, at which people do not fast.<ref>Kilgallen 58</ref> -->

耶稣又说到酒和皮袋：

:“没有人用未漂过的布作补丁，缝在旧衣服上；不然，所补上的新布，会扯破旧的，裂缝就更大了。也没有人把新酒装在旧皮袋里；不然，酒把皮袋胀裂，酒和皮袋就都坏了；惟把新酒装在新皮袋里。” <ref>马可福音2章21-22节</ref> 

<!-- This is a very famous saying of Jesus.  What its exact meaning is in the original context is not totally clear to even scholars today.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 602</ref>  It is easily interpreted to mean Jesus was proposing a new way of doing things.  The new "unshrunk" patch for the cloth can not be melded to the old cloth as it will shrink and make the tear of the cloth worse.  One can also not use "new" wine with "old" wineskins as the new wine will ferment and expand and break the old skins.  Jesus thus seems to be concerned that the patch and the "new" wine ''as well'' as the "old" cloth and old wineskins be preserved.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref>  This might be Jesus trying to convey that one must shed those old things that are incompatible with his new way.<ref>Kilgallen 59</ref>  Some of the old things however are worth preserving, but one must not mix the two. -->

<!-- Many, especially Christians, have interpreted it as Jesus saying he was the start of a new [[religion|religion]] separate from [[John_the_Baptist|John the Baptist]] and [[Judaism|Judaism]], called [[Christianity|Christianity]], for example see [[Ignatius_of_Antioch|Ignatius of Antioch]] [http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/text/ignatius-magnesians-roberts.html Magnesians X].  Some Christians have used it to propose new ways of being Christian or even entirely new forms of Christianity.  As early as the [[second_century|second century]], [[Marcion|Marcion]] used it to justify his doctrine, later called heretical [[Marcionism|Marcionism]]. Against these interpretations, {{bibleverse||Luke|5:39|NASB}} adds: "And no one, after drinking old wine wishes for new; for he says, 'The old is good enough.'"  This saying is also found partially as saying 47 of the Gospel of Thomas.  This is the midpoint of Jesus' early conflicts with other Jewish teachers in Mark. -->

== 在安息日掐麦穗 ==
[[Image:Ten_Commandments_Monument.jpg|thumb]]碑]]
{{seealso|安息日|十诫}}

<!-- The doctrine of a new way (assuming it is a new way) is laid out further.  Next, Jesus' disciples pick some grain on the Sabbath, and the Pharisees accuse them of breaking the Sabbath ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:23-24}}).  The command to observe the Sabbath is found in [[Exodus|Exodus]] {{bibleverse-nb||Exodus|31:16-17}}, a "perpetual [[Covenant_(biblical)|covenant]] ... [for] the [[Children_of_Israel|people of Israel]]" ([[NRSV|NRSV]]).  [[Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] {{bibleverse-nb||Deuteronomy|23:25}} says one may pick grain from someone else's field.  It would appear that the Pharisees were following Jesus or simply ran into him somehow in or near the grainfields.  Some think this is not historical but is Mark's literary way of debating Sabbath observance issues.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref> [[E._P._Sanders|E. P. Sanders]] argues that these debates on the Sabbath, handwashing, and food are artificial constructs of Mark as there were debates between [[Paul_of_Tarsus|Paul]] and other Christians ({{bibleverse||Gal|2:11-14}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Gal|4:10}}; {{bibleverse||Rom|14:1-6}}) about the issue after Jesus' ministry.<ref>"Just ''how'' incredible many of them are, however, seems not to be realized by many." ''-Jesus and Judaism'', 1985, ISBN 0-8006-0743-0, pp.264-269, ''Sabbath, handwashing, and food''</ref> The [[Jesus_Seminar|Jesus Seminar]] determined {{bibleverse||Mark|2:23-28}}, {{bibleverse||Matt|12:1-8}}, {{bibleverse||Luke|6:1-5}} to be "pink" acts of Jesus, that is "a close approximation of what Jesus did" and call them "Sabbath observance."

Jesus points out to them a story about [[David|David]] found in [[Book_of_Samuel|1 Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb||1Samuel|21|31}}.  David had been allowed to eat special consecrated bread reserved for the priests, detailed in Leviticus {{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|24:5-9|31}}.  Thus if David was allowed to break a commandment for hunger, so Jesus can do the same.  In Mark Jesus says this was when [[Abiathar|Abiathar]] was high priest, while Samuel says the high priest was [[Ahimelech|Ahimelech]], Abiathar's father.  Luke {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|6:4|31}} and Matthew {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|12:4|31}} both do not name the high priest.  Mark may have simply made a reading error or had an incomplete or inaccurate copy of the [[Books_of_Samuel|Books of Samuel]].  A few early Marcan manuscripts omit this phrase, but most scholars think the name of the priest was originally written by Mark, not a later copyist.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref> -->

<!-- Jesus then says "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.  So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath." ({{bibleverse-nb||Mark|2:27-28|31}})  Thus human needs take precedence over strict observance of the [[Halakha|law]].  Some see this as a radical departure from the Jewish understanding of the law (see also [[Judaism_and_Christianity|Judaism and Christianity]]).  Both Luke {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|6:1-5|31}} and Matthew {{bibleverse-nb||Matthew|12:1-8|31}} do not have the first phrase putting people ahead of the Sabbath.  Since most scholars believe the [[Q_document|Q]] [[hypothesis|hypothesis]] and that Luke and Matthew copied from Mark, many argue they might have found this too radical and so chose not to include it.  Jesus here claims he knows what the Sabbath is for, and thus that he knows the mind of God, something only God could do, and equates himself with the "Lord of the Sabbath", God.<ref>Kilgallen 61</ref>  The passage thus has a [[Christology|christological]] climax.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref>

Most [[scholars|scholars]] agree that the Sabbath and proper observance of [[Mosaic_law|Mosaic law]] in general were a point of contention between Jesus and other Jewish teachers.  A minority position, held by scholars such as E. P. Sanders, is that these do not constitute proof of a [[Antinomianism|rejection of the law]], e.g., Sanders claims there was no significant conflict between the Pharisees as a group and Jesus and that the Church took some time to reach its position on the Sabbath, which makes it difficult to believe Jesus specifically taught one position or the other.<ref> Sanders ''Jesus and Judaism'', 1985, pages 264-269 on the Sabbath, handwashing and food </ref>  The [[Jewish_Encyclopedia|Jewish Encyclopedia]] article on [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=254&letter=J&search=Jesus Jesus] argues the [[Halakah|Halakah]] ("Jewish Law") was not in so definite a form at this period due to the disputes of [[Hillel_the_Elder|Bet Hillel]] and [[Shammai|Bet Shammai]].

There were debates within [[Early_Christianity|Early Christianity]], such as at the [[Council_of_Jerusalem|Council of Jerusalem]] between Paul and [[Jewish_Christians|Jewish Christians]], over just how much of the [[Law_of_Moses|Law of Moses]] one should follow. See also [[Old_Testament#Christian_view_of_the_Law|Old Testament#Christian view of the Law]] for the modern debates. This passage might have been used by the early Church in defense of their less than strict observance of the Sabbath against Jews like the Pharisees who held a harder line on Sabbath observance.<ref>Brown ''et al.'' 603</ref> The Jewish Encyclopedia article on Jesus notes: "...stricter rabbis allowed only the saving of life to excuse the slightest curtailment of the Sabbath rest (Shab. xxii. 6)." See also [[Council_of_Jamnia|Council of Jamnia]]. -->

<!-- These stories are almost entirely the same in Luke [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&chapter=5&version=31 5-6], and in Matthew except for the story of the Sabbath, which occurs in Matthew at Chapter [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=47&chapter=12&version=31 12].  They do not occur in John except for perhaps the paralyzed man.

According to the [http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=245&letter=N&search=Gospel#703 Jewish Encyclopedia: New Testament: Misunderstood Passages]:
:"Misunderstanding of the term "be-ḥad le-shabba tinyana" (on the first of the second week after Passover), preserved only in Luke vi. 1, caused the confusion of the law concerning the new produce of the year (Lev. xxiii. 11-14) with the Sabbath law (see Jew. Encyc. vii. 168, s.v. Jesus). In the one case Jesus, referring to David, defended his disciples, who in their hunger plucked the new corn in the field and ate it without waiting for the offering upon the altar; in the other case he himself disregarded the Sabbath law in view of the "pikkuaḥ nefesh" (peril of life), a case in which the Rabbis admitted the suspension of the law, upon the principle, "The Sabbath is given over to you ["the son of man"], and not you to the Sabbath" (see Mek., Wayaḳhel, 1; Chwolson, "Das Letzte Passahmahl," 1892, pp. 59-67, 91-92)."
