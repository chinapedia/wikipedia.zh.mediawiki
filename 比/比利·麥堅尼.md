One of the products of the [[Dundee_United_F.C.|Dundee United]]'s highly efficient scouting and coaching network in the west of Scotland, [[Glasgow|Glasgow]]-born McKinlay was signed from Hamilton Thistle in 1986. He won a place in the [[1988_Scottish_Cup_Final|1988 Scottish Cup Final]] side at the age of 19, despite previously having made just 12 [[Scottish_Football_League|league]] appearances.

An energetic and perceptive [[midfielder|midfielder]], he took some time to claim a regular first-team place, but when he did was a most effective link man. He suffered a major disappointment in May 1994 when a caution for an innocuous tackle in a League match carried him over the points threshold and led to him being suspended when United achieved their historic first Scottish Cup triumph. He went on to win 14 full international caps while at [[Tannadice_Park|Tannadice]], the latter two as a [[Scottish_Football_League_First_Division|First Division]] player. He is one of only three players from that division to play at full international level for Scotland since 1975.

Following United's relegation he asked for a transfer and got his wish when [[Blackburn_Rovers|Blackburn Rovers]] paid [[Pound_sterling|£]]1.75 million for him in October 1995. He came close to joining boyhood heroes [[Celtic_F.C.|Celtic F.C.]] when then manager Tommy Burns made a last-ditch attempt to sign him from under the noses of Blackburn Rovers. McKinlay had brief spells with [[Bradford_City_A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and [[Clydebank_F.C.|Clydebank]] before joining Premiership side [[Leicester_City_F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2002, where he scored once against Coventry City.<ref>{{cite web

On 21 December 2007, Fulham first-team coach [[Ray_Lewington|Ray Lewington]] and reserve team manager McKinlay took over after manager [[Lawrie_Sanchez|Lawrie Sanchez]] was sacked.

On 2 December 2013, McKinlay left Fulham after Martin Jol's departure a day earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fulhamfc.com/news/2013/december/02/coaching-staff-update|title=Coaching Staff Update|publisher=Fulham FC|date=2 December 2013|accessdate=19 December 2013}}</ref>
