==生平==
<!--
===球員===
Born in [[Campania|Campania]], Sannino relocated to [[Turin|Turin]] with his family after his father was hired by the [[Fiat|Fiat]] automobile company in [[Turin|Turin]]. In his career, Sannino played as a creative attacking midfielder for several minor league teams, with [[Serie_C2|Serie C2]] club [[A.C._Voghera|Vogherese]] being the one he became most associated with. Sannino retired from active football in 1988, after a lone season with [[Liguria|Liguria]]n amateur club [[Virtus_Entella|Entella]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://ricerca.gelocal.it/laprovinciapavese/archivio/laprovinciapavese/2010/06/21/PB1PO_PB104.html |publisher=La Provincia Pavese |language=it |accessdate=28 June 2011 |date=21 June 2010 |title=Da mezzapunta fantasiosa a "mago" della panchina}}</ref>

<!--
Sannino entered into a coaching career in 1990, as responsible of the ''Allievi'' (under-17) team at [[A.C._Voghera|Vogherese]]. In 1992 he became youth coach at [[A.C._Pavia|Pavia]], and one year later he worked with the same role at [[A.C._Monza_Brianza_1912|Monza]]. In 1996 he took his first head coaching experience at amateur [[Eccellenza|Eccellenza]] club [[A.S.D._S.B.C._Oltrepò|Oltrepò]], ending the season in sixth place.<ref name="reggio">{{cite news |url=http://www.reggionelpallone.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12894:tecnici-contro-beppe-sannino-la-scheda&catid=24:slide |publisher=ReggioNelPallone.it |language=it |accessdate=28 June 2011 |date=7 May 2011 |title=Tecnici contro: Beppe Sannino, la scheda }}</ref> After a short stint as youth coach at [[Calcio_Como|Como]], in 1998 Sannino took his first head coaching role in a professional league at [[Serie_C2|Serie C2]] club [[A.S.D._Junior_Biellese_Libertas|Biellese]]: this experience however turned out to be disappointing, as he was dismissed before the end of the season.<ref name="reggio" />

In 1999 he took a personal revenge as he led [[Serie_D|Serie D]] club [[F.C._Südtirol|F.C. Südtirol]] to first place in the league, and then keeping the club into Serie C2 the following season. In 2001–02 he guided [[A.C._Meda_1913|Meda]], another Serie C2 club, but was dismissed again before the end of the season. In 2002–03 he then led [[A.C._Sangiovannese_1927|Sangiovannese]] to sixth place in the Serie C2 league. Two other unsuccessful stints, both ended with him being removed from managerial duties, followed at [[A.S._Varese_1910|Varese]] and [[Cosenza_Calcio_1914|Cosenza]]. In 2005 he took the reins of [[Calcio_Lecco_1912|Lecco]], guiding the small Lombardian team to a surprise promotion to [[Serie_C1|Serie C1]] at his second season in charge of the club.<ref name="reggio" /> This was followed by three more consecutive promotions: the first at [[U.S._Pergocrema_1932|Pergocrema]] (from Serie C2 to Serie C1), and the other two at Varese, where he was appointed by [[Sean_Sogliano|Sean Sogliano]] during the season and successfully guided the club from Serie C2 to Serie B. In his first season in charge of a Serie B club, Sannino led Varese to a remarkable fourth place and a spot in the [[Serie_A|Serie A]] promotion playoffs, then lost to [[Calcio_Padova|Padova]] in the semi-finals.<ref name="reggio" />

On June 2011 Sannino signed a two-year contract as head coach of newly promoted Serie A club [[A.C._Siena|Siena]], taking over from departing boss [[Antonio_Conte|Antonio Conte]] who was signed by Italian giants [[Juventus_F.C.|Juventus]]. The aim for the small Tuscan club will be to escape relegation in what is going to be Sannino's first experience in charge of a top flight club.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.repubblica.it/sport/calcio/serie-a/2011/06/06/news/siena_sannino_nuovo_tenico-17301604/ |publisher=La Repubblica |language=it |accessdate=28 June 2011 |date=6 June 2010 |title=Mezzaroma ha deciso Sannino è il nuovo tecnico}}</ref> In the 2011–12 season, Sannino managed to keep Siena safely out of the relegation zone, and also led the club to the [[2011–12_Coppa_Italia|Coppa Italia]] semifinals, then lost to eventual winners [[S.S.C._Napoli|Napoli]].

On 6 June 2012 Sannino signed a two-year contract as head coach of [[U.S._Città_di_Palermo|Palermo]], only a few weeks after Siena director of football [[Giorgio_Perinetti|Giorgio Perinetti]] made the same move to Sicily.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://palermocalcio.it/it/1112/news/scheda.php?id=26844 |publisher=US Città di Palermo |language=it |accessdate=6 June 2012 |date=6 June 2012 |title=BENVENUTO MISTER SANNINO |trans_title=WELCOME COACH SANNINO}}</ref> His short-lived experience with the Sicilians ended on 16 September 2012, when club chairman [[Maurizio_Zamparini|Maurizio Zamparini]] decided to remove him from first team duties after achieving only one point in the first three Serie A games; he was replaced by [[Gian_Piero_Gasperini|Gian Piero Gasperini]].<ref>{{cite news |publisher=US Città di Palermo |language=it |accessdate=16 September 2012 |date=16 September 2012 |url=http://palermocalcio.it/it/1213/news/scheda.php?id=27282 |title=ESONERATO SANNINO, SQUADRA A GASPERINI |trans_title=SANNINO SACKED, TEAM GOES TO GASPERINI }}</ref> He was rehired on 11 March 2013.<ref>http://www.football-italia.net/31775/palermo-announce-sannino-return</ref> Despite an impressive string of results with a particularly difficult calendar (including wins against Inter and Roma), however, he failed to keep Palermo in the top flight.
He was appointed as Chievo coach on  the 1st of July. However he was sacked on the 11th of November.
