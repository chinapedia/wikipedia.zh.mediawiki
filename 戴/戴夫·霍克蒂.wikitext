==生平==
===球員時莉期===
;黑池
Hockaday was born in [[Sedgefield|Sedgefield]], County Durham, he started his career as a youth player with [[Billingham_Synthonia_F.C.|Billingham Synthonia]]. In June 1975, aged 17, he joined [[Blackpool_F.C.|Blackpool]], then playing in the [[Football_League_Second_Division|Second Division]]. He made his first start for the Tangerines on 25 September 1976, in a 1–0 home loss to [[Chelsea_F.C.|Chelsea]]. Aside from a [[Football_League_Cup|League Cup]] second-round tie against [[Sheffield_Wednesday_F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]], he sat out the entire [[1977–78_in_English_football|1977–78]] campaign, but [[1978–79_in_English_football|the following season]] he became a more regular first-team player as Blackpool slid down the leagues. He scored his first goal for the club in a 3–1 loss at [[Colchester_United_F.C.|Colchester United]] on 30 September 1978, and, later that season, scored both goals in Blackpool's 2–1 victory at [[Lincoln_City_F.C.|Lincoln City]].

Also on 30 September, this time in 1981, Hockaday was amongst the scorers in Blackpool's 7–1 rout of [[Halifax_Town_A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] at [[Bloomfield_Road|Bloomfield Road]]. In his [[1982–83_in_English_football#Fourth_Division|final season]] in Lancashire, he made 40 league appearances and scored eight goals, but was unable to prevent Blackpool from finishing fourth from bottom and needing to seek re-election. In his eight seasons at Blackpool he made over 190 first-team appearances, scoring 27 goals.<ref>{{cite book | first=Roy | last=Calley| coauthors= | title=Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887–1992 | publisher=Breedon Books Sport | location= | year=1992 | editor= | isbn = 1-873626-07-X}}</ref>

;史雲頓
In June 1983, he moved on a free transfer to fellow [[Football_League_Fourth_Division|Fourth Division]] side [[Swindon_Town_F.C.|Swindon Town]]. He was a solid, dependable right-back and was part of the team managed by [[Lou_Macari|Lou Macari]] that gained the Fourth Division championship in the [[1985–86_in_English_football#Fourth_Division|1985–86 season]], following this with promotion to Division Two in [[1986–87_in_English_football#Second_Division|1986–87]]. In [[1988–89_in_English_football#Division_Two_playoff|1988–89]] Swindon reached the [[Football_League_Second_Division|Second Division]] [[Football_League_play-offs|play-offs]] but failed in their attempt to gain promotion to the top flight. In [[1989–90_in_English_football#Second_Division|1989–90]] Swindon won the Second Division play-off final but [[Sunderland_A.F.C.|Sunderland]] were promoted instead after the Swindon board admitted a series of financial irregularities. Swindon were initially demoted to the Third Division and replaced by [[Tranmere_Rovers_F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]], the division's losing play-off finalists, but this decision was later reversed on appeal. In September 1990, Hockaday moved to [[Hull_City_A.F.C.|Hull City]] for a fee of £50,000 having made 308 appearances for Swindon, with 11 goals.

;球員晚期
At Hull City he was part of the side which suffered relegation from the Second Division at the end of the [[1990–91_in_English_football|1990–91]] season. He played 15 times for Hull the following season and spent the end the that [[1992–93_Stoke_City_F.C._season|1992–93]] campaign on loan at [[Stoke_City_F.C.|Stoke City]] where he played seven times helping the Potters win the [[Football_League_Second_Division|Second Division]] title.<ref name="Stoke City Modern Era"/> After a third season at Hull he moved on to [[Shrewsbury_Town_F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]]. He was a member of the Shrewsbury team who won the [[1993–94_in_English_football#Endsleigh_League_Division_Three|Third Division]] title at the end of his first season, before he dropped out of league football, moving to [[Cirencester_Town_F.C.|Cirencester Town]] in 1995.

===教練及領隊時期===
;青訓學院及球會教練
In 1995 he established the first football academy in the country at [[Cirencester|Cirencester]]. The Cirencester Football Academy was created in conjunction with the local Sixth Form College. The Academy team soon built up a nation-wide reputation by winning the National College Championship. Subsequently, his concept of a football academy has been adopted by most major clubs in England. In 2000 he joined [[Graham_Taylor_(football_manager)|Graham Taylor]] at [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] as the club's Under 18 coach. As Under 18 coach at Watford, Hockaday helped develop the careers of players such as [[Paul_Robinson_(defender_born_1978)|Paul Robinson]], [[Hameur_Bouazza|Hameur Bouazza]], [[Tommy_Smith_(footballer_born_1980)|Tommy Smith]], [[Darren_Ward_(defender)|Darren Ward]], [[Ashley_Young|Ashley Young]] and [[Alhassan_Bangura|Alhassan Bangura]]. In 2005 he was promoted to first-team coach and assisted the Hornets as the club won promotion to the [[Premier_League|Premier League]] in [[2005–06_in_English_football#Football_League_Championship|2006]].

In January 2007, as Watford struggled to avoid relegation, he was sacked by manager [[Adrian_Boothroyd|Adrian Boothroyd]] and replaced by [[Malky_Mackay|Malky Mackay]] as part of a backroom shake-up at the club, there were also rumours of complaints by a number of senior players about the team's style of play.<ref>{{cite news | date=11 January 2007| title= Hockaday feels Hornets' sting| work=www.dailymail.co.uk | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=428256&in_page_id=1779&in_page_id=1779&expand=true| accessdate=23 June 2007}}</ref> In March 2007 he joined [[Martin_Allen_(footballer)|Martin Allen]] at [[Milton_Keynes_Dons_F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] until the end of the season,<ref>{{cite web| date=22 March 2007| title=Hockaday capture delight's Allen| work=Milton Keynes Citizen | url=http://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/sport/hockaday-capture-delight-s-allen-1-858540|accessdate=15 June 2014 }}</ref> where the team reached the League Two play-offs. In May 2007, Martin Allen moved to [[Leicester_City_F.C.|Leicester City]] and on 6 June it was announced that Hockaday would be joining the Leicester City coaching staff.<ref>{{cite news | date=6 June 2007 | title= Allen raids MK Dons for key trio| work= news.bbc.co.uk | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/l/leicester_city/6728077.stm| accessdate=23 June 2007}}</ref>

;格林森林流浪
In September 2009 Hockaday became the first team manager at [[Forest_Green_Rovers|Forest Green Rovers]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/f/forest_green_rovers/8247103.stm |title=Hockaday given Forest Green job |publisher=BBC Sport |date=9 September 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/news/Hockaday-names-Forest-Green-Rovers-manager/article-1324208-detail/article.html |title=Hockaday named as Forest Green Rovers manager |publisher=thisisgloucestershire |date=9 September 2009}}</ref> The job was the first time he had been appointed to a managerial position. He led [[Forest_Green_Rovers|Forest Green Rovers]] to the third round of the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] in his debut season as a manager after overcoming [[Bath_City_F.C.|Bath City]] in the second round.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.thisisgloucestershire.co.uk/Rovers-Cup-dream-alive/story-11874879-detail/story.html |title=Forest Green Rovers keep Cup dream alive |publisher=thisisgloucestershire |date=30 November 2009 |accessdate= 5 July 2011}}</ref> Rovers were knocked out in the third round however by [[League_Two|League Two]] outfit [[Notts_County|Notts County]] meaning Forest Green missed out on the chance to face [[Premier_League|Premier League]] opposition in the shape of [[Wigan_Athletic|Wigan Athletic]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/8466395.stm |title=Notts County 2–1 Forest Green |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 January 2010 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref>

His first season as manager ended with relegation from the [[Conference_Premier|Conference Premier]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/8620926.stm |title=Grays Athletic 2–1 Forest Green Rovers |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 April 2010}}</ref> However, Forest Green were reinstated following [[Salisbury_City_F.C.|Salisbury City]]'s failure in their appeal against demotion from the Conference for financial irregularities. Despite the team finishing in a relegation position and coming under fire from a number of the clubs fans, Hockaday was offered a new one-year contract for the 2010–11 season.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gloucestercitizen.co.uk/Hockaday-pens-new-deal-Forest-Green-boss/story-11865282-detail/story.html |title=Dave Hockaday pens new deal at Nailsworth as Forest Green boss |publisher=Gloucester Citizen |date=19 May 2010}}</ref> In his second season as Forest Green boss the team narrowly avoided relegation to the [[Conference_South|Conference South]] the team lost their final day fixture, a 2–1 loss away at [[Tamworth_F.C.|Tamworth]], but stayed in the league on goal difference.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_conf/9465795.stm |title=Tamworth 2–1 Forest Green Rovers |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2011 |accessdate=30 April 2011}}</ref>

In his third season as Forest Green manager the club finished the season in 10th place. Hockaday's fourth season as manager of the club again ended with another 10th place finish in the [[Conference_Premier|Conference Premier]] despite reportedly having the largest transfer and wage budget in the division.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.thesecretfootballer.com/articles/the-secret-non-league/13923/hockaday-pays-the-price-for-forest-failure/ |title=Hockaday pays the price for Forest failure |publisher=www.thesecretfootballer.com |date=23 October 2013}}</ref> In February 2013, Hockaday dismissed rumours linking him with the vacant managerial post at former club [[Swindon_Town_F.C.|Swindon Town]] after the departure of [[Paolo_Di_Canio|Paolo Di Canio]].<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21519772 |title=Forest Green: Dave Hockaday not interested in Swindon Town job |publisher=BBC Sport |date=20 February 2013}}</ref>

After a disappointing start to the 2013-14 season which saw Forest Green lose seven out of eight games, Hockaday left Forest Green by mutual consent on 21 October 2013.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24611271 |title=Dave Hockaday leaves Forest Green Rovers by mutual consent |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 October 2013 |accessdate=21 October 2013}}</ref>

;列斯聯
On 19 June 2014, Hockaday was appointed head coach of [[Leeds_United_A.F.C.|Leeds United]] on a two-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|title=David Hockaday named as new head coach.  url=http://www.leedsunited.com/news/article/1hylw6lsjl1yn14n6t68sfo7nc/title/united-appoint-new-head-coach|website=Leeds United|accessdate=19 June 2014}}</ref>

He is not popular with fans, and has been called the ugliest manager in the history of both the club and the game of football in general.
