〈'''恐怖替身'''〉（{{lang-en|''Goliad''}}）是《[[探險活寶|探險活寶]]》[[探險活寶_(第四季)|第四季]]的第10集。在[[卡通頻道|卡通頻道]]2012年5月28日播出。本集以[[阿寶·馬頓斯|阿寶]]和[[酷狗老皮|老皮]]為主角。在這一集裡，泡泡糖公主開始擔心死後，並創造一個名為歌莉亞永生的獅身人面像成為她的繼任者。然而，事情出差錯，獅身人面像轉而抵抗泡泡糖。

<!--==劇情==
Princess Bubblegum summons Finn and Jake and explains that, due to her [[Mortal_Recoil|recent brush with death]], she has become aware of her own mortality. Reasoning that she may not always be around for her subjects, she reveals that she has created a candy [[sphinx|sphinx]] named Goliad, from her own [[DNA|DNA]]. Finn and Jake insist that Bubblegum let them teach it about the world and what it means to be a leader, and she lets them, exhausted from her work.

Finn and Jake take Golaid to a [[preschool|preschool]], where the kids are unruly and destructive. After Jake gets angry and aggressively yells at them, Goliad begins to get the wrong impression of what it means to be a leader; she explains to Finn and Jake that, were she to control everyone, the world would be perfect. Goliad then reveals that her head conceals a third eye, with which she uses to psychically control Finn. Once Bubblegum learns that Goliad has gone rogue, she rushes off to solve the problem, leaving Finn and Jake to momentarily hold off the almost-omnipotent sphinx. Nearly bested, Finn and Jake are about to be beaten when Bubblegum returns with a new sphinx named Stormo, made from Finn's DNA. Stormo, being heroic like Finn, sacrifices his life by engaging in eternal psychic combat with Goliad.

==Reception==
"Goliad" aired on [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] on June 4, 2012.

Zack Handlen of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "A–". After lauding the strengths of the series as a whole, Handlen noted, "I’ll admit to being something at a loss as to how to review an episode, but at least I’m pretty sure 'Goliad' was a good one."<ref name=avclubgoliad/> Despite this, he felt that it "didn’t quite come up to the level of glorious madness that the best episodes achieve".<ref name=avclubgoliad/> Handlen called one sequence—wherein Finn tries to prevent himself from thinking of Princess Bubblegum's plan, lest the mind-reading Goliad be able to best him—"the best gag in the episode", largely due to the humorous visuals included in the scene.<ref name=avclubgoliad/> Ultimately, Handlen concluded that the reveal that Stormo was made from Finn's DNA was an example of "a straight-faced-but-still-totally-ridiculous episode" being able to embrace a small moment of heart.<ref name=avclubgoliad>{{cite web|last1=Handlen|first1=Zack|title=Adventure Time: 'Goliad'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-goliad-79715|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
