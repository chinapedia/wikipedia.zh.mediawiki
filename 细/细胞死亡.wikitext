'''細胞死亡'''（Cell death）是描述[[細胞|生物細胞]]永久中止運作生理功能的狀態。細胞死亡可能起因於個體計畫性的細胞死亡，或是因疾病或創傷導致細胞不可逆的損傷而死亡。

[[细胞凋亡|细胞凋亡]]（Apoptosis），又稱第一型細胞死亡，或[[自噬|自噬]] or Type II cell-death are both forms of programmed cell death, while [[壞死|necrosis]] is a non-physiological process that occurs as a result of infection or injury.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kierszenbaum|first=Abraham|title=Histology and Cell Biology - An Introduction to Pathology|year=2012|publisher=ELSEVIER SAUNDERS|location=Philadelphia}}</ref> [[壞死|Necrosis]] is cell death caused by external factors such as trauma or infection, and occurs in several different forms. Recently a form of programmed necrosis, called {{tsl|en|necroptosis||necroptosis}}, has been recognized as an alternate form of programmed cell death. It is hypothesized that necroptosis can serve as a cell-death backup to apoptosis when the apoptosis signaling is blocked by endogenous or exogenous factors such as viruses or mutations.

These changes include {{tsl|en|Bleb (cell biology)||blebbing}}, cell shrinkage, [[细胞核|nuclear]] fragmentation, [[前期|chromatin condensation]], and [[染色体|chromosomal]] [[脱氧核糖核酸|DNA]] fragmentation. It is now thought that – in a developmental context – cells are induced to positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context; the absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for suicide. There appears to be some variation in the morphology and indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways; some treading the path of "apoptosis", others following a more generalized pathway to deletion, but both usually being genetically and synthetically motivated. There is some evidence that certain symptoms of "apoptosis" such as endonuclease activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade, however, presumably true apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated. It is also becoming clear that mitosis and apoptosis are toggled or linked in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received from appropriate growth or survival factors.<ref name="Apoptosis or programmed cell death?">{{cite book|last=D.

Called "non-apoptotic programmed cell-death" (or "[[胱天蛋白酶|caspase]]-independent programmed cell-death" or "necroptosis"), these alternative routes to death are as efficient as apoptosis and can function as either backup mechanisms or the main type of PCD.

Plant cells undergo particular processes of PCD similar to autophagic cell death. However, some common features of PCD are highly conserved in both plants and metazoa.

{{tsl|en|Activation-induced cell death (AICD)||Activation-induced cell death (AICD)}} is a programmed cell death caused by the interaction of Fas receptor (Fas, CD95)and Fas ligand (FasL, CD95 ligand).<ref name="Zhang">Zhang J, Xu X, Liu Y. (2004), Activation-Induced Cell Death in T Cells and Autoimmunity. Cell Mol Immunol. 1(3):186-92</ref> It occurs as a result of repeated stimulation of specific T-cell receptors (TCR) and it helps to maintain the periphery immune tolerance.<ref>Kabelitz D, Janssen O. (1997), Antigen-induced death of T-lymphocytes. Front Biosci. 2:d61-77</ref>  Therefore, an alteration of the process may lead to autoimmune diseases.<ref name="Zhang" /> In the other words AICD is the negative regulator of activated T-lymphocytes.
