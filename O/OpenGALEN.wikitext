'''''Open''GALEN'''是一家非营利性组织。其网站之上提供有一部可供下载的[[开放源码|开源型]]{{le|医学术语集|Medical_terminology}}。该术语集是采用一种称为GRAIL（{{lang|en|GALEN Concept Representation Language}}，GALEN概念表达语言）的[[形式语言|形式化语言]]编制的。
<!-- 
== Background ==
The GALEN technologies were developed with research funding provided by the [[EU|European Community]] Framework III (GALEN Project) and Framework IV (GALEN-In-Use Project) programmes.

Early phases of the GALEN Programme developed the GRAIL concept modelling language, experimented with different structures for the [[GALEN_Common_Reference_Model|GALEN Common Reference Model]], and, in parallel, tested the usefulness of the approach with a series of clinical demonstrator projects.

Later phases of the GALEN Programme, during the late 1990s, have concentrated on robust implementations of GRAIL and the [[Terminology_Server|Terminology Server]], development of the [[GALEN_Common_Reference_Model|GALEN Common Reference Model]] in both scope and detail, and development of tools and techniques to enable the further development, scaling-up and maintenance of the model. An important additional focus has been in developing tools and techniques with which we can map the information found in existing coding and [[Medical_classification|Medical classification]] schemes to the [[GALEN_Common_Reference_Model|GALEN Common Reference Model]].

''Open''GALEN has been set up as a not-for-profit Dutch Foundation by the universities of Manchester and Nijmegen to make the results of the GALEN projects available to the world.

== GALEN Common Reference Model ==

The '''GALEN Common Reference Model''' is the model of medical [[concept|concept]]s (or [[clinical_terminology|clinical terminology]]) being built in GRAIL. This model forms the underlying structural foundation for the services provided by a GALEN [[Terminology_Server|Terminology Server]].

The GALEN Common Reference Model is written in the formal language GRAIL (see below). The GRAIL statements in the model are equivalent with sentences like these:

* Ulcer is a kind of inflammatory lesion
* The process whose outcome is an ulcer is called ulceration
* The stomach is a part of the GI tract
* It is sensible to talk about ulcers located in the stomach
* Ulcers located in the stomach are called Gastric Ulcers
* Ulcers located in the stomach are actually located on the mucosa of the wall of the stomach

The GALEN Common Reference Model is available from the OpenGALEN [[Foundation_(charity)|Foundation]] as open source.

== Projects ==
The GALEN tools and technologies were used in France for the development of the French classification of procedures [[CCAM|Classification Commune des Actes Médicaux]] (CCAM).
