"'''That that is is that that is not is not is that it it is'''"是一個表達[[歧義性|歧義性]]以及[[標點符號|標點符號]]的重要性的英文短語。<ref>{{cite book | last = Wieringa, Moore & Barnes | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =  | title = Procedure Writing: Principles and Practices | publisher = Battelle Press | year = 1993 | location =  | pages = 54 | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=Tm5RAAAAMAAJ&q=%22That+that+is+is+that+that+is+not+is+not+is+that+it+it+is%22&dq=%22That+that+is+is+that+that+is+not+is+not+is+that+it+it+is%22&as_brr=0&pgis=1 | doi =  | id =  | isbn = 0935470689 | access-date = 2012-01-07 | archive-date = 2014-06-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140622092532/http://books.google.com/books?id=Tm5RAAAAMAAJ&q=%22That+that+is+is+that+that+is+not+is+not+is+that+it+it+is%22&dq=%22That+that+is+is+that+that+is+not+is+not+is+that+it+it+is%22&as_brr=0&pgis=1 | dead-url = no }}</ref>

這句「句子」可以通過增加[[標點符號|標點符號]]來分拆成四個句子：
{{quote|
That that is, is.  That that is not, is not.  Is that it?  It is.

(存在的就是存在的，不存在的就是不存在的。就是這樣嗎？是。)}}

還有一個分拆方法：
{{quote|That that is is that that is. Not is not. Is that it? It is.

(那存在的就是那存在的，不是(存在)的就不是(存在)。就是這樣嗎？是。)}}

這是一個[[巴門尼德|巴門尼德]]式的哲學諺語「that all that is, is, and that anything that does not exist does not.(存在的就是存在的，其他所有不存在的就是不存在的。)」這一個短語首先在''{{link-en|Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable|Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable}}''<ref>{{cite book | last = Brewer | first = Ebenezer Cobham | authorlink = Ebenezer Cobham Brewer | coauthors = | title = Dictionary of Phrase and Fable | publisher = Harper | date = 1953 Edition | location = | pages = 896 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = }}</ref>裏出現，但在1959年的短故事"[[獻給阿爾吉儂的花束|獻給阿爾吉儂的花束(Flowers for Algernon)]]"{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}變得有名。Garylin(吉里連)在躺在草地上採摘[[雛菊|雛菊]]以及自言自語時注意了它。

== 變體 ==

一個類似的短語，只有一句句子和一個[[標點符號|標點符號]]：
{{quote|
That that is is that that is not is not that that is that that is is not true is not true.}}

意思：那個『這句句子「那似乎不存在的與那存在的不同」是錯的。』的想法是不對的。

還有一個類似的，長一些的短語：
{{quote|
That that is, is. That that is not, is not. That that is not, is not that that is. Is that not it? It is.

(那存在的就是存在的，不存在的就是不存在的，那不存在的不是那存在的。這樣不是那樣嗎？是。}}

還有一個有三句句子的短語：
{{quote|
That "that is" is that "that is not" is not. Is that it? It is.

(那「這存在」就是相等於「這不是」是錯的。就是這樣嗎？是。)}}

意思：說某東西存在就等同說「那不存在」是錯的。
