==Operations==
Areva NC is based in France and with its subsidiaries has a presence in more than 30 countries. It employs approximately 19,000 people worldwide, with controlling shares still held by the French government.

The [[COGEMA_La_Hague_site|COGEMA La Hague site]], located on the western tip of the [[Cotentin_Peninsula|Cotentin Peninsula]] in [[Normandy|Normandy]], reprocesses spent power reactor fuel to recycle reusable energy materials-uranium and [[plutonium|plutonium]] - and to condition the waste into suitable final form.

Areva NC has uranium reserves in [[Niger|Niger]], Canada, Australia and [[Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan]]. The last mine operation in France, ''La Société des Mines de Jouac'', closed in 2001 when its reserves ran out. Now the company operates uranium mines only in Niger and Canada. It also conducts exploration, primarily in Canada, Niger and central Asia, to replenish its reserves.

===Niger===

====Concessions====
Areva NC's Niger operations consist of three concessions near the town of [[Arlit|Arlit]], runs as joint ventures with (minority) stakeholders from the Nigerian government and smaller foreign investors.  Arlit was in fact built in the midst of the [[Sahara|Sahara]] to support these operations, and has a large expatriate population employed by Areva and its subcontractors.  These ventures are [[Somair|Somair]] (''Société des Mines de l'Aïr'')<ref>[http://www.afdevinfo.com/htmlreports/org/org_50418.html Société des Mines de l'Aïr,: African Development Information] {{wayback|url=http://www.afdevinfo.com/htmlreports/org/org_50418.html |date=20080906175630 |df=y }}.</ref> which operates an open pit uranium mine, and [[COMINAK|COMINAK]] (''Compagnie Minière d'Akouta'').<ref>[http://www.areva-nc.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=cogema_en%2FPage%2Fpage_activite_full_template&c=Page&cid=1039482706706 Areva NC website]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: Mining operations.<br />[http://www.world-nuclear.org/sym/2004/souley.htm Georges Capus, Pascal Bourrelier and Moussa Souley.

==== 2007 conflict with Niger ====
{{main|Tuareg Rebellion (2007–present)}}
On 25 July 2007, the CEO of Areva-Niger, Dominique Pin, was expelled from Niger (although he was in Paris at the time) on charges of supporting the [[Second_Tuareg_Rebellion|Second Tuareg Rebellion]].<ref name=C2/>  According to ''Le Canard enchaîné'', this move from [[Seyni_Oumarou|Seyni Oumarou]]'s government was motivated by negotiations concerning the uranium trade agreement, which was finally renewed on 1 August 2007.<ref name=C2/>  Furthermore, [[Laouel_Kader_Mahamadou|Laouel Kader Mahamadou]], who had resigned from his functions as secretary general of the Nigerien government to take a consulting job with Areva-Niger, was asked by the Nigerian [[DGSE|DGSE]] to remain in Niger instead of flying to France for an integration workshop until a "clarification of the situation" could be obtained.<ref>[http://www.planeteafrique.com/Republicain-Niger/index.asp?affiche=News_Display.asp&ArticleID=4045&rub=Actualit%E9s "Conflit armé dans le nord. Des morts et des réfugiés"], ''[[Le_Républicain-Niger|Le Républicain-Niger]]'', 23 August 2007 {{fr icon}}</ref>

The sporadic fighting in the uranium-producing north halted Areva's Niger mining operations in late 2007, and expansion plans were only beginning to resume in February 2008, while the insecurity and uncertainty remained.

Prior to this, Areva also gained a concession in nearby [[Imouraren|Imouraren]], which is hoped to double or triple their production in Niger. In January 2008, Areva signed a deal to invest over 1 billion euros into its three operations in Niger, increasing the share of revenues going to the government of Niger by 50 percent.<ref>[http://www.reuters.com/article/rbssIndustryMaterialsUtilitiesNews/idUSWEB185320080114?sp=true Areva renews Niger uranium deal, pays 50 pct more].  By Marie Maitre and Abdoulaye Massalatchi: Reuters. Mon 14 January 2008.</ref>  Areva is also being pressured by the opening for the first time of over 100 concessions for uranium mining in Niger, most notably to Canadian and Chinese firms.<ref>Andrew McGregor [http://www.jamestown.org/china_brief/article.php?articleid=2373697  "Mining for Energy: China's Relations with Niger"]. ''China Brief''. Volume 7, Issue 18 (3 October 2007)</ref>

In July 2008, four French workers were kidnapped from Areva operations near Arlit, but quickly released.  Nigerien rebels of the [[Movement_Nigerien_for_Justice|Movement Nigerien for Justice]] (MNJ) operations in early and mid-2008 affected transport of ore from Arlit.  Despite the violence in the Aïr Massif, Areva NC and the Nigerien government were by later 2008 unhindered in their exploitation of the Arlit uranium mines and in the transport of its product by highway to ports in Benin.

====Imouraren mine====
At the beginning of 2009, Niger and the French state mining company agreed a deal to build near Arlit the [[Imouraren_mine|Imouraren mine]]. Areva would hold a 66% stake to the Nigerien mining office's 33%. At a projected output of five thousand tonnes of ore a year, it would be largest uranium mine in the world by 2012, as the SOMAIR and COMINAK mines are phased out. The deal would make Niger the second largest uranium producer in the world, and included plans to construct a civil nuclear power station for Niger.<ref>[http://af.reuters.com/article/nigerNews/idAFL92691720090109?feedType=RSS&feedName=nigerNews&pageNumber=2&virtualBrandChannel=0&sp=true "Uranium-rich Niger eyes nuclear power generation"]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.

====Long term relations====
Areva has been criticised both in Niger and the west for a [[neocolonial|neocolonial]] relationship with the former French colony, having obtained monopoly rights to mine uranium for nearly forty years, while Niger remains (as of 2006) the least developed country in the world.<ref>Guy Martin.

UN Integrated Regional Information Networks (IRIN), 10 October 2007.</ref> There has been speculation that Areva was the primary vehicle (and motivation) for French government involvement in the Nigerien government's poor history of democracy and human rights since the late 1960s.

Areva argues that it is a good steward of the environment and a partner in development with the Nigerien people.
The company stresses that most workers it directly employs in Niger are locals, and that the revenue generated by these mines is the single largest foreign exchange source for Niger.<ref>Two examples include:<br />

Nigerien critics point out that this aid amounted to 0.05% of Areva's annual profits of 428 million euros.<ref>{{cite news | title=Peu enrichi à l'uranium ("Not much enriched by uranium") | work=[[Le_Canard_Enchaîné|Le Canard Enchaîné]] | date=2005-08-03 | url=http://www.canardenchaine.com/accueil.html|language=fr}}</ref>

In January 2008, a Swiss human rights group awarded Areva's Niger operations their "2008 Public Eye Global Award" for the "worst company in the world", citing charges of radioactive pollution, poor working conditions, and the deaths of a number of workers.<ref>[http://www.publiceye.ch/ Swiss human rights group Public Eye] 2008 Public Eye Global Award. <br />

====Cezus====
'''Cezus''' or CEZUS is a subsidiary of Areva NC. It is the company's front-end operation for [[zirconium|zirconium]]. It supplies the company's  Reactors and Services operational unit with the materials needed for the [[nuclear_industry|nuclear industry]]. It produces "zirconium alloy tubes, bars, and sheets for [[pressurized_water_reactor|pressurized water reactor]]s and [[boiling_water_reactor|boiling water reactor]]s".  It forms Areva's Fuel Zirconium Division with the ANF plant in [[Duisburg|Duisburg]], Germany. It operates five sites in France. The commune of [[Ugine|Ugine]] says Cezus is the worldwide number one in zirconium.

=====Jarrie=====
[[Isère|Isère]]. Plant manufactures zirconium sponge through chemical operations and extractible metallurgical processes. It also values derived products issued from the zirconium process such as hafnium salt, magnesium and silicium, as well as zirconium and hafnium oxides and highly pure hafnium.

=====Montreuil-Juigné=====
[[Maine-et-Loire|Maine-et-Loire]]. Plant transforms extruded billets into an extruded tube, the trex.

=====Painboeuf=====
[[Loire-Atlantique|Loire-Atlantique]]. This and Duisburg plants pilder mills the Trex as a fuel rod (claddings and guide tubes). Paimboeuf plant also makes zirconium bars for end caps.

=====Rugles=====
[[Eure|Eure]]. Plant rolls (hot and cold) the slab to coils and strips for the structure of the fuel assembly.

=====Ugine=====
*Cezus' primary research and development center, named CRC, is in [[Ugine|Ugine]], [[Savoie|Savoie]].  Also a service center, it employs 25 engineers and technicians in zirconium-based alloys metallurgy and processes. It has partnerships with the [[French_National_Centre_for_Scientific_Research|French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS) and universities. It conducts research and development of new alloys for fuel assemblies. It develops software for fabrication of zirconium sponge, shaping of zirconium alloys, and conversion processes.
