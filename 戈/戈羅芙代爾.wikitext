'''戈羅芙代爾'''是[[澳大利亞|澳大利亞]][[維多利亞州|維多利亞州]][[吉朗市|吉朗市]]的一個郊區。
原先的移民從德國到來於1849年。至1860年代中葉大約有七十個德裔家庭居住於此，因此獲名字「德國鎮（''Germantown''）」。 	
[[第一次世界大戰|第一次世界大戰]]時因為顧忌澳洲人的反德情緒而改用了今天的名字：即──戈羅芙代爾（''Grovedale''）。<!--''' is a mainly residential southern suburb of [[Geelong,_Victoria|Geelong]], [[Victoria_(Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia|Australia]]. It was renamed from Germantown during the [[Great_War|Great War]]. -->

本郊區的四圍邊界為：沃恩塘溪（''Waurn Ponds Creek''）、羅莎克大道（''Rossack Drive''）、（''Boundary Road''）和巴瓦利路（''Barwarre Road''）。

Grovedale was originally settled by several families of Lutheran German origin who arrived at Corio Bay in 1849. By the mid-1860s there were about 70 families of German origin. There were also two hotels, two flour mills, two tanneries and four wool-washing businesses. A German cottage built in 1854 still stands on the [[Surfcoast_Highway|Surfcoast Highway]].<ref name="cogg">[http://www.geelongcity.vic.gov.au/Visiting%5FGeelong/Towns/Grovedale/ City of Greater Geelong: Grovedale]</ref>

The hilly country and volcanic soil were ideal for orchards and vineyards. The area earned a significant reputation for its wine and was Victoria's largest wine-producing region, thanks to the efforts of Swiss migrants. In September 1915, after the outbreak of the first world war, the South Barwon Council changed the named to Grovedale - the name of a nearby property bought by Alexander Pennell in 1847.<ref name="cogg" />

Residential expansion commenced in Grovedale in the late 1960s, the first housing estates branching off the Surfcoast Highway. Later expansion throughout the 1970s to the 1990s moved to the west along Church Street, Pioneer Road, and Heyers Road. Today development has commenced on the last clear land on the eastern side of the highway, with Grovedale now approaching full development. Future growth is planned for a new suburb to the south, referred to as Armstrong Creek.<ref>[http://www.geelongcity.vic.gov.au/Services_In_Geelong/Planning/Strategic_Planning/Armstrong_Creek_Urban_Growth_Plan/  City of Greater Geelong: Armstrong Creek Urban Growth Plan]</ref>

Grovedale is located on the [[Surfcoast_Highway|Surfcoast Highway]] that links the suburb the centre of Geelong, as well as to the coastal town of [[Torquay,_Victoria|Torquay]]. Pioneer Road runs east west though Grovedale, the road not being completed eastward across the Waurn Ponds Creek until the mid 1990s.<ref>Gregory's 1982-83 Melbourne Street Directory</ref>

Public transport to the area is provided by [[bus|bus]]es operated by [[Benders_Buslines|Benders Buslines]] and [[McHarrys_Buslines|McHarrys Buslines]], on routes to the Geelong city centre travelling via [[Deakin_University|Deakin University]], [[Belmont,_Victoria|Belmont]], [[Highton,_Victoria|Highton]] and [[Waurn_Ponds,_Victoria|Waurn Ponds]].

The 2003–04 Victorian State Budget saw funding made available for an extension of rail services on the [[Geelong_railway_line,_Victoria|line between Melbourne and Geelong]] southwards to Grovedale. A number of options were examined, among them a new [[railway_station|railway station]] at Grovedale on the Surfcoast HIghway.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/5B8CEA11A3D8F676CA2571F800022DAD?OpenDocument |title=Department of Infrastructure: Marshall Railway Station |access-date=2008-01-15 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090604225542/http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/5B8CEA11A3D8F676CA2571F800022DAD?OpenDocument |archive-date=2009-06-04 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> [[Marshall_railway_station,_Victoria|Marshall station]] was opened in 2005 just outside Grovedale on the site of a closed station.<ref>[http://www.railgeelong.com/locations.php?name=Marshall Rail Geelong: Marshall Station]</ref>-->
