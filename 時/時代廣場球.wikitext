'''時代廣場球'''（{{lang-en|'''Times Square Ball'''}}）是位于[[纽约市|纽约市]][[时报广场|时报广场]]的[[報時球|報時球]]。报时球位于[[One_Times_Square|One Times Square]]，其降球仪式是[[跨年夜|跨年夜]]重要的庆祝活动之一。降球仪式于[[北美东部时区|美东时间]]23：59：00开始，降球的60秒中，报时球沿着特殊设计的旗杆下降{{convert|141|ft|m}}，其完全下落标志着新的一年的开始。近年来，降球仪式之前往往会有一些现场演出。

《[[纽约时报|纽约时报]]》的擁有者[[阿道夫·奧克斯|阿道夫·奧克斯]]希望在跨年夜举行一项吸引更多关注的活动，而Walter F. Palmer则提出了设计一个报时球的建议。随后奧克斯雇佣[[Artkraft_Strauss|Artkraft Strauss]]设计出了第一个时代广场球，并在1907年跨年夜举行了第一个降球仪式，以迎接1908年新年。从此以后，降球仪式成为了一项年度特别活动，除了1942年和1943年因世界大战的[[燈火管制|燈火管制]]而取消。另外2020年底2021年初因為[[2019冠狀病毒病疫情|2019冠狀病毒病疫情]]而空場舉行，不開放觀眾入場<ref>{{cite news |title=史上頭一遭！「取消人潮」的紐約時代廣場跨年　只剩工作人員 |url=https://www.mirrormedia.mg/premium/20210102tour001/ |accessdate=2021-12-28 |archive-date=2022-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220419041749/https://www.mirrormedia.mg/premium/20210102tour001/ }}</ref>。

時代廣場球的设计也应灯光技术的进步不断更新换代。最早的時代廣場球内部装有100个[[電燈泡|電燈泡]]，球面由木头和铁构成。而今天，球的内部已经被数字化的[[發光二極管|LED]]照明系统取代，球的表面也变为由三角状的水晶包裹。而现今看到的时代广场球则从2009年开始使用，2008年悬挂的球目前被移至时代广场游客中心展出。

降球仪式由時代廣場聯盟和倒數娛樂组织，<ref name=cbsny-800hard>{{cite web|title=Nearly 800 Hard At Work On Times Square New Year’s Eve Celebration|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/12/29/nearly-800-people-setting-the-stage-for-times-square-new-years-eve-celebration/|work=CBS New York|accessdate=2013-12-31|archive-date=2020-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201230120933/https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2013/12/29/nearly-800-people-setting-the-stage-for-times-square-new-years-eve-celebration/|dead-url=no}}</ref> 是全球最著名的新年庆祝活动之一，每年至少吸引200万人参与，许多电视网络也直播仪式实况。<ref name="Green">{{cite news

After the conclusion of the festivities and the dispersal of attendees, cleanup is performed overnight to remove confetti and other debris from Times Square. When it is re-opened to the public the following morning, few traces of the previous night's celebration remain: following the 2013–14 drop, the [[New_York_City_Department_of_Sanitation|New York City Department of Sanitation]] estimated that it had cleared over 50 tons of refuse from Times Square in eight hours, using 190 workers from their own crews and the Times Square Alliance.<ref>{{cite news|title=Crews Clean Up Times Square After New Year's Celebration|url=http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/01/after-party-in-times-square-comes-the-cleanup/|access-date=2014-12-30|work=CBSNewYork.com|publisher=CBS Radio|date=2014-01-01|archive-date=2014-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141231002506/http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2014/01/01/after-party-in-times-square-comes-the-cleanup/}}</ref>

==歷史==
===早期，第一、二代時代廣場球 (1904~1955)===
{{TransH}}
The first New Year's Eve celebration in [[Times_Square|Times Square]] was held on December 31, 1904; ''[[The_New_York_Times|The New York Times]]''{{'}} owner, [[Adolph_Ochs|Adolph Ochs]], decided to celebrate the opening of the newspaper's new headquarters, [[One_Times_Square|One Times Square]], with a New Year's [[fireworks|fireworks]] show on the southern roof of the building to welcome 1905. Close to 200,000 people attended the event, displacing traditional celebrations that had normally been held at [[Trinity_Church_(Manhattan)|Trinity Church]].<ref name=nyt-deconstructed/> However, following several years of fireworks shows, Ochs wanted a bigger spectacle at the building to draw more attention to the area. The newspaper's chief electrician, Walter F. Palmer, suggested using a [[time_ball|time ball]], after seeing one used on the nearby [[60_Hudson_Street|Western Union Building]].<ref name=nyt-deconstructed/>

Ochs hired sign designer [[Artkraft_Strauss|Artkraft Strauss]] to construct a ball for the celebration; it was built from iron and wood, electrically lit with one hundred [[incandescent_light_bulb|incandescent light bulb]]s, weighed {{convert|700|lb|kg}}, and measured {{convert|5|ft|m}} in diameter. The ball was hoisted on the building's 70 foot flagpole with rope by a team of six men. The ball would begin to drop at 10 seconds before midnight, once it hit the roof of the building, the ball was designed to complete an electric circuit to light a 5-foot-tall sign to light up on all four sides of the building, indicating the new year, and trigger a fireworks show.<ref name=nyt-2000ball/> The first ever "ball drop" was held on December 31, 1907, welcoming the year 1908.<ref name=nyt-deconstructed/>

In 1913, only eight years after it moved to One Times Square, the ''Times'' moved its corporate headquarters to [[The_Times_Square_Building|229 West 43rd Street]]. The ''Times'' still maintained ownership of the tower, however, and Strauss continued to organize future editions of the drop.<ref name=telegraph-history>{{cite news|title=History of Times Square|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8664743/History-of-Times-Square.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8664743/History-of-Times-Square.html |archive-date=2022-01-11 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|publisher=The Telegraph|access-date=2013-01-13|location=London|date=2011-07-27}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

For the 1981-82 event, the ball was modified to make it resemble an apple with red bulbs and a green "stem", alluding to New York's nickname, "[[Big_Apple|the Big Apple]]".<ref name="nyt-deconstructed" /> For the 1987-88 event, organizers acknowledged the addition of a [[leap_second|leap second]] earlier that day (leap seconds are appended at midnight [[Coordinated_Universal_Time|UTC]], which is five hours before midnight in New York) by extending the drop to 61 seconds, and by including a special one-second light show during the extra second.<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert D. |last=McFadden |title='88 Countdown: 3, 2, 1, Leap Second, 0 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/29/nyregion/88-countdown-3-2-1-leap-second-0.html |work=[[The_New_York_Times|The New York Times]] |date=1987-12-31 |access-date=2009-01-02 |archive-date=2022-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220528050233/https://www.nytimes.com/1987/12/29/nyregion/88-countdown-3-2-1-leap-second-0.html }}</ref> The original white bulbs returned to the ball for the 1988-89 event, but were replaced by red, white, and blue bulbs for the 1990-91 event to salute the troops of [[Operation_Desert_Shield_(Gulf_War)|Operation Desert Shield]].<ref name="nyt-deconstructed" />

The third ball was revamped again in 1995 for 1996, adding a computerized lighting system with 180 [[halogen_lamp|halogen bulbs]] and 144 [[strobe_light|strobe light]]s, and over 12,000 [[rhinestone|rhinestone]]s.<ref name="crump"/><ref name=nydn-biggerball>{{cite news|last=Sutton|first=Larry|title=Bigger Ball to Peg Square|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/brighter-ball-peg-square-article-1.703159|work=New York Daily News|access-date=2013-11-06|archive-date=2022-04-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220424220824/https://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/brighter-ball-peg-square-article-1.703159}}</ref> Lighting designer Barry Arnold stated that the changes were "something [that] had to be done to make this event more spectacular as we approach the millennium."<ref name=nydn-biggerball/>

On December 28, 1998, during a press conference attended by New York City mayor [[Rudy_Giuliani|Rudy Giuliani]], organizers announced that the third ball would be retired for the arrival of the new millennium, and replaced by a new design constructed by [[Waterford_Crystal|Waterford Crystal]]. The year 2000 celebrations introduced more prominent sponsorship to the event; companies such as [[Discover_Card|Discover Card]], [[Korbel_Champagne_Cellars|Korbel Champagne]], and [[Panasonic|Panasonic]] were announced as official sponsors of the festivities in Times Square.

A full day of festivities was held at Times Square to celebrate the arrival of the year 2000, which included concerts and hourly cultural presentations with parades of puppets designed by [[Michael_Curry_(puppet_designer)|Michael Curry]], representing countries entering the new year at that hour.

To mark the centenary of the ball drop, a brand new fifth design debuted on New Year's Eve of 2008. Once again manufactured by Waterford Crystal with a diameter of {{convert|6|ft|m}}, and weighing {{convert|1212|lb|kg}}, it uses 9,576 [[LED_lamp|LED lamp]]s provided by [[Philips|Philips]] (which can produce 16,777,216 or 2<sup>24</sup> colors), with computerized lighting patterns developed by the New York City-based firm [[Focus_Lighting|Focus Lighting]]. Organizers stated that the new ball was also more energy-efficient, and consumed an equivalent amount of electricity to 10 [[toaster|toaster]]s.<ref name="Green"/>  The 2008 ball was only used once, and was placed on display at the Times Square Visitors Center following the event.<ref name=nyt-deconstructed/><ref name=nyt-vault/><ref name=cbsny-preparations14/>

For 2009, a larger version of the fifth ball was introduced—an [[icosahedron|icosahedral]] [[Geodesic_dome|geodesic]] sphere lit by 32,256 LED lamps. Its diameter is twice as wide as the 2008 ball, at {{convert|12|ft|m}}, and contains 2,688 Waterford Crystal panels, with a weight of {{convert|11875|lb|kg}}.

Yearly themes for the ball's crystal panels continued; from 2008 to 2013, the ball contained crystal patterns that were part of a Waterford series known as "World of Celebration", which included "Let There Be Light", "Let There Be Joy", "Let There Be Courage", "Let There Be Love", "Let There Be Friendship", and "Let There Be Peace".

From 1956 to 1976, [[CBS|CBS]] televised [[Guy_Lombardo|Guy Lombardo]] and His Royal Canadians' annual New Year's Eve concert, most frequently from the [[Waldorf_Astoria_New_York|Waldorf-Astoria]]'s ballroom. It featured coverage from Times Square, and the band's signature rendition of "[[Auld_Lang_Syne|Auld Lang Syne]]" at midnight.<ref name=nbc-traditions/> After Lombardo's death in 1977, the special continued with Guy's younger brother [[Victor_Lombardo|Victor Lombardo]] as host and bandleader, but increasing competition from ABC's ''New Year’s Rockin’ Eve'' prompted CBS to replace it for 1979–80 with ''[[Happy_New_Year,_America|Happy New Year, America]]''. The new special ran in various formats with different hosts (such as [[Paul_Anka|Paul Anka]], [[Donny_Osmond|Donny Osmond]], [[Andy_Williams|Andy Williams]], [[Paul_Shaffer|Paul Shaffer]], and [[Montel_Williams|Montel Williams]]) until it was discontinued after 1996.
