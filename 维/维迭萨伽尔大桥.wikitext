'''维迭萨伽尔大桥'''（{{lang-bn|বিদ্যসাগর সেতু}} Biddoshagor Shetu）也被称为'''胡格利二号桥'''（{{lang-bn|দ্বিতীয় হুগলী সেতু}} Ditio Hugli Shetu），是位于[[印度|印度]][[西孟加拉邦|西孟加拉邦]]的一座[[斜拉桥|斜拉桥]]，跨越[[胡格利河|胡格利河]]，连接[[加尔各答|加尔各答]]与[[豪拉|豪拉]]。

大桥全长823米，是印度最长的斜拉桥。它是第二座跨越胡格利河的大桥，而第一座是位于该桥以北12公里的[[豪拉大桥|豪拉大桥]]（又名拉宾德拉大桥），建成于1943年。维迭萨伽尔大桥以教育改革家[[潘迪特·伊斯瓦尔·钱德拉·维迭萨伽尔|潘迪特·伊斯瓦尔·钱德拉·维迭萨伽尔]]的名字命名，投资38.8亿[[印度卢比|印度卢比]]建成。

大桥于1979年7月3日动工兴建，1992年10月10日正式交付胡格利河大桥管理局。<ref name="HRBC">{{cite web |url=http://www.hrbc.in/projects1.htm |title=Vidyasagar Setu |accessdate=2013-05-21 |publisher=胡格利河大桥管理局官方网站 |language=en |archive-date=2012-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223125804/http://hrbc.in/projects1.htm |dead-url=no }}</ref><ref name=Bhattacherje_273>{{cite book |last=Bhattacherje |first=S.

==History==
[[File:Vidyasagar-Setu.jpg|thumb]]
Population and commercial activity grew rapidly after India gained independence in August 1947. The only link across the Hooghly River, the [[Howrah_Bridge|Howrah Bridge]], between Howrah and Kolkata, was subject to much traffic congestion, with over 85,000 vehicles every day. This necessitated planning for a new bridge across the river so that it could connect to the major cities of [[Mumbai|Mumbai]] (Bombay), [[Delhi|Delhi]] and [[Chennai|Chennai]] (Madras) through the national highways located close to the bridge.<ref name=shib>{{cite web|url=http://www.shibpurinternational.com/sublink/html/Vidyasagar_Setu.html|title=Vidyasagar setu|accessdate=8 February 2011|publisher=Shibpur International website|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130208182635/http://www.shibpurinternational.com/sublink/html/Vidyasagar_Setu.html|archive-date=2013-02-08|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

The foundation stone for the bridge was laid by [[Indira_Gandhi|Indira Gandhi]] on 20 May 1972.<ref name=Bhattacherje_242>{{harvnb|Bhattacherje|2009|p=242}}</ref> The bridge took more than 22 years to complete and cost [[Indian_Rupees|Indian Rupees]] 3.88 billion,<ref name="Bhattacherje_273"/><ref name=shib/> but in seven of those years there was no construction activity.<ref name=shib/> The bridge is named after the 19th-century [[Bengali_people|Bengali]] educationist reformer Pandit [[Ishwar_Chandra_Vidyasagar|Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]].<ref name="HRBC"/><ref name=History/> Work on the cable-stayed bridge started with the construction of the well curb on the Calcutta bank end on 3 July 1979, and when commissioned on October 10, 1992, it became the longest span bridge of this type in the world.<ref name=Bhattacherje_252>{{harvnb|Bhattacherje|2009|p=252}}</ref> At that time it was the first cable-stayed bridge in India, the largest in [[Asia|Asia]] and the [[List_of_largest_cable-stayed_bridges|third largest in the world]].{{contradiction-inline |reason=See Talk at Contradiction description|date=March 2012}}

==Architectural features and construction==
[[File:Vidyasagar_Setu.png|thumb]]
Vidyasagar Setu is a cable-stayed bridge, with 121 cables in a fan arrangement, built using steel [[Tower#Transportation_support|pylons]] {{convert|127.62|m}} high.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}}<ref name=shib/>  With a total length of {{convert|823|m|ft|0}},<ref name="HRBC"/> Vidyasagar Setu is the longest cable–stayed bridge in India and one of the longest in Asia.<ref name="HRBC"/> The deck is made of composite steel-reinforced concrete with two carriageways. The total width of the bridge is {{convert|35|m}}, with 3 lanes in each direction and a {{convert|1.2|m}}-wide footpath on each side. The deck over the main span is {{convert|457.20|m}} long.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} The two side spans are supported by parallel wire cables and are {{convert|182.88|m}} long.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}}<ref name=shib/> Vidyasagar Setu is a toll bridge with free bicycle lanes. It has capacity to handle more than 85,000 vehicles in a day.<ref name=shib/> The bridge was designed by [[Schlaich_Bergermann_&_Partner|Schlaich Bergermann & Partner]], and checked by Freeman Fox & Partners and Bharat Bhari Udyog Nigam Limited. Construction was carried out by the consortium of Braithwaite, Burn and Jessop (BBJ). The Hooghly River Bridge Commission (HRBC) was responsible for the commissioning operations of the bridge.<ref name="HRBC"/>{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}}<ref name=shib/>

The design of the bridge differs slightly from other bridges, which are of live load composite construction. The difference is in the dead load design concept adopted for this bridge and concreting of the side spans done with support provided by the intermediate trestle. The deck is designed with a grid structure of girders. One set of girders are at the end and another set in the middle, which are braced by girders spaced on an average at {{convert|4.2|m}} centre to centre.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}}
[[File:Vidyasagar_Setu.jpg|left]]
A deck crane was used for the construction of the main span of the bridge. A specially designed crane of 45 tonne capacity was used to erect the pylons of the bridge.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} The structural steel used in the bridge weighs about 13,200 tonnes.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} The pylons, which are {{convert|128|m}} in height, are designed as free standing [[Portal_frame|portal]]s.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} They are provided with two cross portal members, one at the bottom and another at the top, below the pylon head. The deck is connected to the end piers by bolts embedded in the chambers of the piers. Pylons made of 4×4m (13x13ft) steel boxes of riveted construction were raised on the two side spans of the bridge; one set is on the Calcutta side and the other is on the Howrah side.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} The six pylons on the Calcutta side of the bridge were installed using 75 MT and 50 MT cranes, while on the Howrah end, a single 50 MT crane was used. Anchorage of the pylon with the base of piers was effected through [[DYWIDAG_Systems_International|Dywidag]] rods, duly anchored in the piers.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} Cables were erected from the four pylon heads with the help of 32 [[Megatonne|MT]] hoist frames. The hoist frames were mounted on top of each pylon. Sheave blocks, winches and snatch blocks were used to facilitate the lifting, and cables inside the pylons were stressed with jacks. Pressure grouting was performed to fill the voids between the wire and the high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes. A two tonne tower crane, fixed inside the pylons, lifted the cables into position.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} 

[[File:Vidyasagar_Setu_side_Arnab_Dutta_2011.jpg|thumb]]
The bridge has been subject to prototype wind tunnel tests at the [[Indian_Institute_of_Science|Indian Institute of Science]] in [[Bangalore|Bangalore]]. [[Bearing_(mechanical)|Bearings]] are used in vertical and horizontal directions, with grouted collars in four segments at the two end piers and horizontal bearings at the two middle piers to achieve stability against lateral movement. [[Maurer_Söhne|Maurer Söhne]] expansion joints were provided to allow for {{convert|400|mm}} horizontal expansion at the free ends.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} Fixed end slab seal type expansion joints {{convert|115|mm}} were used for horizontal expansion of the joints.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}} Other essential components provided in the bridge structure are the handrails, [[lightning_arrester|lightning arrester]]s, crash barriers, gas service support structures, telephone and electric lines, [[Elevator|lift]]s in the pylons, and a maintenance gantry.{{sfn|Gunguly|Battarcharya|2000|pp=113–4}}

==Post-construction==
Over the years, several accidents have occurred on the bridge resulting in traffic congestion, and sometimes closure of the bridge for a few hours.<ref name=Traffic/> To relieve the heavy traffic congestion at the entry to the bridge, the Hooghly River Bridge Commissioners (HRBC) plan to build two one-way-exit and entry–ramps. These are planned with a semi-circular layout in the form of side wings, which will facilitate easy flow of traffic, before the toll plaza, on roads leading to the [[Howrah_railway_station|Howrah railway station]].<ref name=Traffic>{{cite web |url= http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/keyword/vidyasagar-setu |title=Vidyasagar Setu ramps to decongest traffic |date=28 June 2012 |accessdate=5 January 2013 |publisher=[[The_Times_of_India|The Times of India]]}}</ref> There are also plans to improve the lighting on the bridge by installing [[Light-emitting_diode|LED]] lamps and search lights covering the four pylons, the bridge spans, cables and under-deck. An electronic toll collection system is scheduled to be introduced by 2014, to help improve the flow of traffic across the bridge.<ref name=Traffic/>

The traffic projections for the bridge at the planning stage have not been achieved. A traffic survey carried out for a week during June 2012 recorded traffic of 29,000 vehicles over the bridge in comparison to a projected 85,000. A survey conducted during the same period in June 2012 indicated a figure of 31,865 vehicles, though it is reported by the concerned traffic and transportation engineer that the rate of increase in traffic has been one percent per year on the basis of traffic surveys carried out from the time of commissioning of the bridge. The reason for the fall in traffic during 2012 is attributed to the peak [[monsoon|monsoon]] effect during the survey period.<ref name=Traffic/>
