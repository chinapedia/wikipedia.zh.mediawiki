'''陶德瑞'''（Philip Doddridge，{{bd|1702年|6月26日|1751年|10月26日}}）是18世纪[[英国|英国]]非国教徒领袖和圣诗作者。

==早年==
陶德瑞出生于英国伦敦。他的父亲丹尼尔·多德里奇是一位商人，而据认为对他产生了巨大影响的母亲，是约翰·鲍曼牧师的孤女，鲍曼牧师是一位路德会牧师，因为逃避宗教迫害从[[布拉格|布拉格]]来到英格兰，在英格兰，鲍曼牧师一度担任泰晤河畔金斯顿文法学校的校长。在陶德瑞能够读书之前，他的母亲就开始教他[[旧约|旧约]]和[[新约|新约]]<!-- 的历史 from blue Dutch chimney-tiles。来自荷兰蓝烟囱砖。 -->

陶德瑞最初就读于伦敦的一所小学校，在1712年，进入他外祖父担任校长的泰晤河畔金斯顿文法学校。大约1715年，他转入圣奥尔本斯的另一所私立学校，在那里他深受[[长老会|长老会]]牧师塞缪尔克拉克的影响（另有一位圣公会牧师和哲学家与他同名）。

==在宗教领域的贡献==
陶德瑞具有独立的宗教倾向，拒绝进入培养圣公会牧师的学校，在1719年选择进入非国教徒的莱斯特郡的一所自由学院，接受约翰詹宁斯牧师的教导，1723年毕业。 

当年晚些时候，在非国教徒牧师大会上，陶德瑞被选择开办新成立的Market Harborough学院。同年受邀出任[[北安普敦|北安普敦]]一个独立教会的牧师<!-- Here his popularity as a preacher is said to have been chiefly due to his "high susceptibility, joined with physical advantages and perfect sincerity." His sermons were mostly practical in character, and his aim was to cultivate in his hearers a spiritual and devotional frame of mind. 

在1730s and 1740s 陶德瑞continued his academic and pastoral work, and developed close relations with numerous early religious revivalists and independents, through extensive visits and correspondence.  Through this approach he helped establish and maintain a circle of influential independent religious thinkers and writers, including [[Isaac_Watts|Dr Isaac Watts]]. He also became a prolific author and hymnwriter. In 1736 both 大学s at [[阿伯丁|阿伯丁]] gave him the degree of D.D. However, these multifarious labours led to so many engagements and bulky correspondence that it interfered seriously both with his preaching and academic duties (he had some 200 students to whom he lectured on 哲学和神学, in the mathematical or Spinozistic style). -->

陶德瑞是一位多产的作家。他的《属灵生命在魂中的兴起与长进》（''The Rise and Progress of Religion in the Soul''）被翻译为7种语言。[[司布真|司布真]]将《属灵生命在魂中的兴起与长进》称为“那本神圣的书”<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=u2I6TWXFEmQC&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=spurgeon+rise+and+progress&source=web&ots=q5srHVChE-&sig=aQ8NUDz7OrrWKQIkw_PWD6OjAZk&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=1&ct=result</ref>。[[废奴主义|废奴主义]]者[[威廉·威尔伯福斯|威廉·威尔伯福斯]]阅读此书后，成为一名福音派基督徒。 除了一本新约注释和其他神学作品外，多德里奇还写了400多首赞美诗。其中大多数赞美诗是他布道的摘要，帮助信徒表达他们对所接受真理的回应<ref>http://www.ccel.org/d/doddridge/</ref>。

==去世和遗产==
1751年，陶德瑞的身体崩溃了，这一年9月30日，他前往[[里斯本|里斯本]]；但是这一努力是徒劳的，他在那里去世了。

陶德瑞致力于一个统一的非国教徒的机构，将产生广泛的吸引力。他具有高度的文化修养，但并没有疏远那些教育程度较低者。 

他最著名的作品《属灵生命在魂中的兴起与长进》（1745年）<!-- , dedicated to [[Isaac_Watts|Isaac Watts]], was often reprinted and became widely influential. It is said to best illustrate his religious genius, and has been widely translated. His other well-known works include: ''The Family Expositor'' (6 vols., 1739-1756); ''Life of Colonel Gardiner'' (1747); and a ''Course of Lectures on Pneumatology, Ethics and Divinity'' (1763). Doddridge also published several courses of sermons on particular topics. -->  

他的许多圣诗，如《于伯特利出现的神》（''O God of Bethel, by whose hand''），至今仍在英语世界使用。

<!-- 陶德瑞的 academy is now represented by [[New_College,_Hampstead|New College, Hampstead]], in the library of which there is a large collection of his manuscripts. (Note:  New College, Hampstead was later known as [[New_College_London|New College London]], and was a centre for training Congregational and then United Reformed Church Ministers. It has no connection with [[Royal_Holloway,_University_of_London|Royal Holloway, University of London]], a constituent college of [[伦敦大学|伦敦大学]], though the college was briefly known as ''Royal Holloway and Bedford New College'' when those two colleges merged in the 1970s.) -->
