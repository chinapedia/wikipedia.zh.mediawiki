'''教育哲學'''是对[[教育|教育]]问题的[[哲学|哲学]]思考，用哲学的方法和语言来研究教育问题。研究的对象包括教育的本質、目的、學習的歷程、知識的架構、人類的課題、權威的問題、教育和社會之間的關係、教育的方針等等。<ref>{{cite web |author1=李奉儒 |title=教育哲學 |url=http://terms.naer.edu.tw/detail/1309874/ |website=國家教育研究院 |publisher=國家教育研究院 |location=臺灣 |language=zh-hant |date=2000年12月 |access-date=2020-11-01 |archive-date=2020-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200810060915/http://terms.naer.edu.tw/detail/1309874/ |dead-url=no }}</ref>

教育哲學認為人民素養和文化的傳承、演變大多取決於教育，而教育孩子及公民都是很大的挑戰，因為教育的過程不僅是一些[[班級經營|班級經營]]方法，還涉及倫理學、政治學、心理學、美學和經濟學等不同面向。

自從[[让-雅克·卢梭|讓-雅克·盧梭]]開始，'''教育哲学'''开始跟[[发展心理学|发展心理学]]发生联系。盧梭在《[[愛彌兒|愛彌兒]]》一書中，認為人有與生俱來的學習能力，教育的過程應該是以孩子為中心，從旁協助他對世界的主動探索，而不是由成人來主導一切。
 

<!--基本上教育的目的涉及了:

# The enterprise of [[civil_society|civil society]]致力于将年轻人教育成为 [[responsibility|responsible]], [[thought|thought]]ful and [[enterprise#psychology|enterprising]] [[公民|公民]]。This is an intricate, challenging task requiring deep understanding of [[ethics|ethical]]原则, [[道德|道德]][[价值|价值]]、[[政治|政治]]理论, [[aesthetics|aesthetics]]和[[经济|经济]]; not to mention an understanding of who [[儿童|儿童]] are, in themselves and in [[社会|社会]]. 
# Progress in 每个 practical 领域 depends upon having capacities that [[school|school]]ing can educate.教育 thus is a means to fostering the individual's,社会's, and 甚至[[人类|人类]]的未来发展和[[繁荣|繁荣]]. Emphasis is often put on 经济[[社会_status|success]] in this regard.
# 個人的充份發展以獨之自主的能力。 據此，教育可做為通往[[馬斯洛|馬斯洛]][[自我實現|自我實現]]的堅實基礎。

A chronological summary of the work of some of 最重要 and influential [[西方文化|西方文化]]教育哲学 follows.-->

== 東方的教育哲學 ==

=== 儒家 ===
在春秋時期的中國，[[孔子|孔子]]提出有教無類的教育原則。道德上，以[[仁|仁]]為目標，「忠」（敬事）和「恕」（同理）為基礎，強調已所不欲，勿施於人。[[孔子|孔子]]的教育思想中，認為天道、人德、禮樂和人生智慧比知識重要，提出志於道、據於德、依於仁、遊於藝的實踐方式，並透過[[六藝|六藝]]來鍛鍊身心。[[孔子|孔子]]的教育思想記錄在《[[論語|論語]]》中。

孔子認為「知之為知之，不知為不知，是知也」，學習者能認清自己的局限是很重要的。

戰國時代的儒者[[荀子|荀子]]在〈勸學篇〉提出，教育和學習是為了超越人趨於惡的天性，建立人為的善，以達成公共秩序和個人的知識、修養。

儒家思想雖有不同派別，都一致同意教育的目的是《[[大學|大學]]》提到的明明德，以協助個人自身的提升（內聖，[[自我實現|自我實現]]）推廣到治理天下（外王）為方法。

在明朝，儒家分為[[程頤|程頤]]、[[朱熹|朱熹]]的[[理學|理學]]和[[陸象山|陸象山]]、[[王陽明|王陽明]]的[[心學|心學]]。理學中強調透過明辨外在的事物來充實知識、體悟人生，因此學習的重點是分析客觀的世界。[[心學|心學]]中強調知行合一，較重視內在的[[修行|修行]]、致良知而較不重視分析客觀的世界。

=== 道家 ===
春秋時代的哲學家[[老子|老子]]提出無為而治、不言之教的教育觀。[[老子|老子]]提出生而不有、為而不恃、長而不宰的方法，認為萬物自然會成長，學習者自然會學習，教育者應扮演協助的角色而不是引導或控制。這對[[自主學習|自主學習]]的思想產生了影響。

[[老子|老子]]和[[孔子|孔子]]一樣，認為學習者應瞭解自己的局限。

=== 佛家 ===
主張人原本皆具足無量智慧與善良本性(以電腦比喻，電腦本身可以寫入完美的程式),只是因為累世以來業力蓄積,影響了原本的通達思考與良知良能(即剛開始寫入的程式並不完美，而且後面寫入的程式還受到前面的程式的影響).若能經常加以修行,即能保有一定的修為(不斷的修編程式達到完美),不至於因世事矇蔽而墮入六道輪迴,直至成佛.(將程式寫至完美便不再需要修改)

[[淨土宗_(中國)|淨土宗]]有一說法，常念"南無[[阿彌陀佛|阿彌陀佛]]"達到一心不亂，可以前往阿彌陀佛的無量壽佛國，也就是大家常說的[[西方極樂世界|西方極樂世界]]，在那裡學習直至[[一生補處菩薩|一生補處菩薩]]的境界，好來生成佛.

===Movements===
====古典教育====
<!--
The [[Classical_education_movement|Classical education movement]] advocates（倡导） a form of education based in the traditions of Western culture, with a particular focus on education as understood and taught in the Middle Ages. 
古典教育是中世纪意义的教育形式，倡导基于西方传统文化的教育。

The term "classical education" has been used in English for several centuries, with each era modifying the definition and adding its own selection of topics. 
在英语中，古典教育（classical education）这个短语已经使用了几个世纪，在不同的时代它的含义在不断变化并加入不同的时代教育主题。

By the end of the 18th century, in addition to（除了） the trivium((中世纪学校的)三学科(语法、逻辑、修辞)学科） and quadrivium (中世纪大学的)四高级学科(算术、几何、天文、音乐)。of the Middle Ages, the definition of a classical education embraced the study of literature, poetry, drama, philosophy, history, art, and languages. 


In the 20th and 21st centuries it is used to refer to a broad-based study of the liberal arts and sciences, as opposed to a practical or pre-professional program. -->

===教育哲学家===


==== 柏拉图 ====

[[柏拉圖|柏拉圖]]是第一位重要的教育思想家。教育在他的整體哲學視野中只佔一小部分，卻是很重要的一部分。他認為教育是創造和傳承他的理想國的一把鑰匙。

他主張讓孩子遠離個別母親的照顧，接受整個社群的共同看护和公立的教育。透過教育的過程，一面培養孩子的知識和能力，一面觀察他們，依照其能力分為不同的社會等級，最高的接受最多的教育，以使他們成為城市的領袖和衛士。

一般的教育的內容以體育、音樂和數學為主。領袖的教育還包含哲學、遊歷（考察社會現象）等。


<!--physical discipline, and rigidly censored music and art.-->
 


<!--For Plato the individual was best served by being subordinated to a just society. Plato's belief that talent was distributed non-genetically and thus must be found in children born to all classes moves us away from aristocracy, and Plato builds on this by insisting that those suitably gifted are to be trained by the state so that they may be qualified to assume the role of a ruling class. What this establishes is essentially a system of selective public education premised on the assumption that an educated minority of the population are, by virtue of their education (and inborn educability), sufficient for healthy governance.

柏拉图可以作為民主教育的哲学基礎 both because later key thinkers treat him as such, and because, while Plato's 方法 are autocratic and his motives meritocratic, he nonetheless prefigures much later democratic 教育哲学。This is different in degree rather than kind from most versions of, say,美国 experiment with democratic 教育, which has 往往假定只有一部份的學生應該接受最充分的學術教育，而其他人則視其能力，而接受不同性質的教育.-->
==== 亚里斯多德 ====
参见：[[亞里士多德|亞里士多德]].

<!--Though 亞里士多德 wrote a treatise ''论教育'', this only survives through fragments that have come down to us. We thus know of 他的教育哲学 primarily through brief passages in other works. 亞里士多德认为 nature、习惯和 reason to be 3个同等重要的forces to be cultivated in education. Thus,例如，他认为 repetition to be a key tool to develop 好习惯。教师 was to lead the student systematically; this differs, for example, from 苏格拉底' emphasis on questioning his listeners to bring out their own ideas (though the comparison is perhaps unfair since Socrates was dealing with adults)。 

亞里士多德placed great emphasis on 平衡 the theoretical and practical aspects of subjects taught. Subjects he explicitly mentions as being 重要 包括阅读、写作和数学; 音乐;物理教育;文学和历史; and a wide range of sciences。He also mentioned 重要性 of play.

One of 教育的 primary missions for亞里士多德，perhaps its 最重要, was to produce good and virtuous citizens for the polis. ''All who have meditated on the art of governing mankind have been convinced that the fate of empires depends on 教育 of youth.''-->

==== 卢梭 ====

尽管[[让-雅克·卢梭|盧梭]](1712-78)對柏拉圖的哲學十分尊敬，但也拒絕了它。它因為社會腐朽而變得不切實際。盧梭卻對人類發展有另外一種理論，
<!--柏拉图认为人 are born with skills appropriate to different castes (though he did not regard these skills as being inherited), 卢梭却-->
认为存在着一个所有人共同的發展過程。這是一個內在而自然的過程是源於求知慾。這是驅使孩子去學習及適應環境的天性。
<!--the primary 行为 manifestation was curiosity. This differed from 洛克's ''[[tabula_rasa|tabula rasa]]'' in that it was an active process deriving from the child's nature, which drove the child to learn and adapt to its 环境。

卢梭在他的著作''[[爱弥儿|爱弥儿]]''中，所有儿童 are perfectly designed organisms, ready 学习 从环境 so as to grow into virtuous adults. But, due to the malign influence of corrupt society, they often failed to do so. Rousseau advocated an educational method which consisted of removing the child from society (i.e., to a country home) and alternately conditioning him through changes to environment and setting traps and puzzles for him to solve or overcome.

卢梭是不平凡的，因为他认识 and addressed the potential of a problem of legitimation for teaching. He advocated that adults always be truthful with children, and in particular that they never hide the fact that the basis for their authority in teaching was purely one of physical coercion--"I'm bigger than you." Once children reached the age of reason (about 12), they would be engaged as free individuals in the ongoing process of their own.-->

==== 杜威 ====
参见：[[约翰·杜威|约翰·杜威]]

==== Rudolf Steiner ====

<!--[[Rudolf_Steiner|Rudolf Steiner]] (1861-1925), a 哲学家和作家, created a holistic 教育 impulse that has become known as [[Waldorf_教育|Waldorf 教育]]. He emphasizes a balance of 发展智力(或head)、情感和 artistic life (or heart), and practical skills (or hands)。教育 focuses on producing free individuals, and Steiner expected it to enable a new, freer social order to arise, through the creative, free 人类 that it would develop.

Waldorf 教育is based on Steiner的哲学，known as [[anthroposophy|anthroposophy]], and 将教育分为three discrete 发展阶段; these stages predate but have close similarities to [[皮亚杰|皮亚杰]]的儿童发展阶段. 

第一个阶段 is early childhood, normally lasting 6-7 years. In this stage, which emphasizes practical skills and concrete experiences, imitation is the primary educative force, and an environment replete with healthy impulses and especially practical work - crafts, gardening, cooking, cleaning, woodwork, and much more - is regarded as the ideal educational setting for the pre-school and kindergarten years. Language development is fostered through story-telling, verse and movement and/or finger games, i.e. primarily imitatively. The children are given opportunities for free play both inside and outside; this is considered vital for their healthy development, as this is the way they digest their impressions and develop their will forces, feeling life and intellect in an age-appropriate manner. 

第二个阶段从入学（6－7岁）开始，until puberty. Here, education is best achieved through appeal to the child's imagination; development of the children's feeling and artistic life is strongly emphasized. The teacher's authority is established through guiding the child wisely and sensitively, but clearly; there is great worth placed upon establishing this sense in the child of having found a true authority in the teacher. There is a balance between academic, artistic and practical (crafts) subjects. The arts play an especially large role at this time; all subjects are to be presented with artistic feeling and permeated with imaginative approach. Two foreign languages are normally taught from first grade on. Generally the attempt is made to keep a main teacher with a class for longer periods of time, often from first grade right through the end of the elementary school.

第三个阶段from puberty 到 end of childhood, 或从13-14岁到20-21岁。Here, the authority of the earlier years 不再 a viable pedagogical tool; instead, idealism becomes the key force of education. The children's intellectual development is now intensively fostered and their sense of judgement called upon. Great worth is placed upon avoiding early specialization; even in the secondary school,所有学生are normally expected to take a full range of academic courses (包括物理、化学、生物学、geology,数学、历史、art history和文学),1－2门外语、美术、crafts,音乐(frequently both orchestral and choral), physical 教育 and a movement discipline special to the schools ([[eurythmy|eurythmy]])。教师are specialized according to the discipline and 教育 should introduce the adolescent to the larger world as much as possible. Foreign exchanges and work experience are both thus common elements of the secondary school.

通过教育，a great importance is placed upon having free and creative individuals as 教师; thus,学校 should have an appropriate amount of freedom to shape their own curriculum and teachers should have a corresponding freedom to shape the daily life of the classroom. In order for such a system to function, intensive work must take place both amongst teachers within schools and between schools to provide the necessary communication, training and development.

Waldorf 教育 includes a respect for children's physical nature, rhythmic life (technical term: [[ether_body|ether body]]), consciousness (technical term: [[astral_body|astral body]]) and individuality ([[ego|ego]]). Anthroposophy includes teachings about [[reincarnation|reincarnation]] and schools often try to foster an awareness that each human being - and thus each child - carries a unique being into this earthly life. 

As both an 独立教育 model and a 重要影响 upon other educators - such as [[Maria_蒙特梭利|Maria 蒙特梭利]] - Waldorf 教育 is currently both 世界上最大和成长最快的教育运动之一. Waldorf schools are also increasingly operating as state-funded (in 美国''charter'') schools or even state-run (in 美国 public) schools.-->

==== 斯金纳 ====
[[斯金纳|斯金纳]](1904-1990)对教育哲学的一个贡献 
<!--is his text [[Walden_Two|Walden Two]] wherein he details 社会和教育的失败, as one is intricately and intrinsically linked to the other. 
教育方法[[Direct_Instruction|Direct Instruction]]和[[Precision_Teaching|Precision Teaching]] owe much to his ideas. [[行为主义|行为主义]]理论 play largely in his proposed ideas of [[社会engineering_(political_science)|社会engineering (political science)]].

Precision Teaching, developed by 斯金纳的学生Ogden Lindsley, uses the basic 哲学 that the "learner knows best". Each learner is charted on a unique graph known as a "Standard Celeration Chart". The record of the rate of learning is tracked by this charting and decisions can be made from these data concerning changes in an educational program.-->
 


<!--=== Freire ===
A 巴西人 who became committed to the cause of educating the impoverished peasants of his nation and [[collaboration|collaborating]] with them in the pursuit of their liberation from oppression, [[Paulo_Freire|Paulo Freire]] (1921-97) contributes a 教育哲学 that comes not only from the more classical approaches stemming from Plato, but also from modern Marxist and anti-colonialist thinkers. In fact, in many ways his ''Pedagogy of the Oppressed'' may best be read as an extension of or reply to [[Frantz_Fanon|Frantz Fanon]]'s ''Wretched of the Earth'', which laid strong emphasis on the need to provide native populations with an 教育 which was simultaneously new and 现代(rather than traditional) and anti-colonial (that is, that was not simply an extension of the culture of the colonizer). 

Freire is best-known for his attack on what he called the [[banking_concept_of_教育|banking concept of 教育]], in which 学生 was viewed as an empty account to be filled by the teacher. Of course, this is not really a new move--Rousseau's conception of the child as an active learner was already a step away from the ''[[tabula_rasa|tabula rasa]]'' (which is basically the same as the "banking concept"), and thinkers like [[John_杜威|John 杜威]] and [[Alfred_North_Whitehead|Alfred North Whitehead]] were strongly critical of the transmission of mere facts as 教育目标。

More challenging, however, is Freire's strong aversion to the teacher-student dichotomy. This dichotomy is admitted in Rousseau and constrained in Dewey, but Freire comes close to insisting that it should 完全 abolished. Of course, this is strictly inconceivable in absolute terms (there must be some enactment of the teacher-student relationship in the parent-child relationship), but what Freire suggests is that a deep reciprocity be inserted into our notions of 教师和学生. Freire wants us to think in terms of 教师-student and 学生-teacher, that is,学习的教师和教导的学习者，as 课堂的基本 roles  participation.

This is one of the few attempts anywhere to implement something like democracy as an educational method and not merely a goal of democratic education. Even Dewey, for whom democracy was a touchstone, did not integrate democratic practices fully into his methods. (Though this is in part a function of his peculiar attitudes toward individuality.) However, in its early, strong form this kind of classroom has sometimes been criticized on the grounds that it can mask rather than overcome the teacher's authority.

Freire's work is widely-read by educationalists but is less well-respected among philosophers.

Aspects of the Freirian philosophy have been highly influential in academic debates over 'participatory development' and development more generally. Freire's emphasis on emancipation through interactive participation has been used as a rationale for the participatory focus of development, as it is held that 'participation' in any fora can lead to empowerment of poor or marginalised groups. Critics argue that the inherently undemocratic, unequal nature of development projects foreclose any possibility of Freirian emancipation, but many cling to the 'empowering potential' of development.-->


<!--=== Neil Postman and the Inquiry Method ===
[[Neil_Postman|Neil Postman]] has been a strong contemporary voice in both methods and philosophy of education.His 1969 book "Teaching as a Subversive Activity" (co-authored with Charles Weingartner) introduced the concept of a school driven by the [[Inquiry_Method|Inquiry Method]], the basis of which is to get the students themselves to ask and answer relevant questions.  The "teacher" (the two authors disdained the term and thought a new one should be used) would be limited in the number of declarative sentences he could utter per class, as well as questions he personally knew the answer to.  The aim of this type of inquiry would be to prepare the students to lead responsible adult lives, primarily by functioning as an antidote to the rampant bureaucracy most adults are faced with after leaving school.

Postman went on to 写基本重要的书 on education, notably "Teaching as a Conserving Activity"和"The End of Education."  The latter deals with the importance of goals or "gods" to students, and Postman suggests several "gods" capable of replacing the current ones offered in schools, namely, [[经济_Utility|经济 Utility]]和[[Consumerism|Consumerism]].-->

== Critical responses and counter-哲学 ==


<!--Critics have accused 教育哲学 of being one the weakest subfields of both [[哲学|哲学]]和[[教育|教育]], disconnected from 哲学(by being insufficiently rigorous for the tastes of many "real" 哲学家) and from the broader study and practice of education (by being 太哲学化、太理论化)。its proponents state that it is an exacting and critical branch of 哲学 and 指出重要的哲学家很少没有写到教育，认为教育哲学不是必需的。例如，[[柏拉图|柏拉图]] undertakes to discuss all these elements in ''The Republic'', beginning the formulation of educational philosophy that endures today. 

=== Hannah Arendt ===
[[Hannah_Arendt|Hannah Arendt]] largely avoided 教育 as a subject, but she did so for reasons which are very interesting to 教育哲学. Her thoughts on the subject are recorded in one of the essays collected in ''Between 过去 and Future'', entitled, "教育的危机" In this essay, Arendt proceeds to argue that '''any''' attempt to create democracy through 教育方法 was a form of tyranny... (Continuation pending

=== E.D. Hirsch ===
[[E.D._Hirsch|E.D. Hirsch]] would surely identify himself as someone interested in educating for democracy, but he is grouped separately here because 他的哲学 is basically a counter to Deweyan pragmatic education, and because, like Arendt, he is concerned with preparing children for an existing order, rather than working towards a new one, let alone instituting the practice of democracy as a part of education. Hirsch is responsible for promoting [[文化literacy|文化literacy]] movement.-->


威權體制教育指的是升學主義和管理主義思維下的學校體制。它的特色是：學生對師長的絕對服從、量化的考試成績做為衡量人的價值的主要量尺、幾乎沒有空堂或自由選課的時間、學生的生活規範多半由成人制定和執行。簡單來說，威權體制教育將學生為自己做決定的空間壓縮得很小，而將成人的價值強加在學生身上。為了方便管理，許多不符合教育原則的事也可能發生。其中最為惡名招彰的是體罰。

== 自主學習 ==
自主學習是一種[[教育|教育]]與[[學習|學習]]的哲學，同時是一門[[藝術|藝術]]。相較於其他教育學派，自主學習者認為沒有人能替別人作決定。這與許多教育的現況看似矛盾，因為成人總認為自己有權替孩子作決定，特別是在他們還小的時候。

從自主學習者的角度來看，他人所給予的只有資源和限制，但如何在這些條件下抉擇，以何種價值觀來抉擇，則是學習者自己的事，旁人最多只能提供建議，不能替他抉擇，也不能替他判斷什麼對他好，什麼對他不好。
