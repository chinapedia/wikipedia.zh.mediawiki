《'''教會唯一的根基'''》（{{lang-en|The Church's One Foundation}}），是一首由[[撒母耳·約翰·斯通|撒母耳·約翰·斯通]]撰寫的[[基督教|基督教]][[聖詩|聖詩]]。

這詩歌直接回應首任[[納塔爾主教|納塔爾主教]][[約翰·威廉·哥倫素|約翰·威廉·哥倫素]]當時被認為偏離正道的教導，他在[[南非聖公會|南非聖公會]]製造了內部紛爭。<ref>{{cite web

}}</ref>歌詞第四段「雖她受盡了困難，旁人嘲笑譏評，內爭分裂了她身，異端叛道離經」([[普天頌讚|普天頌讚]]版)點出了這主題。哥倫素主教因他的教導而被撤職，但他向英格蘭的更高教會機構上訴。

就在這時，約翰·斯通被牽涉入爭辯當中。這啟發了他1866年撰寫了以[[使徒信經|使徒信經]]為基礎的一套詩歌。他為詩歌命名為「Lyra Fidelium；使徒信經十二節的十二首詩歌」，《教會唯一的根基》就是根據第九節「神聖大公教會；聖徒相通」創作的。

歌譜通常是[[撒母耳·薩巴士田·衛斯理|撒母耳·薩巴士田·衛斯理]]選定的「Aurelia」。<ref>http://books.google.com/books?id=kN-FilvMftwC&printsec=frontcover&dq=101+Hymn+Stories+by+Kenneth+W.+Osbeck&hl=en&sa=X&ei=KZduUpHYGZPwkQfbg4CAAQ&ved=0CFIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=101%20Hymn%20Stories%20by%20Kenneth%20W.%20Osbeck&f=false</ref>

==歌詞==

:1 The Church's one foundation
:Is Jesus Christ her Lord,
:She is His new creation
:By water and the Word.
:From heaven He came and sought her
:To be His holy bride;
:With His own blood He bought her
:And for her life He died.

:2 She is from every nation,
:Yet one o'er all the earth;
:Her charter of salvation,
:One Lord, one faith, one birth;
:One holy Name she blesses,
:Partakes one Holy Food,
:And to one Hope she presses,
:With every grace endued.

:3 The Church shall never perish!
:Her dear Lord to defend,
:To guide, sustain, and cherish,
:Is with her to the end:
:Though there be those who hate her,
:And false sons in her pale,
:Against or foe or traitor
:She ever shall prevail.

:4 Though with a scornful wonder
:Men see her sore oppressed,
:By schisms rent asunder,
:By heresies distressed:
:Yet saints their watch are keeping,
:Their cry goes up, "How long?"
:And soon the night of weeping
:Shall be the morn of song!

:5 'Mid toil and tribulation,
:And tumult of her war,
:She waits the consummation
:Of peace forevermore;
:Till, with the vision glorious,
:Her longing eyes are blest,
:And the great Church victorious
:Shall be the Church at rest.

:6 Yet she on earth hath union
:With God the Three in One,
:And mystic sweet communion
:With those whose rest is won,
:With all her sons and daughters
:Who, by the Master's Hand
:Led through the deathly waters,
:Repose in Eden land.

:7 O happy ones and holy!
:Lord, give us grace that we
:Like them, the meek and lowly,
:On high may dwell with Thee:
:There, past the border mountains,
:Where in sweet vales the Bride
:With Thee by living fountains
:Forever shall abide! Amen
