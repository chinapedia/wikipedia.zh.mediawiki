Alenia的'''G.222'''為一種中型[[短場起降|短場起降]]軍用[[運輸機|運輸機]]。原本是為滿足[[北約|北約]]的要求而研發，但最初只有[[義大利|義大利]]一個北約成員國採用此機。但是該機架構在1990年代與[[美國|美國]]廠商合作改良，成為[[C-27J斯巴達人戰術運輸機|C-27J斯巴達人運輸機]]，並得到國際市場的青睞。

G.222設計採用了運輸機的常見構型：高單翼，雙[[渦輪發動機|渦輪旋槳發動機]]，尾部跳板。其裝貨甲板的尺寸是為標準的[[463L|463L]] 貨盤而規劃；機艙底板設有一個供空投使用門；設有供醫療作業用的內置的輸氧系統；並在側門有為傘兵跳傘而設平台。

==發展==
{{transH}}
[[1962年航空|1962年]]，北大西洋公约组织issued a specification for a [[垂直短場起降|垂直短場起降]](V/STOL) transport aircraft (NATO Basic Military Requirement 4), but none of the various submissions resulted in a production contract. The [[意大利空軍|意大利空軍]](Aeronautica Militare), however, felt that the [[Aeritalia|Aeritalia]] proposal was worthy of development and ordered two prototypes plus a ground-test airframe in [[1968_in_aviation|1968]]. These aircraft were slightly simplified from Aeritalia's original proposal. The first prototype flew on [[July_18|July 18]] [[1970_in_aviation|1970]] and the Air Force began evaluating the two prototypes at the end of December [[1971_in_aviation|1971]]. Testing proved highly successful, and a contract for 44 aircraft was issued, the first entering service in April [[1978_in_aviation|1978]].

The G.222 is one of the few cargo planes capable of flying loops and other stunt maneuvers such as flying at about 90 km/h (with the cargo door in the back open) and short track landing (takes only about 300 m to stop the plane after touching the ground when it is empty, as seen on the Airpower 2005 in Zeltweg, Austria).

1990年，[[美國空軍|美國空軍]]selected the G.222 as the basis of a "Rapid-Response Intra-Theater Airlifter" (RRITA). 美軍購買了十架G.222sand underwent avionics upgrades by [[Chrysler|Chrysler]]. These aircraft were stationed at [[Howard_AFB|Howard AFB]], [[Panama|Panama]], but were withdrawn from service in [[1999_in_aviation|1999]] due to high maintenance costs.

===C-27J 斯巴逹人===
{{transH}}
In [[1997_in_aviation|1997]], [[Alenia|Alenia]] and [[Lockheed_Martin|Lockheed Martin]] formed '''Lockheed Martin Alenia Tactical Transport Systems''' for the development of an advanced version of the G.222 with advanced avionics, a [[glass_cockpit|glass cockpit]] and new engines, the same [[Rolls-Royce_AE_2100|Rolls-Royce AE 2100]]s that power the [[C-130_Hercules|C-130J Hercules]]. 

The C-27J has a 35% increase in range and a 30% increase in service ceiling over the original G.222. The [[Italian_Air_Force|Italian Air Force]] and the [[Hellenic_Air_Force|Hellenic Air Force]] have ordered twelve aircraft each, and the [[Bulgarian_Air_Force|Bulgarian Air Force]] has selected C-27J for a requirement of eight. Alenia is offering [[Canada|Canada]] the C-27J as a [[CC-130_Hercules|CC-130 Hercules]] and [[CC-115_Buffalo|CC-115 Buffalo]] replacement. Lithuania ordered three C-27J as [[AN-26|AN-26]] replacement. First plane to be delivered at the end of 2006. 

Global Military Aircraft Systems (GMAS), a joint venture between L-3 Communications and Alenia Aeronautica, along with Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, is currently promoting the C-27J heavily for selection as the U.S. Army and Air Force's [[Joint_Cargo_Aircraft|Joint Cargo Aircraft]] (JCA), competing with Raytheon and EADS North America's the [[CN-235|CN-235/295]]. Both the U.S. Army and Air Force JCA orders combined are expected to top 100 aircraft. The JCA will eventually replace the existing [[Shorts_330|C-23 Sherpa]] and [[C-12_Huron|C-12 Huron]].<ref>"C-27J successfully completes Army, Air Force early user survey", ''Aerotech News and Review'', 2006-12-01</ref>

By November, 2006, the C-27J had completed the U.S. [[United_States_Department_of_Defense|Department of Defense]]'s Early User Survey evaluations, flying 26 hours and surpassing all the JCA program requirements. The team also announced that if the C-27J is selected for the JCA, a production and final assembly facility would be built at Cecil Field, [[Duval_County|Duval County]], Florida. Final selection of the JCA is expected to be announced in March, 2007.

As of January, 2007, the C-27J was being considered as a sole-source contract by the Government of Canada as a future replacement for its current search and rescue airfleet, the contract being worth approximately $3-billion CDN.
