'''自由寫作'''（{{lang-en|Free writing}}），一種[[寫作|寫作]]的[[構思|構思]][[技巧|技巧]]。一個人連續書寫一段文字，而不在乎拼字、文法或者主題，就稱之為自由寫作。通常不夠完美，也不是實用的材料，但幫助作者克服冷漠與自我批評的障礙。主要被一些[[散文|散文]]作家與老師使用。有些[[作者|作者]]應用這個技巧收集最初的想法，和主題相關的概念，通常是正式寫作的準備。自由寫作和[[自動寫作|自動寫作]]（Automatic writing）不同。

不像[[腦力激盪法|腦力激盪]]一樣只是單純列出想法，在自由寫作中寫的是一個句子、甚至是一個段落，以陳述想法。

==歷史==
<!--[[Peter_Elbow|Peter Elbow]] advanced freewriting in his book, ''Writing Without Teachers'' (1975), and it has been popularized by [[Julia_Cameron|Julia Cameron]] through her book, ''The Artist's Way'' (1992). 

[[Natalie_Goldberg|Natalie Goldberg]] combined the notion of freewriting with Zen Buddhist meditation principles to develop ''writing practice'', described in books such as ''Writing Down the Bones'' (1986). Writing practice is different from freewriting encouraged in undergraduate and creative writing programs. Writing practice encourages the writer to be aware of their thoughts throughout the writing practice, and may be an ends unto itself, rather than a means to produce a more polished piece.-->
==技巧==
這個技巧牽涉到連續書寫，通常寫一段事先預定好的時間長度（通常是5、10或15分鐘）。作者不管拼字、文法，也不修改，就是寫。如果作者寫到一半覺得想不到什麼可以寫了，就寫「我想不到什麼可以寫」，直到出現下一個想法為止。作者不用管主題，只讓思維自然流過。
有時候，作者也可以設定自由書寫的主題，以選定的主題來組織想法。從這個主題向外擴展，想法可能脫離原本的主題，出現更形而上的想法。這個技巧可幫助作者在正式寫作前，更深入發掘主題。
自由寫作經常是作者的每日例行功課。寫作課程的教授也經常要求學生每天做這個練習。
<!--The technique involves continuous writing, usually for a predetermined period of time (often five, ten, or fifteen minutes). The writer writes without regard to spelling, grammar, etc., and makes no corrections. If the writer reaches a point where they can't think of anything to write, they write that they can't think of anything, until they find another line of thought. The writer freely strays off topic, letting thoughts lead where they may. At times, a writer may also do a focused freewrite, letting a chosen topic structure their thoughts. Expanding from this topic, the thoughts may stray to make connections and create more abstract views on the topic. This technique helps a writer explore a particular subject before putting ideas into a more basic context.

Freewriting is often done on a daily basis as a part of the writer's daily routine. Also, students in many writing courses are assigned to do such daily writing exercises.-->

==定義==
自由寫作基於一種假設，當每個人都有話想說且可以說出口時，心靈可能會被冷漠、自我批評、憤慨、截稿日的焦慮、失敗與責備的害怕或其他形式而阻礙。接受自由寫作概念的作者可以有足夠的氣勢將重重難關化為助力，這個概念的輪廓由一些寫作老師例如[[路易·丹拉普|路易·丹拉普]]、[[彼得、艾保|彼得、艾保]]與[[娜塔莉·戈德堡|娜塔莉·戈德堡]]構築而成<ref name="Cole2001">{{cite journal

==規則==
以下列出供初學者或學生參考的自由寫作技巧，出自Natalie Goldberg的《Rules for Free Writing》。

*設定時間，寫1、10或20分鐘，然後停止。
*在時間停止前，手要一直保持書寫。不要停頓，不要盯著空白，不要回頭讀前面寫出的東西。儘量寫快，但也不要寫太急。
*不要管文法、拼字、停頓、美觀、風格。沒有人會看到你寫了什麼。你寫出的正確性和品質並不重要，重要的是你在寫。
*如果你在寫時覺得無聊或不舒服，問自己是什麼在干擾你，然後寫下來。
*時間到了之後，看一遍你寫了什麼，其中可能包含一些寫作點子，把它標出來。這些點子可以在下一次自由寫作時繼續發展。

*Give yourself a time limit. Write for one or ten or twenty minutes, and then stop.
*Keep your hand moving until the time is up. Do not pause to stare into space or to read what you've written. Write quickly but not in a hurry.
*Pay no attention to grammar, spelling, punctuation, neatness, or style. Nobody else needs to read what you produce here. The correctness and quality of what you write do not matter; the act of writing does.
*If you get off the topic or run out of ideas, keep writing anyway. If necessary, write nonsense or whatever comes into your head, or simply scribble: anything to keep the hand moving.
*If you feel bored or uncomfortable as you're writing, ask yourself what's bothering you and write about that. 
*When the time is up, look over what you've written, and mark passages that contain ideas or phrases that might be worth keeping or elaborating on in a subsequent free-writing session.-->
