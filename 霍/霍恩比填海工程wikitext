'''霍恩比填海工程'''（Hornby Vellard）是一个[[土木工程|土木工程]]项目，旨在将[[孟买七岛|孟买七岛]]变成拥有深水天然海港的单个岛屿。工程由总督[[威廉·霍恩比|威廉·霍恩比]]开始于1708年， 直到1838年所有岛屿被连为整体。 

1784年完成了第一个重要工程项目，<!-- transformed 最初的孟买七岛into one landmass. Work on the Vellard was started in 1782 by 威廉·霍恩比, then [[孟买|孟买]]总督, against the wishes of the directors of [[英国东印度公司|英国东印度公司]]。 

The purpose of this vellard was to block the Worli creek and prevent the low-lying areas of Bombay from being flooded at high tide. The cost was estimated at about Rs. 100,000. --> 

<!-- == Legends ==
The story goes that Hornby ordered the work to be started after 东印度公司 turned down his proposal; and continued as Governor till the end of his term in [[1784|1784]], ignoring the suspension notice sent to him. 

Another story connected to the construction of the vellard is about the origin of the [[Mahalakshmi_temple|Mahalakshmi temple]]. Apparently after portions of the wall collapsed twice, the chief engineer, a [[Pathare_prabhu|Pathare prabhu]], dreamt of a [[Lakshmi|Lakshmi]] statue in the sea near [[Worli|Worli]]. He recovered it and built a temple for it, upon which the work on the vellard could be completed without a hitch. -->
