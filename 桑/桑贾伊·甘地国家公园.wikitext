== Kanheri 石窟 ==
[[Kanheri_石窟|Kanheri 石窟]]是一个受保护的考古遗址，由[[佛教|佛教]]徒所雕刻。<!-- The area was actually a settlement and once served as inns for travellers. The word Kanheri comes from the [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] word ''Krishnagiri'' which means '''黑山'''. -->

== 地理 ==
[[File:KNP-Bombay.jpg|thumb]]
该公园位于孟买郊区，占有北郊的大部分，<!-- 西面有几个镇[[Goregaon|Goregaon]], [[Malad|Malad]], [[Kandivali|Kandivali]], [[Borivali|Borivali]] and [[Dahisar|Dahisar]]. 东面 lie the townships of [[Bhandup|Bhandup]] and [[Mulund|Mulund]]. 南面是[[Aarey_Milk_Colony|Aarey Milk Colony]]。北面延伸到[[塔那|塔那]]县的森林。 -->
该区域地形起伏，海拔最高400 m。公园内有2个湖<!-- ：[[Vihar_Lake|Vihar Lake]]和[[Tulsi_Lake|Tulsi Lake]], -->供应该市部分饮用水。该公园由于净化全市大部分污染被称为孟买的肺脏。

== 生物多样性 ==
<!-- The park is a bustling forest. An estimated 800 types of flowering plants; 284 kinds of birds; 5,000 species of insects; 36 types of mammals; 50 reptiles and 150 species of [[蝴蝶|蝴蝶]] (which are 2.5 times the number found in the [[英国|英国]]) call the forest their home.

The park has also many endangered species of plant and animal. The world's largest [[moth|moth]], the [[Atlas_moth|Atlas moth]], was discovered here. [[Karvi|Karvi]], a flowering plant, blooms once in 7 years, carpeting the slopes with a shade of mauve. The park is also home to a small population of leopards.

In 2003, pug marks and droppings of a [[tiger|tiger]] were found in this region. Although the tiger was never spotted, it did bring some excitement to city folks as the last tiger was shot down 80 years earlier. -->

公园的一小部分向公众开放，并建立了一个迷你[[动物园|动物园]]，使得游客能在远处观看这些动物。<!-- A safari also guides and educates visitors on the natural habitats of these animals. A toy train travels around the tourist zone showcasing parts of the rich biodiversity. Many visitors do also travel to the Kanheri Caves, especially on an auspicious day in August. Nature trails and treks are also popular with some leading you to the ''Highest Point'' trail, the highest point in the city, to take a panoramic view of the city. -->


<!-- Collection at the gates in November 2004 touched Rs 98 [[lakh|lakh]] (9.8 [[million|million]] [[Indian_rupee|rupees]]). Other recreation spots include a boating facility in the recreation zone of Krishnagiri in [[Borivali|Borivali]].

Rock climbing enthusiasts have been coming to national park for quite some time now. There are many rock faces littered all around national park and kanehri caves that offers a great opportunity for rock climbers. -->
<!-- ==Vanrani==

The Park also featured a toy train that runs on a [[narrow_gauge|narrow gauge]] rail line. The toy train ''Vanrani'', which means Jungle Queen, ran for around twenty-five years before it was discontinued in 2001 because of the pathetic condition of the track. The circuitous route covers a 2.5 [[kilometre|kilometre]] long distance parallel to the road leading to the [[Kanheri_Caves|Kanheri Caves]]. However in 2004, fresh bids were announced for the repair of the track, which was estimated to cost around Rs 30 lakh (3 million). Tickets would be priced at Rs 10 for adults and 5 for children.


In the month of march the tracks were repaired. The train has started to run again after a gap of nearly 2 yrs.The price of the tickets however remain the same. Most of the animals in the zoo have either been moved or have died hence there is nothing much to see during the train ride except the overwhelming greenery.

There is also One another such a small train travel experience near mumbai. This is the [[Narrow_gauge|Narrow gauge]] train to travel from Neral to Matheraan. Matheraan is a very beautiful HIll station near mumbai just an hours travel from mumbai. -->
<!-- ==Taramati Temple==
Taramati Temple is on the top of the mountain towards Mulund. This temple was demolished by the forest department some years ago but Mulund locals with vested interest are trying to reconstruct the temple. Once the temple is complete some Religious leaders will arrive and settle down gradually. -->
== 问题 ==
这个公园面临许多与世界上其他国家公园类似的问题，包括自然与人类兴趣之间的冲突。 

在1970年代初，提议修建一条穿过公园的公路。自然主义者[[Humayun_Abdulali|Humayun Abdulali]]向法庭起诉，停止了这个项目。 

由于孟买的空间的缺乏，迫使居民区日益逼近公园边界。公园边界只有简单的篱笆，常有野兽闯入人类的住所。迅速增加的贫民窟已经包围了公园。当地政客的腐败<!--  and Mumbai's influential builder lobby are commonly seen as responsible for a perceived shrinking of the park.

June 2004, [[leopard|leopard]]s were responsible for the deaths of 20 humans within the span of a week. This was not the first attack. For the past 10 years there have been attacks attributed to leopards stalking children and adults outside the park fringes. After an outcry was raised and the situation reached alarming proportions, eight leopards were caught and relocated. -->
