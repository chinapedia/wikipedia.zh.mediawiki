在[[板球|板球]]运动中，'''三柱门'''（wicket）可以有多种独特的含义。

首先，三柱门是位于方球场两端的两套三根木柱和两根横木组合之一。为防止球击中三柱门，三柱门由击球手使用球板保护。三柱门的尺寸略图参见板球规则的附录一[https://web.archive.org/web/20080808140939/http://www.lords.org/cricket/lw_0000000074.asp]。

三柱门最早是利用了wicket的标准定义——小门。而在历史上，三柱门的确曾象门一样，只有两个门柱和一根横木。
<!--
Set of stumps
A wicket consists of three stumps, upright wooden poles that are hammered into the ground, topped with two wooden crosspieces, known as the bails.

Primarily, the wicket is one of the two sets of 3 stumps and 2 bails at either end of the pitch. The wicket is guarded by a batsman who, with his bat, attempts to prevent the ball from hitting the wicket. A diagram demonstrating the measurements of a wicket can be found in Appendix A of the Laws of cricket [1].

The origin of the word is from the standard definition of wicket as a small gate. Historically, cricket wickets had only two stumps and one bail and looked like a gate.

<!--Dismissing a batsman

A wicket is the event of a batsman getting out. The batsman is said to have lost his wicket. If dismissed by a bowler, the bowler is said to have taken his wicket. The number of wickets taken is the primary measure of a bowler's ability.

For a batsman to be dismissed by being bowled, run out, stumped or hit wicket his wicket needs to be put down. What this means is defined by Law 28 of the Laws of cricket. The wicket is put down if a bail is completely removed from the top of the stumps, or a stump is struck out of the ground by the ball, the striker's bat, the striker's person (or by any part of his clothing or equipment becoming detached from his person), a fielder (with his hand or arm) and providing that the ball is held in the hand or hands so used, or in the hand of the arm so used. The wicket is also put down if a fielder pulls a stump out of the ground in the same manner.-->
三柱门可以指击球手出局这种情况。可以说击球手失去了他的三柱门。如果因[[投球手_(板球)|投球手]]而出局，则可以说投球手取得了他的三柱门。取得三柱门的多少是衡量投球手能力的主要方面。

对击球手来说，被击杀、截杀、持球撞柱或误击三柱门而出局，應是因為他的三柱門被放倒。如同板球规则第38条所规定。三柱门被放倒是指一根横木完全从门柱之上或一个门柱从地上，被球、击球员的球板、击球员自身（或由其自身分离而出的衣物或球具的任何部分）、防守队员（使用其手或手臂）在该手或手臂持有球的情况下，移开或击起。门柱被防守队员以相同的方式拔出同样是三柱门被放倒。
<!--If one bail is off, removing the remaining bail or striking or pulling any of the three stumps out of the ground is sufficient to put the wicket down. A fielder may remake the wicket, if necessary, in order to put it down to have an opportunity of running out a batsman.

If the umpires have agreed to dispense with bails, because, for example, it is too windy for the bails to remain on the stumps, the decision as to whether the wicket has been put down is one for the umpire concerned to decide. After a decision to play without bails, the wicket has been put down if the umpire concerned is satisfied that the wicket has been struck by the ball, by the striker's bat, person, or items of his clothing or equipment separated from his person as described above, or by a fielder with the hand holding the ball or with the arm of the hand holding the ball.

如果仅有一根横木，则移去此横木或从地面击起或拔出三根门柱中的任意一根都可算作放倒三柱门。如果以截杀方式使击球手出局，在需要的情况下防守队员可以重搭三柱门。

如果裁判同意省去横木，比如因为风太大而横木不容易搭在门柱上的情况，如何算作三柱门被放倒则需要裁判考虑判定。在决定不使用横木之后，三柱门被放倒的情况应满足裁判对三柱门被球、击球员的球板、击球员自身，或由其自身分离而出的上述任何部分、使用其手或手臂的防守队员在该手或手臂持有球的情况下，击中或击起的判定。

=== 搭档 ===
<!--Partnership

The sequence of time over which two particular batsmen bat together, a partnership, is referred to as a specifically numbered wicket when discriminating it from other partnerships in the innings.

    * The first wicket partnership is from the start of the innings until the first batsman gets out.
    * The second wicket partnership is from when the first batsman gets out until the second batsman gets out.
    * etc...
    * The tenth wicket or last wicket partnership is from when the ninth batsman gets out until the tenth batsman gets out.
-->
两位击球手作为搭档在场上击球的时间次序，可以按照排号的三柱门来和同一局中其它搭档以示区分，如：
*第一对三柱门搭档是从此局开始至第一位击球手出局。
*第二对三柱门搭档是从第一位击球手出局开始至第二位击球手出局。
*……
*第十对或最后一对三柱门搭档是从第九位击球手出局开始至第十位击球手出局。

=== 获胜成绩 ===
<!--Winning by number of wickets

A team can win a match by a certain number of wickets. This means that they were batting last, and reached the winning target with a certain number of batsmen still not dismissed. A team's innings ends when ten batsmen are dismissed, so, for example, if the side scored the required number of runs to win with only three batsmen dismissed, they are said to have won by seven wickets.
-->
某队可以以n个三柱门的成绩获胜。即此队最后击球，并且在达到获胜目标比分的时候仍有n个击球手尚未出局。每队十名击球手出局，则此队的击球局结束，所以，如果某队在获得取胜所需的得分跑数目之后只有三名击球手出局，则可以说他们以7个三柱门的成绩获胜。

=== 方球场 ===
<!--The pitch

The word wicket is also sometimes used to refer to the cricket pitch itself. According to the Laws of Cricket, this usage is incorrect, but it is in common usage and commonly understood by cricket followers. This usage probably derives from the days when the outfield was kept short by grazing sheep on it and the playing surface, which was specially prepared, was protected from them by a light wicker fence around it. Since many regular grounds had resident bat-makers it is quite possible that the branches cut off from the willow wood used for the bats formed all or part of this fence. Much willow is employed in making wicker-work.

The term sticky wicket comes from a situation in which rain has dampened the pitch. This makes the path of the ball more unpredictable thus making the job of defending the stumps that much more difficult.

三柱门一词在某些情况下也可以指板球方球场（球道）本身。虽然根据板球规则，这种用法并不正确，但对于板球爱好者来说则相当普遍。这种用法可能源于早期板球场外场是由牧羊啃食来保持草坪平整，而方球场则需要特殊预备，所以用轻柳条制的围栏保护起来。由于多数正规场地附近就有当地球板制造商，那些用于制造球板的柳木所砍下的树枝边角很有可能就成了这种围栏的原材料。

Sticky wicket一词则是指因为雨后方球场变潮，反弹后的球路很难预测，从而使保护门柱的任务变得很难。

=== 方球场一端 ===
<!--One end of the pitch

A wicket can also refer to the general area around the stumps, particularly the safe area behind the batsman's crease. This is seen in usage such as The batsmen ran between the wickets, which does not necessarily imply they were close to the actual stumps at the beginning or end of the run.
-->
三柱门也可以指围绕门柱的一定区域，特指击球手区域线之后的安全区。因此三柱门在“击球手于三柱门之间得分跑”中的用法，就并不意味着他们在得分跑开始或结束时紧挨着门柱。
