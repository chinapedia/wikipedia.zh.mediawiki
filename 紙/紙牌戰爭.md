《'''紙牌戰爭'''》（{{lang-en|'''Card Wars'''}}）是《[[探險活寶|探險活寶]]》[[探險活寶_(第四季)|第四季]]第十四集的名稱。在[[卡通頻道|卡通頻道]]2012年7月16日播出。本集以[[小男孩阿寶|小男孩阿寶]]和魔法狗[[酷狗老皮|老皮]]為主角。在這一集裡，阿寶和傑克玩[[桌上遊戲|桌上遊戲]]紙牌戰爭。但事局變糟時，傑克變得好勝。

<!--==劇情==
Jake explains to Finn that his girlfriend, Lady Rainicorn will not play his favorite card game, ‘’Card Wars’’; Finn, however, agrees to play with Jake, and the duo agree that the winner will be rewarded with [[Soft_drink|soda]], whereas the loser will be forced to drink a terrible concoction including soda, [[coffee_grounds|coffee grounds]], and [[kimchi|kimchi]], among other things. With the stakes set, the game begins.

Jake explains the complex and arcane rules to Finn, who quickly falls asleep. However, once the game beings, Finn gains the upper hand, largely by “flooping” (or “activating”) his Pig card. Time and time again, Jake tries to kill Finn’s Pig, only for his plans to backfire. Soon, however, Jake becomes angry and aggressive, and Finn is warned by BMO (voiced by [[Niki_Yang|Niki Yang]]) that if Jake loses, he will become bitter and depressed. Finn, therefore, decides to purposely lose the game for Jake’s sake.

Once the game resumes, Finn purposely sacrifices his all-powerful Pig, allowing Jake to defeat him. Finn is forced to drink the disgusting liquid concoction, but manages to trick Jake into trying it. The episode ends with the two brothers happily sharing the nasty drink, seemingly friends again.

==Production==
"Card Wars" was written and storyboarded by Bert Youn and Somvilay Xayaphone, from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]]. The episode was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Card Wars| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Somvilay Xayaphone & Bert Youn (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=July 16, 2012| season = 4 | number = 14}}</ref> During the middle of the episode, both Finn and Jake are depicted with grotesque, [[off-model|off-model]] faces, a trademark of Youn's storyboarding style. These faces necessitated lead character designer [[Andy_Ristaino|Andy Ristaino]] to drew several unique, key frames, colloquially known as "Bert Youn Specials".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ristaino|first1=Andy|title=[Andy Ristaino explaining a 'Bert Youn Special']|url=http://new.spring.me/#!/skronked/q/241954725665181209|publisher=[[Spring.me|Spring.me]]|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}</ref> Ristaino revealed that he drew at least three of these faces for the episode.<ref name=andycard>Ristaino, Andy (Storyboard artist). 2014.

Storyboard artist [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]] noted that the idea behind this episode had been in development for a long time.<ref name=sugarcard/> Originally, it had been planned to make the episode during the first season because McHale and Ward were actively playing immersive, [[worldbuilding|worldbuilding]] games.<ref name=wardcard/> However, it took until the fourth season for the episode to be made.<ref name=sugarcard>Sugar, Rebecca (Storyboard artist). 2014.

Alasdair Wilkins of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode an "A–" and wrote that, on the surface, the episode "has got to be an instant contender for the most low-key ''Adventure Time'' ever", noting that there are no guest stars and that the action is centered entirely in Finn and Jake's Tree Fort.<ref name=avclub/> However, he applauded the episode, arguing that it "absolutely nails the insanity of trying to jump into an overcomplicated, impenetrable game with a much more seasoned competitor".<ref name=avclub/> Wilkins compared the titular Card Wars game to ''[[Magic:_The_Gathering|Magic: The Gathering]]'', ''[[Dungeons_&_Dragons|Dungeons & Dragons]]'', and ''[[Risk_(game)|Risk]]'', pointing out that ''Card Wars''{{'}} "byzantine rules and gleefully baffling terminology" emulates and lampoons the aforementioned games.<ref name=avclub/> Ultimately, Wilkins concluded that the episode was successful because of "how real this all feels".<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|last1=Wilkins|first1=Alasdair|title=Adventure Time: 'Card Wars'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-card-wars-82412|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

Tyler Foster of [[DVD_Talk|DVD Talk]] named the episode as one of the "highlights" of the ''Fionna and Cake'' DVD, witing, "As the show often feels like a big riff on Dungeons and Dragons, this spoof of tabletop gaming is full of absurd yet deeply familiar moments: the endless rule-reading, the surprise triumphs, and the seething rage."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Foster|first1=Tyler|title='Adventure Time': Fionna and Cake|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/58738/adventure-time-fionna-cake-4/|website=[[DVD_Talk|DVD Talk]]|publisher=[[Internet_Brands|Internet Brands]]|accessdate=August 24, 2014|date=February 19, 2013}}</ref>
