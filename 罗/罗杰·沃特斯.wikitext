|姓名=罗杰·沃特斯<br/>Roger Waters}}
'''乔治·罗杰·沃特斯'''（{{lang-en|'''George Roger Waters'''}}；{{bd|1943年|9月6日}}）是一个英国词曲作者、歌手、贝斯手和作曲家。1965年他与鼓手[[尼克·马森|尼克·梅森]]、键盘手[[理查德·赖特_(音乐家)|理查德·赖特]]和兼任吉他手、歌手和词曲作者的[[西德·巴雷特|西德·巴雷特]]共同组成了[[前卫摇滚|前卫摇滚]]乐队[[平克·弗洛伊德|平克·弗洛伊德]]。沃特斯最初担任贝斯手，但1968年西德·巴雷特离开后，沃特斯也成为了他们的作词者、共同主唱和概念领袖。

平克·弗洛伊德凭借[[概念专辑|概念专辑]]《[[月之暗面|月之暗面]]》、《[[愿你在此|愿你在此]]》、《动物》和《[[迷墙|迷墙]]》获得了国际性成功。到20世纪80年代初，他们已经成为流行音乐中最受好评和商业成功的团体之一；到2013年，他们已经在全世界取得了超过2.5亿的专辑销量。由于乐队成员之间创作理念的差异，沃特斯于1985年离开乐队并与其余乐队成员在歌曲版权和乐队名称的使用权产生了纠纷。纠纷于1987年以个人形式解决。

沃特斯的个人作品包括录音室专辑《{{link-en|搭便车的利与弊|The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking}}》（1984年）、《{{link-en|Radio K.A.O.S.}}》（1987年）、《欢愉至死》（1992年）和《这是我们真正想要的生活吗？》（2017年）。在2005年，他发行了一部[[歌剧|歌剧]]，翻译自{{link-en|埃蒂安·罗达-吉尔|Étienne Roda-Gil}}和纳丁·罗达-吉尔（Nadine Roda-Gil）关于[[法国大革命|法国大革命]]的[[歌剧剧本|歌剧剧本]]。

在1990年，沃特斯举办了历史上规模最大的摇滚音乐会之一的《迷墙 - 柏林现场》，演出参加人数达45万人。作为平克·弗洛伊德的成员之一，他分别在1996年和2005年被选入美国[[摇滚名人堂|摇滚名人堂]]和英国音乐名人堂。2005年晚些时候，他与平克·弗洛伊德成员梅森、赖特和吉尔摩在[[现场八方|现场八方]]全球意识活动中重新团聚，这是自1981年以来乐队首次和沃特斯一起出现。1999年以来，他进行了广泛的单人表演；他在2006-2008世界巡演中完整地演出了《月之暗面》，并在2010年开始了迷墙现场巡演，这是史上最畅销的个人现场演出。

== 早年==
沃特斯1943年9月6日生于[[英国|英国]][[薩里郡|萨里郡]]大布克姆，是玛丽（née Whyte；1913–2009）和埃里克·弗莱彻·沃特斯（1914–1944）的第二个儿子。{{sfn|Thompson|2013|p=7}}他的父亲是[[煤矿|煤矿]]工人和[[工党_(英国)|工党]]活动家的儿子，是一名教师，一位虔诚的[[基督教|基督教]]徒和一名[[大不列颠共产党|共产党]]员。{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=13}}在[[第二次世界大战|第二次世界大战]]的早期，他的父亲是一名在[[闪电战|闪电战]]期间驾驶救护车的[[良心拒服兵役者|良心拒服兵役者]]。{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=13}}

沃特斯的父亲后来改变了他的和平主义立场，参加了[[英國陸軍預備役部隊|英国陆军预备役部队]]并被委任到第8营，1943年9月11日在皇家燧发枪团担任一名少尉。<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36253|date=1943年11月16日|page=5071|supp=y}}</ref>他于5个月后的1944年1月18日在鹅卵石行动期间于[[阿普里利亞|阿普里利亚]]被杀，罗格斯此时五个月大。<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|pp=13–14}}</ref>他安葬在卡西诺战争公墓，作为纪念。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2099066/WATERS,%20ERIC%20FLETCHER|title=WATERS, ERIC FLETCHER|accessdate=2013年3月1日|author=|date=|publisher=Commonwealth War Graves Commission}}</ref>2014年2月18日，沃特斯公布了他父亲和阿普利亚里的其他战争伤亡者的纪念碑，并成为[[安濟奧|安济奥]]的荣誉公民。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wantedinrome.com/news/roger-waters-made-honorary-citizen-of-anzio/|title=Wanted in Rome|accessdate=|author=|date=2014年1月18日|publisher=}}</ref>

在丈夫去世后，亦是一位老师的玛丽·沃特斯带着两个儿子前往剑桥，并将他们抚养在那里。{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp=5–6}}罗杰·沃特斯最早的记忆是[[第二次世界大战对日战争胜利纪念日|第二次世界大战对日战争胜利纪念日]]。<ref name="DID">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011j39v|title=Desert Island Discs, Roger Waters|accessdate=2011年5月29日|author=|date=2011年5月29日|publisher=BBC Radio 4}}</ref>

沃特斯参加了莫利纪念小学并在之后和[[西德·巴雷特|西德·巴雷特]]在剑桥男子高中学习，而他未来的音乐搭档大卫·吉尔摩住在该市的米尔路附近，并且在佩斯学校就读。{{sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|pp=15–18}}在15岁时，沃特斯担任剑桥[[核裁军运动|核裁军]]青年[[核裁军运动|运动]]（YCND）的主席，{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 12–13}}设计了其宣传海报并参与了其组织。{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=13}}

虽然他是一个热衷运动的人，也是高中板球和橄榄球队的一个备受推崇的队员，{{sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|1991|p=23}}但他不喜欢他的教育经历; 根据沃特斯的说法，“除了游戏之外，我讨厌在其中每一秒钟。学校的政权是一个压迫人的政权。那些容易受到其他孩子欺负的的孩子同样也容易受到老师的欺凌。”{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 14–19}}沃特斯在童年时在剑桥认识巴雷特和吉尔莫，在伦敦[[攝政街理工學院|摄政理工学院]]（之后的[[威斯敏斯特大學|威斯敏斯特大学]]）建筑系遇见了未来平克·弗洛伊德创团成员[[尼克·马森|尼克·梅森]]和[[理查德·赖特_(音乐家)|理查德·赖特]]。沃特斯于1962年就读于此，经过一系列适应性测试表明他非常适合该领域。{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=320}}他最初考虑过[[机械工程|机械工程]]的职业。{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=36}}

到1963年9月，沃特斯和梅森对他们的学习失去了兴趣并搬到了摄政街理工学院兼职导师迈克·伦纳德拥有的斯坦霍普花园的低层公寓。<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=40}}：（第二手来源）； {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=20}}：（第一手来源）</ref>沃特斯、梅森和赖特于1963年底首次在主唱基斯诺布尔和贝司手克莱夫·梅特卡夫组成的乐队中一起演奏音乐。<ref>{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=13}}：（第二手来源）； {{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=17}}（第一手来源）</ref>

他们通常称自己为西格玛6（Sigma 6），但也使用过the Meggadeaths这个名字。{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=13}}沃特斯和梅森分别演奏节奏吉他和鼓，赖特在他可以安排使用的任何键盘上演奏，而诺布尔的姐姐希拉格偶尔提供声乐伴奏。{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=17–18}}早年，乐队在私人演出时表演，并在摄政街理工学院地下室的一个[[茶室|茶室]]里排练。{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=13–18}}

在1963年9月，当梅特卡夫和诺布尔离开自建组合时，剩余的乐队成员要求[[西德·巴雷特|巴雷特]]和吉他手鲍勃·克罗斯加入。<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|p=18}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=14}}: (secondary source).</ref>沃特斯转为演奏贝斯并且在1964年1月，乐队开始被称为the Abdabs（或者叫the Screaming Abdabs）。{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}}在1964年后期乐队还使用了伦纳德的寄宿者（Leonard's Lodgers）、频谱五（Spectrum Five）、最终（and eventually）、茶具（the Tea Set）四个名称。{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 18, 28}}在1965年末的某个时候，茶具开始自称为平克·弗洛伊德声音（Pink Floyd Sound），后来改称为平克·弗洛伊德蓝调（Pink Floyd Blues），直到1966年初称为平克·弗洛伊德。<ref>{{harvnb|Mason|2005|pp=30–37}}：（第一手来源）； {{harvnb|Povey|2008|p=32}}：（第二手来源）。</ref>

到1966年初，巴雷特成为平克弗洛伊德的领头人、吉他手和词曲作者。{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=87}}他写了或合作写了除了一首曲目以外的他们的第一张LP唱片《[[黎明门前的风笛手|黎明门前的风笛手]]》，专辑在1967年8月发行。{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 87–107}}沃特斯为这张专辑贡献了歌曲《[[黎明门前的风笛手|黎明门前的风笛手]]》。{{sfn|Blake|2008|p= 91}}到1967年末，巴雷特心理健康状况日益恶化，行为越来越不稳定{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=90–114}}，使他“无法或不愿意”{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=129}}继续担任平克·弗洛伊德的主创歌手和主音吉他手的身份。{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=87–107}}在1968年3月，

平克·弗洛伊德会见了经理人皮特·詹那和布莱克希尔企业的安德鲁·金洽谈乐队的未来。巴雷特同意离开平克·弗洛伊德，并且乐队“同意布莱克希尔的永久授权”对“过去活动”。{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=105}}乐队的新经理人{{link-en|史蒂夫·奥洛克|Steve O'Rourke}}制作了一份关于巴雷特离队和1968年4月大卫·吉尔摩的入队的正式声明。{{sfn|Mason|2005|p=106}}

为了填补巴雷特离开所产生的领导空白，1968年3月，沃特斯开始主导平克·弗洛伊德的艺术创作方向。他成为了主要的作曲者、作词者以及联合主唱（与吉尔摩一起，有时与赖特），并且在其1985年离开之前一直作为乐队的首要创作者。{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 106–107, 160–161, 265, 278}}从《[[月之暗面|月之暗面]]》 (1973) 到《[[最终乐章|最终乐章]]》(1983)，在沃特斯离开乐队之前，他为平克·弗洛伊德的五张专辑担任作曲，与此同时，他在创作上对乐队和其音乐的逐步发挥更重要的作用。从 《[[月之暗面|月之暗面]]》起，每张沃特斯经手的录音室专辑都是[[概念专辑|概念专辑]]。{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 3, 9, 113, 156, 242, 279, 320, 398}}完全由沃特斯作词的专辑《[[月之暗面|月之暗面]]》是有史以来在商业最成功的摇滚专辑之一。它达到了公告牌二百强专辑榜的第一名并持续了一周，并在1973年到1988年在排行榜上停留了741周，在全球共卖出了超4000万份。截至2005年，该专辑仍然持续每周卖出超8000份。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58524/floyds-dark-side-celebrates-chart-milestone|title=Floyd's 'Dark Side' Celebrates Chart Milestone|last1=Titus|first1=Christa|last2=Waddell|first2=Ray|work=[[Billboard_(magazine)|Billboard]]|year=2005|accessdate=24 October 2011|archive-date=2013-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130330033818/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/58524/floyds-dark-side-celebrates-chart-milestone|dead-url=no}}</ref>根据平克·弗洛伊德的传记作者Glen Povey的描述，《[[月之暗面|月之暗面]]》是世界上第二畅销的专辑，也是美国21世纪最畅销的专辑{{sfn|Povey|2008|p= 345}}

Waters produced thematic ideas that became the impetus for the Pink Floyd concept albums ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' (1973), ''[[Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975), ''[[Animals_(Pink_Floyd_album)|Animals]]'' (1977) and ''[[The_Wall|The Wall]]'' (1979)—written largely by Waters—and ''[[The_Final_Cut_(album)|The Final Cut]]'' (1983)—written entirely by Waters.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 265–269}} He referred or alluded to the cost of war and the loss of his father throughout his work, from "[[Corporal_Clegg|Corporal Clegg]]" (''[[A_Saucerful_of_Secrets|A Saucerful of Secrets]]'', 1968) and "[[Free_Four|Free Four]]" (''[[Obscured_by_Clouds|Obscured by Clouds]]'', 1972) to "[[Us_and_Them_(song)|Us and Them]]" from ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', "[[When_the_Tigers_Broke_Free|When the Tigers Broke Free]]", first used in the feature film, ''[[Pink_Floyd_–_The_Wall|The Wall]]'' (1982), later included with "[[The_Fletcher_Memorial_Home|The Fletcher Memorial Home]]" on ''The Final Cut'', an album dedicated to his father.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=294}} The theme and composition of ''The Wall'' was influenced by his upbringing in an English society depleted of men after the [[Second_World_War|Second World War]].{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 294–295, 351}}

The double album ''The Wall'' was written almost entirely by Waters and is largely based on his life story.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p= 260}} Having sold over 23 million [[RIAA_certification|RIAA certified units]] in the US as of 2013, is one of the top three best-selling albums of all time in America, according to RIAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |title=RIAA GOLD & PLATINUM Top 100 Albums |accessdate=17 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqv3Gpco?url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |archivedate=17 January 2010  }}</ref> Pink Floyd hired [[Bob_Ezrin|Bob Ezrin]] to co-produce the album and cartoonist [[Gerald_Scarfe|Gerald Scarfe]] to illustrate the sleeve art.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp=260–261}} The band embarked on [[The_Wall_Tour_(1980–81)|The Wall Tour]] of Los Angeles, New York, London, and Dortmund. The last band performance of ''The Wall'' was on 16 June 1981, at Earls Court London, and this was Pink Floyd's last appearance with Waters until the band's brief reunion at 2 July 2005 Live 8 concert in London's Hyde Park, 24 years later.{{sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|p= 185}}

In March 1983, the last Waters–Gilmour–Mason collaboration, ''The Final Cut'', was released. The album was subtitled: "A requiem for the post-war dream by Roger Waters, performed by Pink Floyd".{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=230}} Waters wrote all the album's lyrics as well as the music. His lyrics were critical of the [[Conservative_Party_(UK)|Conservative Party]] government of the day and mention Prime Minister [[Margaret_Thatcher|Margaret Thatcher]] by name.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 294–299}} At the time Gilmour did not have any new material, so he asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p= 295}} According to Mason, after power struggles within the band and creative arguments about the album, Gilmour's name "disappeared" from the production credits, though he retained his pay.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp= 264–270}} ''Rolling Stone'' magazine gave the album five stars, with [[Kurt_Loder|Kurt Loder]] describing it as "a superlative achievement" and "art rock's crowning masterpiece".<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=300}}: "art rock's crowning masterpiece"; {{harvnb|Schaffner|1991|p=262}}: "a superlative achievement".</ref> Loder viewed the work as "essentially a Roger Waters solo album".<ref>{{cite web |last=Loder |first=Kurt |title=Pink Floyd: The Final Cut (Toshiba) |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-final-cut-19830414 |work=Rolling Stone |date=14 April 1983 |accessdate=6 May 2012 |archive-date=2008-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622041133/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/pinkfloyd/albums/album/107472/review/5943392/the_final_cut |dead-url=no }}</ref>

===离开和对吉尔摩和梅森的诉讼===
Amidst creative differences, Waters left Pink Floyd in 1985 and began a legal battle with the band regarding their continued use of the name and material.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241}} In December 1985, Waters issued a statement to EMI and CBS invoking the "Leaving Member" clause in his contract. In October 1986, he initiated [[High_Court_of_Justice|High Court]] proceedings to formally dissolve the Pink Floyd partnership. In his submission to the High Court he called Pink Floyd a "spent force creatively".{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=221, 237, 240–241, 246}} Gilmour and Mason opposed the application and announced their intention to continue as Pink Floyd. Waters claims to have been forced to resign much like Wright some years earlier, and decided to leave Pink Floyd based on legal considerations, stating: "if I hadn't, the financial repercussions would have wiped me out completely."{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 312–313}} In December 1987, Waters and Pink Floyd reached an agreement.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=240–241}} According to Mason:

{{quote|sign=|source=|We eventually formalised a settlement with Roger. On Christmas Eve, 1987 ... David and Roger convened for a summit meeting on the houseboat [the ''[[Astoria_(recording_studio)|Astoria]]''] with Jerome Walton, David's accountant. Jerome painstakingly typed out the bones of a settlement. Essentially—although there was far more complex detail—the arrangement allowed Roger to be freed from his arrangement with Steve [O'Rourke], and David and me to continue working under the name ''Pink Floyd''. In the end the court accepted Jerome's version as the final and binding document and duly stamped it.{{sfn|Mason|2005|pp=293–294}}}}

Waters was released from his contractual obligation with O'Rourke, and he retained the copyrights to the ''Wall'' concept and the inflatable ''Animals ''pig.{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp= 139}} Pink Floyd released three studio albums without him: ''[[A_Momentary_Lapse_of_Reason|A Momentary Lapse of Reason]]'' (1987), ''[[The_Division_Bell|The Division Bell]]'' (1994) and ''[[The_Endless_River|The Endless River]]'' (2014).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/roger-waters-reminds-curious-fans-i-am-not-part-of-pink-floyd-20141002|title=Roger Waters Reminds Fans: 'I Am Not Part of Pink Floyd'|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-04-01}}</ref> In 2005, Waters said of their almost twenty years of animosity: "I don't think any of us came out of the years from 1985 with any credit ... It was a bad, negative time, and I regret my part in that negativity."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=395}} In 2013, he said he regretted the lawsuit, saying:

{{Quote|text=I was wrong. Of course I was ... It's one of the few times that the legal profession has taught me something. Because when I went to these chaps and said, "Listen, we're broke, this isn't Pink Floyd anymore," they went, "What do you mean? That's irrelevant, it is a label and it has commercial value. You can't say it's going to cease to exist... you obviously don't understand English jurisprudence."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-24160584|title=Pink Floyd star Roger Waters regrets suing band|date=19 September 2013|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref> }}

Following the release of ''The Final Cut'', Waters embarked on a solo career. In 1984, he released his first solo album, ''[[The_Pros_and_Cons_of_Hitch_Hiking|The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'', a project about a man's dreams across one night that dealt with Waters' feelings about monogamy and family life versus "the call of the wild".{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273}} In the end the character, Reg, chooses love and matrimony over promiscuity. The album featured guitarist [[Eric_Clapton|Eric Clapton]], jazz saxophonist [[David_Sanborn|David Sanborn]], and artwork by Gerald Scarfe.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273}} Kurt Loder described ''The Pros And Cons of Hitch Hiking'' as a "strangely static, faintly hideous record".{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 305–306}} ''Rolling Stone'' rated the album a "rock bottom one star."{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|pp= 272–273}} Years later, Mike DeGagne of [[AllMusic|AllMusic]] praised the album for its, "ingenious symbolism" and "brilliant use of stream of consciousness within a subconscious realm", rating it four out of five stars.<ref>{{cite web|url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r21602|pure_url=yes}} |title= The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking |first= Mike|last= DeGagne|work= AllMusic |accessdate=17 October 2010 }}</ref>

Waters began touring in support of the album, aided by Clapton, a new band, new material, and a selection of Pink Floyd favourites.

In November 1989, the [[Berlin_Wall|Berlin Wall]] fell, and in July 1990 Waters staged one of the largest and most elaborate rock concerts in history,{{sfn|Povey|Russell|1997|pp=246–247}} ''[[The_Wall –_Live_in_Berlin|The Wall – Live in Berlin]]'', on the vacant terrain between [[Potsdamer_Platz|Potsdamer Platz]] and the [[Brandenburg_Gate|Brandenburg Gate]]. The show reported an official attendance of 200,000, though some estimates are as much as twice that, with approximately one billion television viewers.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=346}} [[Leonard_Cheshire|Leonard Cheshire]] asked him to do the concert to raise funds for charity.

Waters also used an East German symphony orchestra and choir, a Soviet marching band, and a pair of helicopters from the U.S. [[7th_Airborne_Command_and_Control_Squadron|7th Airborne Command and Control Squadron]]. Designed by Mark Fisher, the Wall was 25 metres tall and 170 metres long and was built across the set. Scarfe's inflatable puppets were recreated on an enlarged scale, and although many rock icons received invitations to the show, Gilmour, Mason, and Wright, did not.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 342–347}} Waters released a live double-album of the performance, which has been certified platinum by the RIAA.<ref name="RIAAGPC"/>

In 1990, Waters hired manager [[Mark_Fenwick|Mark Fenwick]] and left EMI for a worldwide deal with Columbia. He released his third studio album, ''[[Amused_to_Death|Amused to Death]]'', in 1992. The record is heavily influenced by the events of the [[Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] and the [[Gulf_War|Gulf War]], and a critique of the notion of war becoming the subject of entertainment, particularly on television. The title was derived from the book ''[[Amusing_Ourselves_to_Death|Amusing Ourselves to Death]]'' by [[Neil_Postman|Neil Postman]]. [[Patrick_Leonard|Patrick Leonard]], who worked on ''A Momentary Lapse of Reason'', co-produced the album. [[Jeff_Beck|Jeff Beck]] played lead guitar on many of the album's tracks, which were recorded with a cast of musicians at ten different recording studios.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 348–349}} It is Waters' most critically acclaimed solo recording, garnering comparison to his work with Pink Floyd.{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 347–352}} Waters described the record as, a "stunning piece of work", ranking the album with ''Dark Side of the Moon'' and ''The Wall'' as one of the best of his career.{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp= 141, 252}} The album had one hit, the song "[[What_God_Wants|What God Wants]], Pt. 1", which reached number 35 in the UK in September 1992 and number 5 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s [[Hot_Mainstream_Rock_Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart in the US.<ref name="RWAM">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=roger-waters-p5795/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Roger Waters: Billboard Singles |work= AllMusic|accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> ''Amused to Death'' was certified Silver by the [[British_Phonographic_Industry|British Phonographic Industry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx|title=BPI Certifications|publisher=[[British_Phonographic_Industry|British Phonographic Industry]]|accessdate=2 October 2010|archive-date=2013-02-06|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EEYfYVwc?url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx|dead-url=no}}</ref> Sales of ''Amused to Death'' topped out at around one million and there was no tour in support of the album.

===1999 – 2004：In the Flesh巡演和《迷墙》的百老汇制作===
In 1999, after a 12-year hiatus from touring and a seven-year absence from the music industry, Waters embarked on the In the Flesh tour, performing both solo and Pink Floyd material. The tour was a financial success in the US and though Waters had booked mostly smaller venues, tickets sold so well that many of the concerts were upgraded to larger ones.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 329–334}} The tour eventually stretched across the world and would span three years. A concert film was released on CD and DVD, named ''[[In_the_Flesh_–_Live|In the Flesh – Live]]''. During the tour, he played two new songs "Flickering Flame" and "Each Small Candle" as the final encore to many of the shows. In June 2002, he completed the tour with a performance in front of 70,000 people at the [[Glastonbury_Festival|Glastonbury Festival of Performing Arts]], playing 15 Pink Floyd songs and five songs from his solo catalogue.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=329–334}}

[[Miramax|Miramax]] announced in mid-2004 that a production of ''The Wall'' was to appear on Broadway with Waters playing a prominent role in the creative direction.

In July 2005, Waters reunited with Mason, Wright, and Gilmour for their final performance together at the 2005 [[Live_8|Live 8]] concert in London's Hyde Park, Pink Floyd's only appearance with Waters since their final performance of ''The Wall'' at Earls Court London 24 years earlier.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=237, 266–267}} They played a 23-minute set consisting of "[[Speak_to_Me|Speak to Me]]/[[Breathe_(Pink_Floyd_song)|Breathe]]"/"[[Breathe_(Reprise)|Breathe (Reprise)]]", "[[Money_(Pink_Floyd_song)|Money]]", "[[Wish_You_Were_Here_(Pink_Floyd_song)|Wish You Were Here]]", and "[[Comfortably_Numb|Comfortably Numb]]". Waters told the [[Associated_Press|Associated Press]] that while the experience of playing with Pink Floyd again was positive, the chances of a bona fide reunion would be "slight" considering his and Gilmour's continuing musical and ideological differences.{{sfn|Schaffner|1991|p= 308}} Though Waters had differing ideas about which songs they should play, he "agreed to roll over for one night only".{{sfn|Blake|2008|pp= 382–383}} In November 2005, Pink Floyd were inducted into the [[UK_Music_Hall_of_Fame|UK Music Hall of Fame]] by [[Pete_Townshend|Pete Townshend]] of [[the_Who|the Who]].<ref>{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p= 386}}</ref>

In September 2005, Waters released ''{{lang|fr|[[Ça_Ira_(opera)|Ça Ira]]}}'' (pronounced {{IPA-fr|sa iˈʁa|}}, French for "it will be fine"; Waters added the subtitle, "There is Hope"), an opera in three acts translated from the late [[Étienne_Roda-Gil|Étienne Roda-Gil]]'s French libretto based on the historical subject of the [[French_Revolution|French Revolution]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1= Tsioulcas|first1= Anastasia|title= Waters' New Concept |magazine=Billboard|date= 27 August 2005|page=45 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-BIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA45&dq=ca+ira+Nadine+Roda-Gil#v=onepage&q=ca%20ira%20Nadine%20Roda-Gil&f=false |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref> ''{{lang|fr|Ça Ira}}'' was released as a double CD album, featuring baritone [[Bryn_Terfel|Bryn Terfel]], soprano [[Ying_Huang_(soprano)|Ying Huang]] and tenor [[Paul_Groves_(tenor)|Paul Groves]].{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp= 324–325}} Set during the early French Revolution, the original libretto was co-written in French by Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye. Waters had begun rewriting the libretto in English in 1989,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p= 256}} and said about the composition: "I've always been a big fan of Beethoven's choral music, [[Hector_Berlioz|Berlioz]] and [[Alexander_Borodin|Borodin]] ... This is unashamedly romantic and resides in that early 19th-century tradition, because that's where my tastes lie in classical and choral music."{{sfn|Blake|2008|p= 392}} Waters appeared on television to discuss the opera, but the interviews often focused instead on his relationship with Pink Floyd, something Waters would "take in stride", a sign Pink Floyd biographer [[Mark_Blake_(writer)|Mark Blake]] believes is "a testament to his mellower old age or twenty years of dedicated psychotherapy".{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=392}} ''{{lang|fr|Ça Ira}}'' reached number 5 on the ''Billboard'' Classical Music Chart in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/charts/2005-10-15/classical-albums |title=Roger Waters: ''Ça Ira''|work=Billboard|accessdate=17 February 2013}}</ref>

In June 2006, Waters commenced [[The_Dark_Side_of_the_Moon_Live|The Dark Side of the Moon Live]] tour, a two-year, world-spanning effort that began in Europe in June and North America in September. The first half of the show featured both Pink Floyd songs and Waters' solo material, while the second half included a complete live performance of the 1973 Pink Floyd album ''The Dark Side of the Moon'', the first time in over three decades that Waters had performed the album. The shows ended with an encore from the third side of ''The Wall''. He used elaborate staging by concert lighting designer [[Marc_Brickman|Marc Brickman]] complete with laser lights, fog machines, pyrotechnics, psychedelic projections, and inflatable floating puppets (Spaceman and Pig) controlled by a "handler" dressed as a butcher, and a full 360-degree [[quadraphonic_sound|quadraphonic sound]] system was used. Nick Mason joined Waters for ''The Dark Side of the Moon'' set and the encores on select 2006 tour dates.{{sfn|Povey|2008|pp=319, 334–338}} Waters continued touring in January 2007 in Australia and New Zealand, then Asia, Europe, South America, and back to North America in June.

In March 2007, the Waters song, "Hello (I Love You)" was featured in the science fiction film ''[[The_Last_Mimzy|The Last Mimzy]]''. The song plays over the film's end credits. He released it as a single, on CD and via download, and described it as, "a song that captures the themes of the movie, the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day".<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/reminder-pink-floyd-rock-icon-roger-waters-records-hello-i-love-you-original-song-new-712330.htm |title= Reminder – Pink Floyd Rock Icon Roger Waters Records "Hello (I Love You)", an Original Song for New Line Cinema's "The Last Mimzy" |publisher= [[Marketwire|Marketwire]] |date= January 2007 |accessdate= 29 June 2015 |archive-date= 2016-03-04 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052921/http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/reminder-pink-floyd-rock-icon-roger-waters-records-hello-i-love-you-original-song-new-712330.htm |dead-url= no }}</ref> He performed at California's [[Coachella_Valley_Music_and_Arts_Festival|Coachella Festival]] in April 2008 and was to be among the headlining artists performing at [[Live_Earth_India_2008#Live_Earth_India_2008|Live Earth 2008]] in Mumbai, India in December 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.nme.com/news/roger-waters/41209|title=Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to join Bon Jovi at Live Earth India|work=NME|date=21 November 2008|accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref> but that concert was cancelled in light of the [[2008_Mumbai_attacks|26 November terrorist attacks]] in Mumbai.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/dec/01/live-earth-india-cancelled|title=Live Earth India cancelled after Mumbai attacks|first= Sean |last= Michaels|date= 1 December 2008|work=[[The_Guardian|The Guardian]]|accessdate=18 October 2010|location=London}}</ref>

After leaving Britain, he moved to [[Long_Island|Long Island]] in New York with his fiancé Laurie Durning. In June 2007, Waters became a spokesman for [[Millennium_Promise|Millennium Promise]], a non-profit organisation that helps fight extreme poverty and [[malaria|malaria]]. He wrote an opinion piece for [[CNN|CNN]] in support of the topic.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/africa/06/08/waters.commentary/index.html |title= Waters: Something can be done about extreme poverty|publisher= CNN|first=Roger|last=Waters|date=11 June 2007|accessdate=18 October 2010}}</ref> In July, he participated in the American leg of the [[Live_Earth_concert,_New_York_City|Live Earth]] concert, an international multi-venue concert aimed at raising awareness about global climate change, featuring the Trenton Youth Choir and his trademarked inflatable pig. Waters told [[David_Fricke|David Fricke]] why he thinks ''The Wall'' is still relevant today:

{{quote|The loss of a father is the central prop on which [''The Wall''] stands. As the years go by, children lose their fathers again and again, for nothing. You see it now with all these fathers, good men and true, who lost their lives and limbs in Iraq for no reason at all. I've done "[[Bring_The_Boys_Back_Home|Bring The Boys Back Home]]" in my encore on recent tours. It feels more relevant and poignant to be singing that song now than it did in 1979.{{sfn|Fricke|2009|p=74}}}}

In 2012, Waters led a benefit for United States military veterans called Stand Up for Heroes. He invited a music group of combat wounded veterans called [[MusiCorps|MusiCorps]] to perform with him.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/09/roger-waters-veterans-stand-up-for-heroes-benefit_n_2099380.html|last=Carucci|first=John|title=Roger Waters & Veterans Perform Together At Stand Up for Heroes Benefit|work=Huffington Post|date=9 November 2012|accessdate=19 May 2013}}</ref> In June 2013, Waters and numerous other celebrities appeared in a video showing support for [[Chelsea_Manning|Chelsea Manning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys|last=Gavin|first=Patrick|date=19 June 2013|title=Celeb video: 'I am Bradley Manning'|publisher=Politico|accessdate=2018-06-06|archive-date=2014-01-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110180932/http://www.politico.com/story/2013/06/celebrity-bradley-manning-video-93041.html#ixzz2WgfpNmys|dead-url=no}}</ref>

Waters' primary instrument in Pink Floyd was the electric bass guitar. He briefly played a [[Höfner|Höfner]] bass but replaced it with a [[Rickenbacker_4001|Rickenbacker RM-1999/4001S]], until 1970 when it was stolen along with the rest of the band's equipment in New Orleans.{{sfn|Povey|2008|p=14}} He began using [[Fender_Precision_Bass|Fender Precision Bass]]es in 1968, originally alongside the Rickenbacker 4001, and then exclusively after the Rickenbacker was lost in 1970. First seen at a concert in Hyde Park, London in July 1970, the black P-Bass was rarely used until April 1972 when it became his main stage guitar and as of 2 October 2010, the basis for a Fender Artist Signature model.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.fender.com/series/artist/roger-waters-precision-bass/ |title= Roger Waters Precision Bass |publisher= [[Fender_Musical_Instruments_Corporation|Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]] |accessdate= 9 October 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130112075529/http://www.fender.com/series/artist/roger-waters-precision-bass/ |archivedate= 12 January 2013}}</ref> Waters endorses [[RotoSound|RotoSound]] Jazz Bass 77 flat-wound strings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rotosound.com/endorsees.php|title=Rotosound Endorsees|publisher=Rotosound|accessdate=23 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205210630/http://www.rotosound.com/endorsees.php|archivedate=5 February 2011}}</ref> Throughout his career he has used [[The_Selmer_Company|Selmer]], [[Watkins_Electric_Music|WEM]], [[Hiwatt|Hiwatt]] and [[Ashdown_Engineering|Ashdown]] amplifiers but has used [[Ampeg|Ampeg]] for the last few tours, also employing [[delay_(audio_effect)|delay]], [[tremolo|tremolo]], [[chorus_effect|chorus]], [[stereo_panning|stereo panning]] and [[Phaser_(effect)|phaser]] effects in his bass playing.{{sfn|Fitch|2005|pp=416–430, 441–445}}
