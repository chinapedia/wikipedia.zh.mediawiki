<!--==劇情==

Finn and Jake dig up a box of treasure that Jake had found in the landfill and had buried without opening. When they open the box, the two discover a plethora of [[VHS|VHS]] tapes. Finn recognizes them, noting that he saw Ice King bury them in the dump awhile ago. The two make plans for a secret tape watching; Jake puts up flyers warning people that the only ones allowed to attend are Finn, Jake, and BMO. However, the Ice King, seeing one of the posters, decides he wants to watch them too, unaware that the tapes are his. Meanwhile, Finn and Jake start to watch the tapes and discover that they comprise the Ice King's boring and somewhat disturbing video journals.

After watching several entries, Finn and Jake think there might be a secret code hidden in the tapes. BMO apparently cracks the code, revealing that all of the tapes contain an encoded picture of Gunter, the Ice King's penguin. The Ice King, unable to get into Finn and Jake's house, raises an army of snowmen and tries to break in by force. Finn and Jake, realizing what is going on, hide under their bed and keep watching the tapes, hoping to discover a secret about Ice King. Soon, the tapes cut to an ominous recording of man who introduces himself as Simon Petrikov. Simon, an antiquarian, explains that he bought a magical crown and, after placing it on his head, began to lose his mind. Finn and Jake realize that Simon is the same person as the Ice King, and the two take pity on him.

==Production==
[[File:Tom_Kenny_by_Gage_Skidmore.jpg|thumb]]'s voice acting in the episode was likened to dramatic narration from a [[radio_drama|radio drama]] by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]].]]
"Holly Jolly Secrets" was written and storyboarded by [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]] and Somvilay Xayaphone from a story developed by Mark Banker, Patrick McHale, Osborne, and series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]]. The entry was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]]. The genesis for this episode was [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]]'s suggestion that the show create a holiday special. Ward wanted "to do a Christmas episode without doing Christmas", but found that it was too difficult to "just dance around" the holiday.<ref name=ign1/> Originally, Ward's idea for the episode was to do it in the style of ''[[Mystery_Science_Theater_3000|Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', featuring Finn and Jake digging up actual Christmas specials, and having them comment on them. This would have entailed a mixing of live-action and traditional animation, but Ward eventually rejected this idea, because the mixing of live action with the animation would have destroyed the world that the cast and crew had spent three seasons creating.<ref name=ign1/><ref name=wardholly1>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014. "Holly Jolly Secrets, Pt. 1" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Three [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> To make up for this last-minute change of plans, the writers had to replace the Christmas specials with "the Ice King's odd home movies".<ref name=ign1/> McHale then crafted the story involving Simon Petrikov, a move that Ward called "brilliant". When it came time for [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]] to record his lines, Ward explained that it "felt like such an authentic, old-time radio horror drama".<ref name=ign1>{{cite web|last=Fowler|first=Matt|title=Adventure Time Creator: It's Awesome If We Give People Nightmares|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/03/05/adventure-time-creator-its-awesome-if-we-give-people-nightmares|work=[[IGN|IGN]]|publisher=[[News_Corporation|News Corporation]]|accessdate=May 31, 2013|date=March 5, 2012}}</ref>

[[Adam_Muto|Adam Muto]] boarded the video that Finn and Jake fast forward; the crew noted that the scene in question required three times the work in order for the fast-forward joke to work.<ref name=wardholly1/><ref name=mutoholly1>Muto, Adam (Storyboard artist). 2014. "Holly Jolly Secrets, Pt. 1" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Three [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> During one of the scenes in which the Ice King is bemoaning his situation via video tape, Osborne placed a faux [[Bumper_(broadcasting)|bumper]] that read "You're watching an ''Adventure Time'' Christmas special! [[Ho_ho_ho|Ho ho ho]]!", with the joke being that the cheeriness of the bumper undercut the extreme sadness of the Ice King. Many people on the [[Internet|Internet]], however, though that the bumper was real.<ref name=kentholly2>Osborne, Kent (Storyboard artist). 2014.

The episode makes use of "The Fry Song", written by [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]], that had originally appeared in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_2)|second season]] premiere, "[[It_Came_from_the_Nightosphere|It Came from the Nightosphere]]".<ref name=wardholly2/><ref name=sugar>Sugar, Rebecca (Storyboard artist). 2013. "It Came from the Nightosphere" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Two [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> Kenny had recorded this version of the song after "It Came from the Nightosphere" aired just for fun, but the crew liked it so much that it eventually made its way into the second part of "Holly Jolly Secrets".<ref name=wardholly2>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014. "Holly Jolly Secrets, Pt. 2" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Three [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> The score for the episode was composed by Tim Kiefer. One particular song, titled "Old Cold Footage", that Kiefer composed was supposed to accompany the scene featuring the Ice King's video diary.  This track, however, was excised from the episode and "never [saw] the light of day" until Kiefer posted it onto his official website.<ref name=oldcold/> He later uploaded it onto his official [[Soundcloud|Soundcloud]] account as well.<ref name=oldcold>{{cite web|last=Kiefer|first=Tim|title=Old Cold Footage (Outtake)|url=http://nastysonix.com/post/34595271991/an-at-outtake-old-cold-footage-heres-a-tiny|publisher=NastySonix.com|accessdate=October 5, 2013|date=October 29, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Kiefer|first=Tim|title=Old Cold Footage (Outtake)|url=https://soundcloud.com/staypuft/old-cold-footage-outtake|publisher=[[Soundcloud|Soundcloud]]|accessdate=October 5, 2013|year=2012}}</ref>

Erik Adams of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' noted that Finn and Jake finding the Ice King's home tapes led to a "disturbingly intimate holiday special." He later jokingly noted that "Penguin Dance Parties [are] what Christmas is all about, [[Charlie_Brown|Charlie Brown]]."<ref>{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Erik|title='Holly Jolly Secrets' {{!}} Adventure Time {{!}} TV Club|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/holly-jolly-secrets,66081/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130219010821/http://www.avclub.com/articles/holly-jolly-secrets%2C66081/|archivedate=February 19, 2013|work=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
