<!--==劇情==
After Finn watched his girlfriend, Flame Princess (voiced by [[Jessica_DiCicco|Jessica DiCicco]]) and Ice King (voiced by [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]]) fight, he has a strange dream that gives him a sense of pleasure; however, he is not able to finish it before he wakes up. Upon awakening, he realizes that the Cosmic Owl (voiced by [[M._Emmet_Walsh|M. Emmet Walsh]]) was in the vision, which Jake interprets to mean that the reverie was a prophetic dream. Jake urges Finn to somehow finish the dream. Finn, therefore, gets Flame Princess and Ice King to fight once more, but this time Ice King nearly defeats Flame Princess. That night, Finn has a similar dream, only this time, he imagines Ice King blasting him with ice.

The following day, Finn—in an attempt to once again finish his pleasurable dream—delivers forged notes to both Flame Princess and Ice King; these notes incite the two to fight once again, only this time, Flame Princess grows immense with rages and begins melting the ice kingdom. Finn, realizing that he caused this situation, saves the Ice King and confronts Flame Princess, telling her the truth. Hurt and saddened, she breaks up with Finn and leaves the ice kingdom in ruins.

"Frost & Fire" was written and storyboarded by Luke Pearson and Somvilay Xayaphone, from a story by [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], Jack Pendarvis, and [[Adam_Muto|Adam Muto]].<ref name=episodecitation>{{cite episode| title=Frost & Fire| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Elizabeth Ito & Nick Jennings (directors); Luke Pearson & Somvilay Xayaphone (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=August 5, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 30}}</ref> This episode was the last fifth season episode to feature Pearson as a freelance storyboard artist, although he would return to revise storyboards in "Earth & Water".<ref>{{cite web|last=Muto|first=Adam|title=Luke Pearson did 'Frost & Fire' and 'Candy Streets', but what was the other episode that he was a storyboard revisionist for|url=http://new.spring.me/#!/MrMuto/q/586441191717889207|publisher=[[Formspring|Formspring]]|accessdate=May 2, 2014|date=May 2, 2014}}</ref> The episode also marked the first episode that Pendarvis worked on; Pendarvis joined the writing team in October 2012, after Osborne, a friend of his, asked him to freelance write for the series for two weeks.

Santino Lascano, one of the series' background artists and veteran from the show' [[Adventure_Time_(season_1)|first season]], noted on his [[Tumblr|Tumblr]] that the episode had "a relatively light workload" because it stuck largely to "familiar" locations, such as the Tree Fort and the Ice Kingdom.<ref name=lascano/> With that being said, Lascano noted that it was "fun to 'destroy' places [that he] was involved in creating way back in Season 1",<ref name=lascano>{{cite web|last=Lascano|first=Santino|title=Some 'Frost and Fire' Backgrounds|url=http://santinolascano.tumblr.com/post/57478444954/some-frost-and-fire-backgrounds-that-i-designed|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=May 2, 2014|date=August 5, 2013}}</ref> a reference to him having helped Dan "Ghostshrimp" James develop the initial look for the series.<ref name=timeforsome>{{cite web|last=DeMott|first=Rick|title=Time for Some Adventure with Pendleton Ward|url=http://www.awn.com/articles/2d/time-some-adventure-pendleton-ward|publisher=[[Animation_World_Network|Animation World Network]]|accessdate=January 18, 2013|date=April 25, 2010}}</ref><ref name=ghosts>{{cite web|last=Ghostshrimp|title=As Seen On Television|url=http://www.ghostshrimp.net/pages/quicklook/BROADCASThome.html|publisher=Ghostshrimp.net|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Frederator Production Art|url=http://frederator.tumblr.com/page/70?route=%2Fpage%2F%3Apage|publisher=[[Frederator|Frederator]]|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

He was also complimentary towards the climactic battle between Flame Princess and Ice King, describing it as a "[[Kaiju|Kaiju]] Flame Princess vs. Kaiju Ice King battle".<ref name=avclub/> Ultimately, Sava concluded that the episode is proof that "''Adventure Time'' isn’t afraid of changing its characters, and Finn has a major learning experience this week as he sabotages his relationship."<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Review: Adventure Time: 'Frost & Fire'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-frost-fire-101093|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
