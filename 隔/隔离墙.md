'''隔離圍牆'''（[[英語|英語]]：'''separation barriers'''）是指在兩個國家或地區相交之處，為了防止人們跨越[[国境|邊界]]而建造的圍牆或類似設施。這些圍牆通常是依據[[測繪學|測繪學]]上的國境邊界所建造。最著名的例子可算是位於[[中國|中國]]的[[萬里長城|萬里長城]]，是為了抵御游牧民族而興建；而較近期的著名例子則是在[[冷戰|冷戰]]期間[[東德|東德]]所建造的與[[西德|西德]]分隔的[[柏林圍牆|柏林圍牆]]，以及[[以色列|以色列]]在[[約旦河西岸地區|約旦河西岸地區]]修建的分隔[[巴勒斯坦|巴勒斯坦]]的围墙。

*[[軍事分界線|軍事分界線]]
*[[韓國停戰區|韓國停戰區]]
*[[韓國圍牆|韓國圍牆]]

==== 中國 ====
[[中華人民共和國|中華人民共和國]]有兩個[[特別行政區|特別行政區]]，是位在[[中國南方|中國南方]]的[[香港|香港]]和[[澳門|澳門]]。這兩個地區和[[廣東省|廣東省]]的交界處仍然保有受到管制的邊界圍牆，在通過時須接受[[身份证|身份证件]]的查驗。

广东省中山市和珠海市之间也有一段隔离墙，具体的位置在105国道华财古玩城至上冲检查站路段，现在隔离墙已经破败不堪，以前从中山市往珠海市过境时需要出示边境证，边境证需要提前办理，现在已不再作身份检查。2010年，珠海市修建105国道两旁的排水管道时，顺便拆除了105国道一旁破败不堪的隔离墙。

香港曾是[[英國|英國]]的[[英國海外領地|海外領地]]，直到在1997年將[[主權|主權]][[香港回歸|移交給中國]]，而澳門則也曾是[[葡萄牙|葡萄牙]]的特別領地，之後在1999年[[澳門回歸|澳門回歸]][[中華人民共和國|中華人民共和國]]。在回歸之前，香港和澳門與廣東省的交界處被視為國與國之間的[[國境|邊境]]，相当于国境。

在[[一國兩制|一國兩制]]的基礎下，這兩個特別行政區在回歸後，仍然保有自己的[[海關|海關]]與[[移民|移民]]政策。由於澳門和香港的政策與中國大陸不同，因此兩地和廣東省邊界仍然受到管制，两地与内地的界线非[[国境|国境]]，但为[[边境|边境]]。

[[香港|香港]]在和廣東省[[深圳市|深圳市]]之間有一道長32公里的圍牆，配有影像偵測器、燈光和[[閉路電視|閉路電視]]，同時也有警察定時巡邏。在[[深圳河|深圳河]]（地理上的邊界）南方有一處進出受到管制的農業區域，是面積為28平方公里（km²）的[[香港邊境禁區|邊境禁區]]。目前，三條通過邊境的道路位於[[沙頭角|沙頭角]]、[[文錦渡|文錦渡]]和[[落馬洲|落馬洲]]，而有一條鐵路穿越邊境前往[[羅湖|羅湖]]。香港居民必須持有[[香港身份證|香港身份證]]及經[[廣東省公安廳|廣東省公安廳]]核准的[[回鄉證|回鄉證]]才可過境。

[[澳門|澳門]]與[[珠海市|珠海市]]有340米的邊境，位於[[關閘|關閘]]。邊境配備了54個櫃檯為旅客和容許8架車輛通行。1999年[[蓮花大橋|蓮花大橋]]開放前，關閘是澳門及中國內地唯一邊境連接的地區。現時兩個邊境地區均容許過境前往珠海市。

中國亦於2006年在[[中朝邊境|中朝邊境]]修建隔離牆。

And then let us see what is happening in Afghanistan. Why don't they agree to this, I've said this openly many times before, they don't do it, for whatever are their reasons. I know how effective the fence, the Indian fence which is about 1,800 kilometres, and they are fencing the Kashmir mountains also, it is so difficult.

2006年1月，[[阿富汗|阿富汗]]政府裁定包括[[聯合國|聯合國]]、美國[[外交代表機構|大使館]]等位於[[喀布爾|喀布爾]]的外交機構，必須建造混凝土的安全圍牆來保護其建築。在喀布爾的大部分街道上，都可以看見許多安全圍牆和混凝土防爆磚牆，以防止[[塔利班|塔利班]]政權瓦解後在過去四年內開始的暴動和[[恐怖攻擊|恐怖攻擊]]。

<!--The decree follows pressure from the newly formed [[Politics_of_Afghanistan|Afghan parliament]] and public complaints over the heavy traffic jams caused by the barriers. The foreign groups are expressing concern and saying that the security situation does not permit that. The United Nations is one of the organizations concerned by the [[Politics_of_Afghanistan|Afghan government's]] order. [[United_Nations|UN]] chief spokesman in Kabul Adrian Edwards said that security barriers are still required. "We are in a difficult security environment which certainly hasn't improved during [[2005|2005]]", Edwards said. "There have been a number of [[suicide_attacks|suicide attacks]]. Within the UN here, I think none of us would wish to be behind these barricades, we would prefer things could be open as we are in some other countries.

A [[demilitarized_zone|neutral territory]] exists between [[Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] and [[Spain|Spain]]. A strip of land of width "600 [[Mesures_usuelles|toises]], being more than two cannon shots distance between the British guns and the Spanish guns" would be considered "the neutral ground" stipulated by the [[Treaty_of_Seville|Treaty of Seville]] in 1729. In 1908 the [[United_Kingdom|British]] constructed a fence at the British side of the neutral territory. In order not to offend the Spanish, the fence was actually one metre inside British territory. Even though both the [[United_Kingdom|United Kingdom]] and Spain are part of the [[European_Union|European Union]], the border fence is still relevant today since [[Gibraltar|Gibraltar]] maintains its [[tax_haven|tax haven]] status.

The official reason for the fence is to stop the spread of foot-and-mouth disease among livestock. Zimbabweans argue that the height of the fence is clearly intended to keep out people. Botswana has responded that the fence is designed to keep out cattle, and to ensure that entrants have their shoes disinfected at legal border crossings. Botswana also argued that the government continues to encourage legal movement into the country. Zimbabwe was unconvinced, and the barrier remains a source of tension between the two nations.-->

In 1975 a 75-mile (120-kilometer) high security fence was erected by [[South_Africa|South Africa]] to keep the violent revolution in [[Mozambique|Mozambique]] from spilling into [[Kruger_National_Park|Kruger National Park]].  [http://home.telkomsa.net/leveypa/Kruger/imagepages/Dsc00042.html]
In 1990 it was reported:
{{cquote|Concern is growing in South Africa over the country's use of a lethal, 3,300 [[volt|volt]] at 1 amp electrified fence on its borders with Mozambique and [[Zimbabwe|Zimbabwe]]. According to a report recently published by the South African Catholic Bureau for Refugees, the fence has caused more deaths in three years than the [[Berlin_Wall|Berlin Wall]] did in its entire history. Local people call the fence the 'Snake of Fire'. There have been calls by South African church leaders over the past months for the fence to be switched off permanently. Most of its victims have been women and children fleeing the war in Mozambique. The Berlin Wall resulted in 80 deaths over 28 years. Official figures provided by the [[South_African_Defence_Force|South African Defence Force]] (SADF) indicate that 89 people were electrocuted at the fence between August 1986 and August 1989. Church leaders dispute these figures, and claim that the true figure is nearer 200 each year.<ref>[http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12517011.000-hundreds-killed-by-south-africas-border-fence-.html/ 'Hundreds killed' by South Africa's border fence, New Scientist, Issue 1701, January 27, 1990].</ref>}}

A treaty signed on December 9, 2002 by the presidents of three countries - South Africa, Mozambique, and Zimbabwe allowed for the fence to be torn down in order to open the ancient [[elephant|elephant]] migration route between South Africa and Mozambique which was disrupted by the fence. The 13,513-square mile (35,000 square kilometer) [[Great_Limpopo_Transfrontier_Park|Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park]] will connect the parks of three countries: South Africa's [[Kruger_National_Park|Kruger National Park]], Mozambique's [[Limpopo_National_Park|Limpopo National Park]], and Zimbabwe's [[Gonarezhou_National_Park|Gonarezhou National Park]]. <ref>[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/02/0211_030211_limpopo.html/ Cross-Border Park Is Africa's Largest Wildlife Refuge, National Geographic Society, February 11, 2003].</ref>

In 2005 it was reported that only a relatively small portion of the high-security border fence separating South Africa’s Kruger National Park with Zimbabwe's Gonarezhou Park has been removed. Security concerns, especially about illegal immigrants and the smuggling of weapons and four-wheel-drive vehicles, have been hindering the removal of more sections of the border fence between the Kruger and Limpopo parks. <ref>[http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&click_id=31&art_id=vn20050327135740672C194658/ Kruger elephants head for Mozambique, Independent Online, March 27, 2005].</ref>

[[File:mozam-sa-fence.jpg|thumb]]-[[Mozambique|Mozambique]] border.]]

Additional Note: The actual number of deaths on the fence is closer to 3,000 up to 1989. In addition, the bulk of transgressors were considered terrorists of the day. Most tried to come across outfitted with mines, the raw materials for mines, handguns and automatic weapons such as the AK47. In one instance an RPG7 was being carried. The book "With Malice and Forethought, D. Meckanic, ISBN 1-4196-3926-9" explains the construction of the fences, their locations, the technology driving them and the body count. These electrified fences were also used to protect military bases and assets, generating stations and other key-point installations, such as Standerton, Kendall and Rand Water Board. The Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Swaziland borders were not the only area of application. An image of the fence (used with permission), during its construction between Komatipoort and the Satara River, can be seen at the following link. The image looks south towards Komatipoort.-->
