== 句子的背景和意思 ==

故事起自有兩個學生，James（詹姆斯）和John（約翰）。他們曾經需要在一個[[英語|英語]]考試上描述一個曾經着涼的人。約翰寫的句子是“The man had a cold”，這句在[[文法|文法]]上不正確；而詹姆斯寫的句子在文法上正確：“The man had had a cold”。老師於是註記「由於詹姆斯的答案是正確的，所以它對於老師有一個較好的效果。」

如果加了標點符號，這句句子會比較清楚：

{{quote|James, while John had had "had", had had "had had"; "had had" had had a better effect on the teacher.<ref>[http://www.amrita.edu/icpc/2006/Problems-Onsite.pdf "Problem C: Operator Jumble"] {{Wayback|url=http://www.amrita.edu/icpc/2006/Problems-Onsite.pdf |date=20090509011715 }}. 31st ACM International Collegiate Programming Conference, 2006–2007.</ref>}}
{{Quote|（翻译：詹姆斯在当约翰用“had”时用了“had had”，老师认为“had had”的效果更好。）}}

如果重排句子，意思會更清楚：
{{quote|James had had "had had", while John had had "had"; "had had" had had a better effect on the teacher.}}
{{Quote|（翻译：詹姆斯用了“had had”，而约翰用了“had”，老师认为“had had”的效果更好。）}}

== 應用 ==

這句子可以作為一個文法遊戲<ref name="GADFLY">{{cite news| last = Amon| first = Mike| title = GADFLY| url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-20149031_ITM| accessdate = 2009-04-30| date = 2004-01-28| publisher = Financial Times| quote = HAD up to here?

London: Collier-MacMillan. Exercise 3-4, p.405; solution p.417.</ref>

在說明人們如何理解環境中不同信息的意義是，这个句子被用来证明看似随意的决定能极大地改变其意义。类似于句子中标点符号的变化如何使老師時而喜欢詹姆斯的作品，時而喜歡约翰的作品。例子：「James, while John had had "had," had...」與「James, while John had had "had had,"...」。<ref name="Weick">{{cite book| last = Weick| first = Karl E.| title = Making Sense of the Organization| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=agZzW4mqS4wC&pg=PA186&dq=%22Had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had%22#PPA186,M1| accessdate = 2009-04-30| edition = 8th| year = 2005| publisher = [[Wiley-Blackwell|Wiley-Blackwell]]| isbn = 0631223193| pages = 186–187| quote = Once a person has generated/bracketed part of the stream, then the activities of punctuation and connection (parsing) can occur in an effort to transform the raw data into information.| archive-date = 2020-10-31| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201031012110/https://books.google.com/books?id=agZzW4mqS4wC&pg=PA186&dq=%22Had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had%22#PPA186,M1| dead-url = no}}</ref>

这句话也是为了显示「had」（完了）的语义模糊性，也是为了说明用字和提字的区别<ref name="Lecercle">{{cite book| last = Lecercle| first = Jean-Jacques| title = The violence of language| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=sNUNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA86&dq=%22Had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had%22#PPA86,M1| accessdate = 2009-04-30| edition = Illustrated| year = 1990| publisher = [[Routledge|Routledge]]| isbn = 0415034310| page = 86| quote = Suppose I decide that I wish to make up a sentence containing eleven occurrences of the word 'had' in a row ...| archive-date = 2020-05-07| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200507135503/https://books.google.com/books?id=sNUNAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA86&dq=%22Had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had%22#PPA86,M1| dead-url = no}}</ref>。也有人以它为例，说明语言的复杂性、语言的解释及其对人的认知的影响<ref name="Hollin">{{cite book| last = Hollin| first = Clive R.| title = Contemporary Psychology: An Introduction| url = http://books.google.com/books?id=DTpm_oT51aQC&pg=PA34&dq=%22Had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had+had%22| accessdate = 2009-04-30| edition = Illustrated| year = 1995| publisher = [[Routledge|Routledge]]| isbn = 0748401911| page = 34| quote = Do readers make use of the ways in which sentences are structured?}}</ref>。

为了让读者清楚地了解句法结构，这个句子至少要求两个短语之间用分号、句号、横线分开。不过，贾斯珀·福尔德的小说《失落的情节之井》还是采用了这一短语的变体，以说明即使是标点良好的写作也可能产生混乱<ref name="Fforde">{{Cite book|last=Fforde|first=Jasper|authorlink=Jasper Fforde|title=The Well of Lost Plots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7FBhAt0-kGAC|accessdate=2012-04-30|year=2003|publisher=[[Hodder_&_Stoughton|Hodder & Stoughton]]|quote=|archive-date=2020-11-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201104235738/https://books.google.com/books?id=7FBhAt0-kGAC|dead-url=no}}</ref>：<blockquote class="templatequote">""Okay," said the Bellman, whose head was in danger of falling apart like a [[chocolate_orange|chocolate orange]], "let me get this straight: ''David Copperfield'', unlike ''Pilgrim’s Progress'', which had had 'had', had had 'had had'.
