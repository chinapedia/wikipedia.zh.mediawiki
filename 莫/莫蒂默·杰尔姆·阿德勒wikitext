'''莫蒂默·傑爾姆·阿德勒'''（{{lang-en|Mortimer Jerome Adler}}，{{bd|1902年|12月28日|2001年|6月28日|catIdx=A}}）是一名[[美国|美国]][[哲学家|哲学家]]。

==生平==
阿德勒于1902年12月28日出生在美国[[纽约市|纽约市]]的一个[[犹太|犹太]]移民家庭。14岁从中学輟學后，成为[[纽约太阳报_(便士报)|纽约太阳报]]的送稿人員，他当时立志想要成为一名[[记者|记者]]<ref name=McInerny>Ralph McInerny. [http://radicalacademy.com/adlerarticlemcinerny2.htm "Memento Mortimer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127005042/http://radicalacademy.com/adlerarticlemcinerny2.htm |date=2010-11-27 }}</ref>。不久，阿德勒开始在夜间学习写作课程，从中他发现以下作者堪称英雄:[[柏拉图|柏拉图]]、[[亚里斯多德|亚里斯多德]]、[[托马斯·阿奎那|托马斯·阿奎那]]、[[约翰·洛克|约翰·洛克]]、[[约翰·斯图尔特·密尔|约翰·斯图尔特·密尔]]等等<ref name=word-gems>[http://www.word-gems.com/philos.adler.died.html Mortimer Adler: 1902-2001 — The Day Philosophy Died] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410224053/http://www.word-gems.com/philos.adler.died.html |date=2011-04-10 }}</ref>。之后，他进入[[哥伦比亚大学|哥伦比亚大学]]继续学习，同时还向学生文艺杂志投稿。尽管由于没能通过必修的游泳测验，而没能获得学士学位（1983年，哥伦比亚大学授予了他一个荣誉学位以作为补偿），阿德勒还是留在了大学，最终得到了一个講師的位置，并获得了心理学博士学位<ref>[http://c250.columbia.edu/c250_celebrates/remarkable_columbians/mortimer_j_adler.html "Remarkable Columbians" Columbia U. website on Adler]</ref>。

1930年，阿德勒前往[[芝加哥大学|芝加哥大学]]，并由之前认识的朋友、新任校长[[羅伯特·梅納德·哈欽斯|羅伯特·梅納德·哈欽斯]]安排为芝加哥大学法学院的法律哲学教授。然而他受到了芝加哥的一些哲学家的质疑，这些人对他“能否胜任哲学教授这个职责怀有重大疑问”，并且抵制阿德勒成为该大学哲学系的一分子。而同时，阿德勒也是该学校法学院有史以来第一个非律师出身的教师。

''[[西方世界伟大名著|西方世界伟大名著]]''项目的发起人。<!-- He founded and served as director of the Institute for 哲学研究 in 1952。For a long time he was Chairman of the Board of Editors of [[大英百科全书|大英百科全书]], and influenced many of the policies of the 15th edition。He introduced the [[Paideia_Proposal|Paideia Proposal]] which resulted in his founding the Paideia Program, a grade-school 课程 centered around guided reading and discussion of difficult works (as judged for each grade).  With [[Max_Weismann|Max Weismann]]，他创建了伟大思想研究中心。 -->

<!-- 阿德勒 long strove to bring philosophy to the masses, and some of his works (such as ''[[如何阅读How_to_Read_a_Book|如何阅读How to Read a Book]]'') became popular bestsellers. 阿德勒 was often aided in his thinking and writing by Arthur Rubin, an old friend from his Columbia undergraduate days. In his own words:

<blockquote> Unlike many of my contemporaries, I never write books for my fellow professors to read.  I have no interest in the academic audience at all. I'm interested in Joe Doakes.  A general audience can read any book I write—and they do. </blockquote> 

阿德勒 took a long time in his own life to make up his mind about [[Theology|theological]] issues. He considered himself a [[pagan|pagan]] when he wrote  ''How to Think About God'' in [[1980|1980]]. In [http://www.marshillaudio.org/resources/volume_contents.asp?volumeID=51 Volume 51] of the Mars Hill Audio ''Journal'' ([[2001|2001]]), Ken Meyer includes his [[1980|1980]] interview with Adler, conducted after ''How to Think About God'' was published.  Meyer reminisces, "During that interview, I asked him why he had never embraced the [[基督教|基督教]] faith himself。He explained that while he had been profoundly influenced by a number of Christian thinkers during his life, ...there were moral—not intellectual—obstacles to his conversion. He didn't explain any further."

Meyer goes on to point out that Adler finally "surrendered to the hound of heaven" and "made a confession of faith and was [[baptism|baptized]]" only a few years after that interview. Offering insight into Adler's conversion, Meyer quotes Adler from a subsequent 1990年 article in ''基督教''杂志: "My chief reason for choosing 基督教was because the mysteries were incomprehensible. What's the point of revelation if we could figure it out ourselves? If it were wholly comprehensible, then it would just be 其他哲学。" 2000年，阿德勒成为一名[[天主教徒|天主教徒]].  He can be considered a 天主教哲学家 due to his lifelong participation in [[Neo-Thomist|Neo-Thomist]]运动，despite not being a Catholic for most of this time. -->

1980年，梅耶轻松地问阿德勒，如果他去一个荒岛，准备带哪些书，阿德勒回答说是以下11本:

阿德勒 was a controversial figure in some circles who saw his focus on the classics as eurocentric and dogmatic, and he was never afraid to speak his mind.阿德勒was also a [[world_federalism|world federalist]]. -->
