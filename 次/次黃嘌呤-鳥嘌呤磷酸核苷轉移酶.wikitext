HGPRT為一種[[轉移酶|轉移酶]]，可以催化將[[次黃嘌呤|次黃嘌呤]]轉換為[[肌苷酸|肌苷酸]]（IMP），也可將[[鳥嘌呤|鳥嘌呤]]的反應轉為[[單磷酸鳥苷|單磷酸鳥苷]]。這兩個反應都是將[[磷酸核糖焦磷酸|PRPP]]的5-磷酸核苷轉移至嘌呤上。HGPRT在[[核苷酸再利用合成途徑|核苷酸再利用合成途徑]]中扮演重要角色。

HGPRTase functions primarily to salvage purines from degraded DNA to reintroduce into purine synthetic pathways. In this role, it catalyzes the reaction between [[鳥嘌呤|guanine]] and [[磷酸核糖焦磷酸|phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate]] (PRPP) to form [[單磷酸鳥苷|GMP]], or between [[次黄嘌呤|hypoxanthine]] and [[磷酸核糖焦磷酸|phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate]] (PRPP) to form [[肌苷酸|inosine monophosphate]].

== 疾病中的角色 ==
此基因的突變往往導致[[高尿酸血症|高尿酸血症]]：
<!-- Mutations in the gene lead to [[高尿酸血症|hyperuricemia]]:-->
* 一些男性帶有部分程度的HGPRT缺陷（約低於正常活動量20%）並因此導致血液中高濃度的[[尿酸|尿酸]]。隨之而來的是[[痛風|痛風]]以及[[腎結石|腎結石]]。這症狀稱為[[萊希-尼亨症候群#輕微症狀|凱利-塞米勒症候群]]。<!--Some men have partial (up to 20% less activity of the enzyme) HGPRT deficiency that causes high levels of [[尿酸|uric acid]] in the blood, which leads to the development of gouty arthritis and the formation of uric acid stones in the urinary tract. This condition has been named the {{tsl|en|Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome||Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome}}.--><ref name="pmid9651092">{{citejournal | vauthors = Khattak FH, Morris IM, Harris K | title = Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome: a case report and review of the literature | journal = British Journal of Rheumatology | volume = 37 | issue = 5 | pages = 580–1 | date = May 1998 | pmid = 9651092 | doi = 10.1093/rheumatology/37.5.580c }}</ref>

* 某些基因突變可能導致[[痛風|痛風]]。發病的風險與hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase的缺陷程度成正比。
<!--Some mutations have been linked to [[痛风|gout]], the risk of which is increased in hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase deficiency.-->

* HPRT expression on the mRNA and protein level is induced by hypoxia inducible factor 1 ({{tsl|en|HIF1A||HIF1A}}).  HIF-1 is a [[转录因子|transcription factor]] that directs an array of cellular responses that are used for adaptation during oxygen deprivation.  This finding implies that HPRT is a critical pathway that helps preserve the cell's [[嘌呤|purine]] nucleotide resources under hypoxic conditions as found in pathology such as [[冠狀動脈疾病|myocardial ischemia]].<ref name="pmid25681585">{{citejournal | vauthors = Wu J, Bond C, Chen P, Chen M, Li Y, Shohet RV, Wright G | title = HIF-1α in the heart: Remodeling nucleotide metabolism | journal = Journal of Molecular and Cellular Cardiology | date = Feb 2015 | pmid = 25681585 | doi = 10.1016/j.yjmcc.2015.01.014| volume=82 | pages=194–200}}</ref>

They are created to produce [[单克隆抗体|monoclonal antibodies]] in biotechnology. {{tsl|en|HAT medium||HAT medium}} inhibits [[从头合成|de novo synthesis]] of nucleic acids, killing myeloma cells that cannot switch over to the [[补救途径|salvage pathway]], due to lack of HRPT1. The plasma cells in the culture eventually die from senesence, leaving pure hybridoma cells.
