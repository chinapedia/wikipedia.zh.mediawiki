== 沿革 ==
<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:LGAweb2.jpg|right]] 
Campbelltown was founded in 1820, named after Elizabeth Macquarie née Campbell, wife of the then Governor of New South Wales [[Lachlan_Macquarie|Lachlan Macquarie]]. The town was one of a series of south-western settlements being established by Macquarie at that time. Others include Ingleburn and [[Liverpool,_New_South_Wales|Liverpool]].

Campbelltown Council was originally incorporated in 1882. The present boundaries of the City of Campbelltown were largely formed in 1949, following the amalgamation of the Municipalities of Ingleburn (incorporated in April 1896) and Campbelltown, as part of a rationalisation of local government areas across New South Wales following World War II.

Campbelltown was designated in the early 1960s in the [[Sydney_Region_Outline_Plan|Sydney Region Outline Plan]], prepared by the [[Planning_Commission_of_New_South_Wales|Planning Commission of New South Wales]] as a satellite city, and a regional capital for the south west of Sydney. There was extensive building and population growth in the intervening time and the government surrounded the township with areas which were set aside for public and private housing and industry.

Campbelltown was declared a City by the Hon. P.H. Morton MLA, Minister for Local Government and Highways, on May 4, 1968. That same day saw the arrival of the first electric train to Campbelltown from Sydney.

As a City, Campbelltown honoured the 1st Signals Regiment (now the 1st Joins Support Unit) with the medieval custom of the Freedom of the City. The Mayor, Alderman Clive Tregear, wanted to recognise the contribution to the units based at the Ingleburn Army Barracks. The Regiment marched through Campbelltown until it got transferred to Queensland in the late 1980s.

Campbelltown was presented with its own coat of arms in 1969. The Arms were based those on the Arms of the Campbell Family in Scotland.

Campbelltown today acts as a significant regional centre for southwestern Sydney with a rail line, major hospital, university and several shopping centres.

<!--=== 州政治 ===
Labor candidates have dominated state and federal elections in Campbelltown over recent decades, and currently hold all four state electorates in Campbelltown.

The seat of Camden predominantly covers the neighbouring [[Camden_Council|Camden Council]], only including small parts of Campbelltown west of the Hume Highway, and is currently held by Labor's [[Geoff_Corrigan|Geoff Corrigan]], the former Mayor of Camden. The seat was won off the Liberal Party at the 2003 State election.

The seat of Campbelltown covers southern parts of the City of Campbelltown, and is held by Labor's [[Graham_West|Graham West]]. The seat was previously held by Olympics Minister [[Michael_Knight_(Australian_politician)|Michael Knight]], prior to his resignation in 2001, which triggered a by-election, won by Labor candidate [[Graham_West|Graham West]].

The seat of Macquarie Fields covers northern parts of Campbelltown and some of the newer estates of [[City_of_Liverpool|Liverpool]], and is held by Labor's Dr [[Andrew_McDonald_(Australian_politician)|Andrew McDonald]]. The seat was held for many years by senior NSW minister [[Craig_Knowles|Craig Knowles]], who retired in 2005 in conjunction with the retirement of Premier [[Bob_Carr|Bob Carr]] and Deputy Premier [[Andrew_Refshauge|Andrew Refshauge]]. Cr [[Steven_Chaytor|Steven Chaytor]], an advisor to former Prime Minister [[Gough_Whitlam|Gough Whitlam]] and Campbelltown City councillor, gained the seat in a September [[Macquarie_Fields_state_by-election,_2005|by-election]]. On January 19, 2007, Steven Chaytor withdrew as a candidate for Macquarie Fields for the March 2007 election, following his conviction for assaulting his former girlfriend, which was overturned on appeal after the 2007 election. He was replaced by Dr McDonald as Labor candidate, who went on to win the seat.

The seat of Wollondilly covers parts of southern Campbelltown, as well as covering [[Wollondilly_Shire|Wollondilly Shire]]. It was created in the 2006 NSW redistribution, and was first won at the 2007 election by former Wollondilly Mayor and Labor candidate Cr Phil Costa.

=== 聯邦政治 ===
Campbelltown is divided between two federal electorates, with the northern half of the city being taken in by the [[Division_of_Werriwa|Division of Werriwa]] and the southern half of the city being taken in by the [[Division_of_Macarthur|Division of Macarthur]].

Werriwa has been held by the [[Australian_Labor_Party|Australian Labor Party]] for over 70 years, and was held by [[Opposition_(parliamentary)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[Mark_Latham|Mark Latham]] prior to his resignation in early 2005. Following this [[Werriwa_by-election,_2005|by-election]] in March 2005, Labor's [[Chris_Hayes_(politician)|Chris Hayes]] was elected to the [[Australian_House_of_Representatives|House of Representatives]].

Macarthur has been traditionally a [[bellwether|bellwether]] seat, which shifted northwards into Campbelltown following the 1998 [[Redistribution_(Australia)|redistribution]]. While this redistribution made the seat, held at the time by former NSW Liberal Premier [[John_Fahey_(politician)|John Fahey]], notionally Labor, the nomination of former ultra-marathon runner [[Pat_Farmer|Pat Farmer]] for the Liberal party helped defeat the Labor Party, and the seat briefly became a safe Liberal seat. At the 2007 Australian Federal Election, however, Farmer suffered a massive swing against him and he retained the seat only narrowly.-->
