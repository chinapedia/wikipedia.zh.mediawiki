'''内河重炮舰'''（{{lang-en|'''River monitor'''}}），是一种在内河活动的最大类别的戰艦，安装最重可能的火炮。英文名称源自美國[[南北戰爭|南北戰爭]]期間{{link-en|聯邦海軍|Union Navy}}（北軍）旗下的{{link-en|莫尼特號蒸汽砲艦|USS Monitor|莫尼特號}}（USS Monitor）。

[[越戰|越戰]]時，由於內河作戰的需要，美國重新啟動自南北戰爭結束後就未曾再建置過的[[褐水海軍|褐水海軍]]（Brown-water navy）船隊，導入至少24艘搭載[[迫擊砲|迫擊砲]]或[[火焰噴射器|火焰噴射器]]的重砲艦參與在[[越南|越南]]的戰事，也成為此類型的軍艦最近期的服役記錄<ref>Carrico p. 10, 11</ref>。1966年7月，国防部长罗伯特·麦克纳马拉批准组建{{tsl|en|Mobile Riverine Force|机动江河部队}}。<ref>Carrico, p. 11</ref>一般有重装甲单炮塔的江河重炮舰。辖4个江河突击总队（River Assault Divisions, RAD）：

During the [[Vietnam_War|Vietnam War]], the [[United_States_Navy|United States Navy]], in conjunction with other riverine craft, commissioned 24 monitors, ten of which mounted a single 40 mm cannon in a Mk 52 turret, eight which mounted an M49 105 mm [[howitzer|howitzer]] within a T172 turret,<ref>Carrico, p. 27</ref> and six monitors which mounted two M10-8 flamethrowers from two M8 turrets located on either side of the vessel's 40 mm cannon. Referred to as "river battleships"<ref>Carrico, p. 20, 21, 63</ref> by their crews, they provided the firepower of the [[brown-water_navy|brown-water navy]].-->

[[第一次世界大战|第一次世界大战]]时，[[奥匈帝国|奥匈帝国]]与[[罗马尼亚王国|罗马尼亚王国]]在多瑙河上都部署了内河重炮舰。<!-- The Austro-Hungarian river monitor ''[[Yugoslav_monitor_Sava|Bodrog]]'' fired the first shots of [[World_War_I|World War I]], against the city of [[Belgrade|Belgrade]], and later also fought in the [[Romania_during_World_War_I|Romanian Campaign]], notably during the [[Flămânda_Offensive|Flămânda Offensive]] in October 1916, when she was damaged. Another river monitor, ''[[SMS_Körös|Körös]]'', was also heavily damaged by Romanian artillery, taking 12 hits and ran aground after her steam lines were severed.<ref>Michael B. Barrett, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 140</ref> On 22 September 1917, the [[Enns-class_river_monitor|''Enns''-class]] river monitor ''[[SMS_Inn|Inn]]'' was sunk by a Romanian mine near [[Brăila|Brăila]].<ref>Angus Konstam, ''Gunboats of World War I'', p. 29</ref><ref>René Greger, ''Austro-Hungarian warships of World War I'', p. 142</ref><ref>Mark Axworthy, Cornel I. Scafeș, Cristian Crăciunoiu, ''Third Axis, Fourth Ally: Romanian Armed Forces in the European War, 1941-1945'', p. 327</ref> She was refloated but her repairs were not completed before the War ended, and she was eventually handed over to Romania as war reparation, being renamed ''Basarabia''.<ref>René Greger, ''Austro-Hungarian Warships of World War I'', p. 142</ref>

During World War I, Romania had the largest river monitors on the Danube, displacing 680 tons, armed mainly with three 120 mm guns and protected by at least 70 mm of armor around the belt, turrets and conning tower. They were built in sections at [[Trieste|Triest]] in [[Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary]], transported to Romania by rail and assembled by the Romanians at the [[Galați_shipyard|Galați shipyard]] in 1907-1908.<ref>Robert Gardiner, ''Conway's All the World Fighting Ships 1906-1921'', p. 422</ref><ref>Roger Kafka, Roy L. Pepperburg, ''Warships of the World'', p. 881</ref><ref>Frederick Thomas Jane, ''Jane's Fighting Ships'', p. 343</ref> They did not engage enemy ships, however, instead they were used to support ground forces during the [[Battle_of_Turtucaia|Battle of Turtucaia]] and the [[First_Battle_of_Cobadin|First Battle of Cobadin]], and also took part in the [[Romania_during_World_War_I#1917_campaign_and_armistice|1917 campaign]], contributing to the stemming of the enemy advance.<ref>Spencer Tucker, Priscilla Mary Roberts, ''World War I: Encyclopedia, Volume 1'', p. 999</ref> During the Interwar period, the Romanian Danube Flotilla was the most powerful riverine fleet in the world.<ref>Axworthy, p. 327</ref> In 1924, the Romanian river monitors helped suppress the [[Tatarbunary_uprising|Tatarbunary uprising]], along with the entire Romanian Danube Flotilla.

[[File:Hlídková_loď_President_Masaryk_(2).jpg|thumb]]
Czechoslovakia had one monitor, {{ship||President Masaryk|monitor|2}}, of about 200 tons displacement. She was captured by the Germans in 1939 and commissioned as ''Bechelaren''. She was extensively rebuilt in 1943 and her armament was also modified in February 1945. She supported German troops during [[Operation_Spring_Awakening|Operation Spring Awakening]] and later fought in Austria, sinking two Soviet gunboats.

Yugoslav river monitors were former Austro-Hungarian warships received as reparations. They were renamed {{ship|Yugoslav monitor|Vardar||2}} (ex-''Bosna''), {{ship|Yugoslav monitor|Sava||2}} (ex-''Bodrog''), {{ship|Yugoslav monitor|Drava||2}} (ex-''Enns'') and ''[[SMS_Körös#Interwar_period_and_World_War_II|Morava]]'' (ex-''Körös''). After the [[Invasion_of_Yugoslavia|fall of Yugoslavia]] in April 1941, ''Morava'' (renamed ''Bosna'') and ''Sava'' were commissioned by the newly created [[Independent_State_of_Croatia|Independent State of Croatia]].

Smaller monitors (70–100 ton displacement) were used by [[Poland|Poland]] in 1939 on the [[Pripyat_River|Pripyat River]] and by the [[Soviet_Union|Soviet Union]] in 1941 on the Pripyat and [[Dnepr|Dnepr]] rivers. The Soviet Union also had five ''Zheleznyakov''-class monitors of 263 tons, which served with the [[Danube_Flotilla_(Soviet_Union)|Danube Flotilla]] and [[Dnieper_Flotilla#The_Dnieper_Flotilla_in_World_War_II|Dnieper Flotilla]] in World War II.

Hungary also used river monitors, five of them notably taking part during the [[Kozara_Offensive|Kozara Offensive]] in 1942.

The Brazilian river monitor {{ship|Brazilian monitor|Parnaíba|U17|2}} was built for the navy in [[Rio_de_Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Ship_commissioning|commissioned]] on 9 March 1938. She participated in the [[Second_World_War|Second World War]] and is currently the world's oldest commissioned warship still in active service.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://warisboring.com/one-of-the-worlds-oldest-military-ships-is-sailing-down-a-river-in-brazil/ |title=One of the World’s Oldest Military Ships Is Sailing Down a River in Brazil |last=Beckhusen |first=Robert |date=25 May 2018 |website=warisboring.com |publisher=Bright Mountain Media |access-date=26 May 2018 |quote=In terms of operational and active ships doing military work, perhaps only the Russian salvage ship ''Kommuna'' is older...}}</ref> She is assigned to the Brazilian navy's [[Mato_Grosso|Mato Grosso]] Flotilla.
