===White Jute (Corchorus capsularis)===

In several historical documents (especially, ''Ain-e-Akbari'' by [[Abu'l-Fazl_ibn_Mubarak|Abul Fazal]] in [[1590|1590]]) during the era of great [[Mughal|Mughal]] [[List_of_Mughal_emperors|Emperor]] [[Akbar|Akbar]] ([[1542|1542]]–[[1605|1605]]) states that the poor villagers of [[India|India]] used to wear cloths made of jute. Simple handlooms and hand spinning wheels were used by the weavers, who used to spin cotton yarns as well. History also states that, Indians, especially [[Bengali_people|Bengalis]] used ropes and twines made of white Jute from ancient times for household and other uses.

==历史==

For centuries, jute has been an integral part of Bengali culture, which is shared by both Bangladesh and West Bengal of [[India|India]]. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, much of the raw jute fibre was exported to the [[United_Kingdom|United Kingdom]], where it was then processed in mills concentrated in [[Dundee|Dundee]] ("jute weaver" was a recognised trade occupation in the [[1901|1901]] UK census), but this trade had largely ceased by about [[1970|1970]] due to the entrance of synthetic fibres.

[[Margaret_Donnelly_I|Margaret Donnelly I]], was a jute mill landowner in Dundee in the 1800s. She set up the first jute mills in India. In the 1950s and 1960s when [[nylon|nylon]] and [[polythene|polythene]] were rarely used, the United [[Pakistan|Pakistan]] (then the world leader in jute products) was earning money through jute of [[East_Pakistan|East Pakistan]], now Bangladesh. It was called the "Golden Fibre of Bangladesh", when it used to bring major portion of the foreign currency reserve for Bangladesh. But, as the use of polythene and other synthetic materials as a substitute for jute started to capture the market, most economists said that jute industry is experiencing a decline.

When the Pakistan and India [[Partition_of_India|became separate countries]] in 1947, the tension rose between these two countries and Pakistan decided to stop exporting jute to the Indian jute mills. The Indian jute industry started to shrink and the Pakistani jute industry started to expand. India then went into jute production, and is currently the largest producer or cultivator of jute.

For several years, farmers in Bangladesh burnt their crops as they did not get an adequate price. Many exporters that were dealing with jute found other commodities in which to deal. The jute-related organisations and government bodies also experienced closures, change, and fund cutting. The long decline in demand forced the largest jute mill in the world ([[Adamjee_Jute_Mills|Adamjee Jute Mills]]) to close. Latif Bawany Jute Mills, the second largest, is still running but was nationalized by the government from prominent businessman, Yahya Bawany. But the farmers of Bangladesh surprisingly did not stop growing jute, mainly due to demand in the internal market. Recently (2004–2006), the jute market turned back again and the price of raw jute increased more than 50% due to high demand of jute products worldwide.

During [[1941|1941]], [[Henry_Ford|Henry Ford]] tested the strength of a car trunk made from [[soybean|soybean]] fibre. The trunk was made of [[soy_protein|soy-protein]] [[plastic|plastic]] reinforced with [[Glass_Fiber|glass]], which was stronger, lighter, and more flexible than conventional car panels. This experiment revolutionised the use of natural fibres in the [[Automaker|automobile industry]] and made cars lighter, which in turn made them more [[Fuel_economy_in_automobiles|fuel efficient]]. The previously used glass fibre proved to be very heavy and emitted poisonous gas when burnt. Therefore, most people died of poisonous gas inhalation, not by wounds during car accidents. This fact has driven the [[European_Union|European Union]] to ban the use of glass fibre in automobiles. When Henry Ford's experiment gained huge response, the automobile companies started to search for other bast fibres, as soybean fibre had problems in moulding. They found that flax was the best bast fibre for the automobile interior production.

It has been shown that flax, jute, and hemp fibres contain characteristics such as [[ductility|ductile]] structure and stiffness per unit of weight that result in benefits during side impacts. But, jute was recognised as the next to the best at a quite late time. In some cases, jute has become the better option than flax in producing car interiors. Moreover, jute proved to be the most cost effective fibre in this sector, as jute is the cheapest vegetable fibre with very high [[tensile_strength|tensile strength]]. However, there are contrasting information regarding this history. Other uses for natural fibres now includes composite production of sheet moulding compound, resin transfer moulding, and vacuum pressing techniques and injection.

Jute has entered various diversified sectors, where natural fibres are gradually becoming better substitution. Among these industries are [[paper|paper]], [[cellulose|celluloid]] products (films), [[nonwovens|non-woven textiles]], [[Composite_material|composites]] ([[pseudo-wood|pseudo-wood]]), and [[geotextile|geotextile]]s. -->

== 用途 ==

[[File:Jute_matting.jpg|thumb]]

*黄麻是重要性仅次于棉花的植物纤维；拥有多种用途。首先是用于原棉打包的包装運輸袋，其次是制成袋子或粗布，还可以织成[[窗帘|窗帘]]、椅套、[[地毯|地毯]]、粗麻布和油布的衬背，更可以當作造紙原料。
*黃麻桿也可當作燃料、活性碳、纖維版等，可以取代伐木工業的部分性質。
*在[[台灣中部|台灣中部]]地方把圓果黃麻改良品種的幼葉在水中搓洗出苦汁並加入[[地瓜|地瓜]]和[[吻仔魚|吻仔魚]]煮成湯，稱之為[[麻薏|麻薏]]湯。

<!-- While jute is being replaced by synthetic materials in many of these uses, some uses take advantage of jute's [[Biodegradation|biodegradable]] nature, where synthetics would be unsuitable. Examples of such uses include containers for planting young trees which can be planted directly with the container without disturbing the roots, and land restoration where jute cloth prevents erosion occurring while natural vegetation becomes established.

The fibres are used alone or blended with other types of fibres to make [[twine|twine]] and [[rope|rope]]. Jute butts, the coarse ends of the plants, are used to make inexpensive cloth. Conversely, very fine threads of jute can be separated out and made into ''imitation silk''. As jute fibres are also being used to make pulp and paper, and with increasing concern over forest destruction for the [[wood_pulp|wood pulp]] used to make most paper, the importance of jute for this purpose may increase. Jute has a long history of use in the sackings, carpets, wrapping fabrics (cotton bale), and construction fabric manufacturing industry.

Traditionally jute was used in traditional textile machineries as textile fibres having cellulose (vegetable fibre content) and [[lignin|lignin]] (wood fibre content). But, the major breakthrough came when the automobile, pulp and paper, and the furniture and bedding industries started to use jute and its allied fibres with their non-woven and composite technology to manufacture nonwovens, [[technical_textiles|technical textiles]], and composites. Therefore, jute has changed its textile fibre outlook and steadily heading towards its newer identity, i.e. wood fibre. As a textile fibre, jute has reached its peak from where there is no hope of progress, but as a wood fibre jute has many promising features <ref>The Golden Fibre Trade Centre Limited.

Geotextiles are another area that made this agricultural commodity more popular in the agricultural sector. It is a lightly woven fabric made from natural fibres that is used for soil erosion control, seed protection, weed control, and many other agricultural and [[landscaping|landscaping]] uses. The geotextiles can be used more than a year and the bio-degradable jute geotextile left to rot on the ground keeps the ground cool and is able to make the land more fertile. Methods such as this could be used to transfer the fertility of the [Ganges Delta to the deserts of [[Sahara|Sahara]] or [[Australia|Australia]] {{Fact|date=February 2007}}.

Moreover, jute can be grown in 4–6 months with a huge amount of cellulose being produced from the jute hurd (inner woody core or [[parenchyma|parenchyma]] of the jute stem) that can meet most of the wood needs of the world. Jute is the major crop among others that is able to protect deforestation by industrialisation.

Thus, jute is the most environment-friendly fibre starting from the seed to expired fibre, as the expired fibres can be recycled more than once.

Diversified byproducts which can be cultivated from jute include uses in food, cosmetics, medicine, paints, and other products. Jute leaves is also a popular vegetable in [[West_Africa|West Africa]]. The [[Yoruba_people|Yoruba]] of [[Nigeria|Nigeria]] call it "ewedu". It is made into a common slimy soup in some West African cooking traditions. -->

== 特征 ==

* 黄麻纤维可以100%进行生物分解和回收，对环境无害。
* 它是一种拥有黄金和丝绸光泽的天然纤维，因而被称为“金色纤维”。
* 它是最便宜的植物纤维，取自植物的茎的内皮或外皮。
* 它在使用、全球消费量、生产和实用方面的重要性仅次于棉花的植物纤维。
* 它的抗张强度很高，延展性低，防水性能较好。因此，黄麻非常适合于大批量农产品的包装。
<!-- 

* It helps to make best quality industrial yarn, fabric, net, and sacks. It is one of the most versatile natural fibres that has been used in raw materials for packaging, textiles, non-textile, construction, and agricultural sectors. Bulking of [[yarn|yarn]] results in a reduced breaking tenacity and an increased breaking extensibility when blended as a ternary blend.
* The jute plant is derived from a relative of the hemp ([[Cannabis|Cannabis]]) plant. However, jute is totally free from [[Psychoactive_drug|narcotic]] elements or odour.
* The best source of jute in the world is the Bengal Delta Plain in the Ganges Delta, most of which is occupied by Bangladesh.
* Advantages of jute include good insulating and [[static_electricity|antistatic]] properties, as well as having low [[thermal_conductivity|thermal conductivity]] and a moderate [[moisture_regain|moisture regain]]. Other advantages of jute include [[Soundproofing|acoustic insulating]] properties and manufacture with no [[Irritation|skin irritations]]. -->

<!-- * Jute has the ability to be blended with other fibres, both synthetic and natural, and accepts cellulosic [[dye|dye]] classes such as [[natural_dye|natural]], [[basic_dye|basic]], [[vat_dye|vat]], [[Sulfur_dye|sulfur]], [[reactive_dye|reactive]], and [[pigment_dye|pigment dye]]s. As the demand for natural comfort fibres increases, the demand for jute and other natural fibres that can be blended with cotton will increase. To meet this demand, it has been suggested that the natural fibre industry adopt the [[Rieter|Rieter's]] [[Elitex|Elitex]] system, in order to modernize processing. The resulting jute/cotton yarns will produce fabrics with a reduced cost of wet processing treatments. Jute can also be blended with wool. By treating jute with [[caustic_soda|caustic soda]], crimp, softness, pliability, and appearance is improved, aiding in its ability to be spun with wool. Liquid [[ammonia|ammonia]] has a similar effect on jute, as well as the added characteristic of improving flame resistance when treated with [[fireproofing|flameproofing]] agents. -->

<!-- * Some noted disadvantages include poor drapability and crease resistance, [[brittleness|brittleness]], fibre shedding, and yellowing in sunlight. However, preparation of fabrics with [[castor_oil|castor oil]] [[lubricant|lubricant]]s result in less yellowing and less fabric weight loss, as well as increased dyeing brilliance. Jute has a decreased strength when wet, and also becomes subject to [[Microorganism|microbial]] attack in humid climates. Jute can be processed with an [[enzyme|enzyme]] in order to reduce some of its brittleness and stiffness. Once treated with an enzyme, jute shows an affinity to readily accept natural dyes, which can be made from [[Asteraceae|marigold]] flower extract. In one attempt to dye jute fabric with this extract, bleached fabric was [[mordant|mordant]]ed with [[Iron(II)_sulfate|ferrous sulphate]], increasing the fabric's dye uptake value. Jute also responds well to [[reactive_dye|reactive dye]]ing. This process is used for bright and fast coloured value-added diversified products made from jute. -->
