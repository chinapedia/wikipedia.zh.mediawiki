'''刻板印象'''（亦稱'''印刻作用'''，{{lang-en|stereotype}}），是一個[[社會學|社會學]][[術語|術語]]，專指[[人類|人類]]對於某些特定類型人、事或物的一種概括的看法，看法可能是來自於同一類型的人事物之中的某一個個體給旁人的觀感。刻板印象有分為正面以及負面的觀感有[[先入為主|先入為主]]的觀念，並不能夠代表每個屬於這個類型的人事物都擁有這樣的特質；每個人從小教育的觀念以及生長環境也會影響人的觀念，當遇到類似獲相同的事情則會以自己的經歷反映在某件事上，而造成意見有落差形成的刻板印象，不過另一方面，雖然有一個對49個文化進行的研究顯示，民族性這種族群刻板印象，並不反映該社會成員的平均人格特質<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775052/</ref>，但刻板印象有可能是準確的，一項研究顯示，一些種類的刻板印象有著中至高度的準確性<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://psyarxiv.com/beaq3/ |title=存档副本 |accessdate=2018-07-24 |archive-date=2020-12-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201219023911/https://psyarxiv.com/beaq3/ |dead-url=no }}</ref>，而且一些研究和後續的研究，可能會一再證實某些刻板印象的準確性<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.spsp.org/news-center/blog/stereotype-accuracy-response |title=存档副本 |accessdate=2018-07-24 |archive-date=2020-11-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201121015022/https://www.spsp.org/news-center/blog/stereotype-accuracy-response |dead-url=no }}</ref>。

== 概說 ==
刻板印象的來源大多是因為個人沒有足夠的時間去了解某個個體所致。例如說當我們看到長得魁梧、紋身，戴黑色[[太陽眼鏡|太陽眼鏡]]、臉孔嚇人且穿著黑西裝的壯漢，很可能會將他誤認為[[黑社會|黑社會]]人物。又例如某[[電影|電影]]中，[[主角|主角]]是一般社會大眾印象下的壞人，則判定該電影為「歌頌罪惡」的影片。刻板印象愛好者容易先把世事標籤化分類，再加以對目標物的種種現象[[歸納|歸納]]，支持其原先的刻板印象。例如一位正義英雄型人物因醉酒與自己伴侶以外的女性發生[[性行為|性行為]]，令對方[[懷孕|懷孕]]並誕下[[私生子|私生子]]，應該是遭「奸人所害」。

刻板印象常常是相對負面的，不過刻板印象並非全是負面的，有些刻板印象是正面的，正面的刻板印象即所謂的「[[正面刻板印象|正面刻板印象]]」（Positive stereotype）。正面刻板印象可能造成正面或負面的影響。<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Czopp|first=Alexander M.|last2=Kay|first2=Aaron C.|last3=Cheryan|first3=Sapna|date=2015-07-01|title=Positive Stereotypes Are Pervasive and Powerful|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|language=en|volume=10|issue=4|pages=451–463|doi=10.1177/1745691615588091|issn=1745-6916|pmid=26177947}}</ref>

刻板印象一旦形成，若不客觀理解，則很難加以改變，亦可能造成同類型人的困擾，即使是正面的刻板印象，如「亞洲人數理強」、「[[亞斯伯格症|亞斯伯格症]]患者很擅長且適合搞[[電腦程式|電腦程式]]」等，都可能對當事人造成困擾和負面影響。<ref name=":0" />不過，出色的[[公共關係|公共關係]]手法，可以改善當事人原先給標籤的刻板印象，創造出第二印象，[[社會心理學|社會心理學]]又稱之為「最後印象」，例如一位[[富翁|富翁]]一生對人對己都「節儉」，意想不到原來[[遺囑|遺囑]]指定，將[[遺產|遺產]]全數捐贈作慈善，感動了法官。

刻板印象在某些[[專制|專制]]社會、或[[民主制度|民主制度]]較不發達的國家也容易為有心的政治人物、政黨、或他們的支持者所利用，例如透過各種管道（[[媒體|媒體]]、[[文宣|文宣]]等）普遍散佈敵對政治陣營的負面形象，或刻意宣揚有利於己身立場的事件，以便塑造本身陣營的正面刻板形象或敵方的負面刻板印象。{{OR}}

刻板印象在我們的生活中，表示於部分的、片面的、不正常的、不完全的。然而刻板印象代表[[內團體|內團體]](小圈子)對[[外團體|外團體]](其他團體)成員的普遍化概論。


==外顯性==
===外顯的刻板印象===
外顯的刻板印象指的是人們有所認知且用以論斷他人的刻板印象，如果今天某甲對屬於某團體的某乙做出論斷，而某甲對於那團體有著一定的成見，那他多少能用有意識的控制來調和自己的決策偏見；然而，有意識地嘗試改變因偏見而形成的刻板印象、以達成不偏私的努力常會失敗，而這是因為人們常會低估或高估因為刻板印象而形成的偏見所致。

===內隱的刻板印象===
內隱的刻板印象指的是存在於一個人潛意識中、未被察覺到、不受控制的刻板印象。<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/faqs.html#faq1|title=Frequently Asked Questions|website=implicit.harvard.edu|access-date=14 April 2018|archive-date=2019-03-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190325230619/https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/faqs.html#faq1}}</ref>

在社會心理學中，刻板印象指的是關於某類人或行為、且廣泛受認可的任何想法，而這種想法出現的目的，是為了要對這類人或行為所組成的群體給出一個作為整體的代表所致；<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al.

By contrast, a newer [[Stereotype_content_model|model of stereotype content]] theorizes that stereotypes are frequently ambivalent and vary along two dimensions: warmth and competence. Warmth and competence are respectively predicted by lack of [[competition|competition]] and [[Social_status|status]]. Groups that do not compete with the in-group for the same resources (e.g., college space) are perceived as warm, whereas high-status (e.g., economically or educationally successful) groups are considered competent.

Early studies suggested that stereotypes were only used by rigid, repressed, and authoritarian people. This idea has been refuted by contemporary studies that suggest the ubiquity of stereotypes and it was suggested to regard stereotypes as collective group beliefs, meaning that people who belong to the same social group share the same set of stereotypes.<ref name="Tajfel (1981)">{{cite book |last1= Tajfel |first1= Henri |editor1-first= John C. |editor1-last= Turner |editor2-first= Howard |editor2-last= Giles |title= Intergroup behaviour |year= 1981 |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell|Blackwell]] |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-631-11711-7 |pages= 144–167 |chapter= Social stereotypes and social groups }}</ref> Modern research asserts that full understanding of stereotypes requires considering them from two complementary perspectives: as shared within a particular culture/subculture and as formed in the mind of an individual person.<ref>Macrae CN, Stangor C, Hewstone M.

===認知與社會功能間的關係===
Stereotyping can serve cognitive functions on an interpersonal level, and social functions on an intergroup level.<ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"/><ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/> For stereotyping to function on an intergroup level (see social identity approaches: [[social_identity_theory|social identity theory]] and [[self-categorization_theory|self-categorization theory]]), an individual must see themselves as part of a group and being part of that group must also be salient for the individual.<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/>

Craig McGarty, Russell Spears, and Vincent Y. Yzerbyt (2002) argued that the cognitive functions of stereotyping are best understood in relation to its social functions, and vice versa.<ref name="McGarty Spears et al. (2002)">{{cite book |last1= McGarty |first1= Craig |last3= Yzerbyt |first3= Vincent Y. |last2= Spears | first2= Russel |title= Stereotypes as explanations: The formation of meaningful beliefs about social groups |url= https://archive.org/details/stereotypesasexp00mcga |url-access= limited |year= 2002 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge |isbn= 978-0-521-80047-1 |pages= [https://archive.org/details/stereotypesasexp00mcga/page/n197 186]–199|chapter= Conclusion: stereotypes are selective, variable and contested explanations }}</ref>

===認知功能===
Stereotypes can help make sense of the world. They are a form of categorization that helps to simplify and systematize information. Thus, information is more easily identified, recalled, predicted, and reacted to.<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/> Stereotypes are categories of objects or people. Between stereotypes, objects or people are as different from each other as possible.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/> Within stereotypes, objects or people are as similar to each other as possible.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/>

[[Gordon_Allport|Gordon Allport]] has suggested possible answers to why people find it easier to understand categorized information.<ref name="Allport (1954)">{{cite book |title= The Nature of Prejudice |last= Allport |first= Gordon W. |author-link= Gordon Allport |year= 1954 |publisher= [[Addison-Wesley|Addison-Wesley]] |location= Cambridge, MA |isbn= 978-0-201-00175-4 |page= [https://archive.org/details/natureofprejudic00gord/page/189 189] |url=https://archive.org/details/natureofprejudic00gord|url-access= registration }}</ref> First, people can consult a category to identify response patterns. Second, categorized information is more specific than non-categorized information, as categorization accentuates properties that are shared by all members of a group. Third, people can readily describe objects in a category because objects in the same category have distinct characteristics. Finally, people can take for granted the characteristics of a particular category because the category itself may be an arbitrary grouping.

A complementary perspective theorizes how stereotypes function as time- and energy-savers that allow people to act more efficiently.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/> Yet another perspective suggests that stereotypes are people's biased perceptions of their social contexts.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/> In this view, people use stereotypes as shortcuts to make sense of their social contexts, and this makes a person's task of understanding his or her world less cognitively demanding.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/>

====社會分類====
In the following situations, the overarching purpose of stereotyping is for people to put their collective self (their in-group membership) in a positive light:<ref name="Haslam et al.

* when stereotypes are used for explaining social events
* when stereotypes are used for justifying activities of one's own group ([[ingroups_and_outgroups|ingroup]]) to another group ([[ingroups_and_outgroups|outgroup]])
* when stereotypes are used for differentiating the ingroup as positively distinct from outgroups

=====解釋目的=====
[[File:Antisemitic_caricature_1873.jpg|thumb]] 1873 caricature depicting the stereotypical physical features of a Jewish male.]]

As mentioned previously, stereotypes can be used to explain social events.<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/><ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/> [[Henri_Tajfel|Henri Tajfel]]<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/> described his observations of how some people found that the anti-Semitic fabricated contents of [[The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion|The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]] only made sense if Jews have certain characteristics. Therefore, according to Tajfel,<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/> Jews were stereotyped as being evil and yearning for world domination to match the anti-Semitic "facts" as presented in The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.

=====合理化目的=====
People create stereotypes of an outgroup to justify the actions that their in-group has committed (or plans to commit) towards that outgroup.<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/><ref name="Allport (1954)"/><ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/> For example, according to Tajfel,<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/> Europeans stereotyped African, Indian, and Chinese people as being incapable of achieving financial advances without European help. This stereotype was used to justify European colonialism in Africa, India, and China.

=====區別不同族群=====
An assumption is that people want their ingroup to have a positive image relative to outgroups, and so people want to differentiate their ingroup from relevant outgroups in a desirable way.<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/> If an outgroup does not affect the ingroup's image, then from an image preservation point of view, there is no point for the ingroup to be positively distinct from that outgroup.<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/>

People can actively create certain images for relevant outgroups by stereotyping. People do so when they see that their ingroup is no longer as clearly and/or as positively differentiated from relevant outgroups, and they want to restore the intergroup differentiation to a state that favours the ingroup.<ref name="Tajfel (1981)"/><ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/>

Stereotypes can emphasize a person's group membership in two steps: Stereotypes emphasize the person's similarities with ingroup members on relevant dimensions, and also the person's differences from outgroup members on relevant dimensions.<ref name=":1" /> People change the stereotype of their ingroups and outgroups to suit context.<ref name=":1" /> Once an outgroup treats an ingroup member badly, they are more drawn to the members of their own group.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1080/15298868.2012.712753 | volume=12 | title=Comparing Self-stereotyping with In-group-stereotyping and Out-group-stereotyping in Unequal-status Groups: The Case of Gender | year=2013 | journal=Self and Identity | pages=582–596 | last1 = Cadinu | first1 = Mara | last2 = Latrofa | first2 = Marcella | last3 = Carnaghi | first3 = Andrea| issue=6 | s2cid=145053003 }}</ref> This can be seen as members within a group are able to relate to each other though a stereotype because of identical situations.

Stereotypes are an indicator of ingroup consensus.<ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/> When there are intragroup disagreements over stereotypes of the ingroup and/or outgroups, ingroup members take collective action to prevent other ingroup members from diverging from each other.<ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/>

John C. Turner proposed in 1987<ref name="Haslam et al. (2002)"/> that if ingroup members disagree on an outgroup stereotype, then one of three possible collective actions follow: First, ingroup members may negotiate with each other and conclude that they have different outgroup stereotypes because they are stereotyping different subgroups of an outgroup (e.g., Russian gymnasts versus Russian boxers). Second, ingroup members may negotiate with each other, but conclude that they are disagreeing because of categorical differences amongst themselves. Accordingly, in this context, it is better to categorise ingroup members under different categories (e.g., Democrats versus Republican) than under a shared category (e.g., American). Finally, ingroup members may influence each other to arrive at a common outgroup stereotype.

Different disciplines give different accounts of how stereotypes develop: Psychologists may focus on an individual's experience with groups, patterns of communication about those groups, and intergroup conflict. As for sociologists, they may focus on the relations among different groups in a social structure. They suggest that stereotypes are the result of conflict, poor parenting, and inadequate mental and emotional development. Once stereotypes have formed, there are two main factors that explain their persistence. First, the cognitive effects of schematic processing (see [[schema_(psychology)|schema]]) make it so that when a member of a group behaves as we expect, the behavior confirms and even strengthens existing stereotypes. Second, the affective or emotional aspects of prejudice render logical arguments against stereotypes ineffective in countering the power of emotional responses.<ref>Aronson, E., Wilson, T.

===Correspondence bias===
{{Main|Correspondence bias}}
''Correspondence bias'' refers to the tendency to ascribe a person's behavior to [[disposition|disposition]] or personality, and to underestimate the extent to which situational factors elicited the behavior. Correspondence bias can play an important role in stereotype formation.<ref>{{Cite book |last1= Mackie |first1= Diane M. |last2= Hamilton |first2= David L. |last3= Susskind |first3= Joshua |last4= Rosselli |first4= Francine |editor1-first= C.

For example, in a study by Roguer and Yzerbyt (1999) participants watched a video showing students who were randomly instructed to find arguments either for or against [[euthanasia|euthanasia]]. The students that argued in favor of euthanasia came from the same law department or from different departments. Results showed that participants attributed the students' responses to their attitudes although it had been made clear in the video that students had no choice about their position. Participants reported that group membership, i.e., the department that the students belonged to, affected the students' opinions about euthanasia. Law students were perceived to be more in favor of euthanasia than students from different departments despite the fact that a pretest had revealed that subjects had no preexisting expectations about attitudes toward euthanasia and the department that students belong to. The attribution error created the new stereotype that law students are more likely to support euthanasia.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Rogier |first1= Anouk |last2= Yzerbyt |first2= Vincent |title= Social attribution, correspondence bias, and the emergence of stereotypes |year= 1999 |journal= Swiss Journal of Psychology |volume= 58 |issue= 4 |pages= 233–240 |doi= 10.1024//1421-0185.58.4.233 |url= http://www.psor.ucl.ac.be/personal/yzerbyt/Rogier%20&%20Yzerbyt%20SJP%201999.pdf |access-date= 5 April 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130729071003/http://www.psor.ucl.ac.be/personal/yzerbyt/Rogier%20%26%20Yzerbyt%20SJP%201999.pdf |archive-date= 29 July 2013 |url-status= dead}}</ref>

Nier et al. (2012) found that people who tend to draw dispositional inferences from behavior and ignore situational constraints are more likely to stereotype low-status groups as incompetent and high-status groups as competent. Participants listened to descriptions of two fictitious groups of [[Pacific_Islander|Pacific Islander]]s, one of which was described as being higher in status than the other. In a second study, subjects rated actual groups – the poor and wealthy, women and men – in the United States in terms of their competence. Subjects who scored high on the measure of correspondence bias stereotyped the poor, women, and the fictitious lower-status Pacific Islanders as incompetent whereas they stereotyped the wealthy, men, and the high-status Pacific Islanders as competent. The correspondence bias was a significant predictor of stereotyping even after controlling for other measures that have been linked to beliefs about low status groups, the [[just-world_hypothesis|just-world hypothesis]] and [[social_dominance_orientation|social dominance orientation]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1= Nier |first1= Jason A. |last2= Bajaj |first2= Priya |last3= McLean |first3= Meghan C. |last4= Schwartz |first4= Elizabeth |title= Group status, perceptions of agency, and the correspondence bias: Attributional processes in the formation of stereotypes about high and low status groups |year= 2012 |journal= [[Group_Processes_&_Intergroup_Relations|Group Processes & Intergroup Relations]] |volume= 16|issue= 4|pages= 1–12 |doi= 10.1177/1368430212454925 |s2cid= 145399213 }}</ref>

They build on the assumption that the [[Red_tape|red-tape]] and bureaucratic nature of the public sector spills over in the perception that citizens have about the employees working in the sector. With an experimental vignette study, they analyze how citizens process information on employees' sector affiliation, and integrate non-work role-referencing to test the stereotype confirmation assumption underlying the [[representativeness_heuristic|representativeness heuristic]]. The results show that sector as well as non-work role-referencing influences perceived employee professionalism but has little effect on the confirmation of particular public sector stereotypes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Willems|first=Jurgen|date=2020|title=Public servant stereotypes: It is not (at) all about being lazy, greedy and corrupt|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/padm.12686|journal=Public Administration|language=en|volume=98|issue=4|pages=807–823|doi=10.1111/padm.12686|s2cid=221760839|issn=1467-9299}}</ref> Moreover, the results do not confirm a congruity effect of consistent stereotypical information: non-work role-referencing does not aggravate the negative effect of sector affiliation on perceived employee professionalism.

===Illusory correlation===
{{main|Illusory correlation}}
Research has shown that stereotypes can develop based on a cognitive mechanism known as illusory correlation – an erroneous inference about the relationship between two events.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al.

In the intergroup context, illusory correlations lead people to misattribute rare behaviors or traits at higher rates to [[minority_group|minority group]] members than to majority groups, even when both display the same proportion of the behaviors or traits. [[Black_people|Black people]], for instance, are a minority group in the [[United_States|United States]] and interaction with blacks is a relatively infrequent event for an average [[white_American|white American]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ajrouch|first1=Kristine J.|last2=Antonucci|first2=Toni C.|last3=Janevic|first3=Mary R.|date=1 March 2001|title=Social Networks Among Blacks and Whites: The Interaction Between Race and Age|journal=The Journals of Gerontology|volume=56|issue=2|pages=S112–S118|doi=10.1093/geronb/56.2.S112|pmid=11245365|doi-access=free}}</ref> Similarly, undesirable behavior (e.g. [[crime|crime]]) is statistically less frequent than desirable behavior. Since both events "blackness" and "undesirable behavior" are distinctive in the sense that they are infrequent, the combination of the two leads observers to overestimate the rate of co-occurrence.<ref name="hamilton&gifford"/> Similarly, in workplaces where women are underrepresented and negative behaviors such as errors occur less frequently than positive behaviors, women become more strongly associated with mistakes than men.<ref>{{cite book |last1= Moskowitz |first1= Gordon B. |author-link1= Gordon Moskowitz |title= Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others |url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&pg=PA182 |year= 2005 |publisher= [[Guilford_Press|Guilford Press]] |location= New York |isbn= 978-1-59385-085-2 |page= 182 }}</ref>

In a landmark study, David Hamilton and Richard Gifford (1976) examined the role of illusory correlation in stereotype formation. Subjects were instructed to read descriptions of behaviors performed by members of groups A and B. Negative behaviors outnumbered positive actions and group B was smaller than group A, making negative behaviors and membership in group B relatively infrequent and distinctive. Participants were then asked who had performed a set of actions: a person of group A or group B. Results showed that subjects overestimated the frequency with which both distinctive events, membership in group B and negative behavior, co-occurred, and evaluated group B more negatively. This despite the fact the proportion of positive to negative behaviors was equivalent for both groups and that there was no actual correlation between group membership and behaviors.<ref name="hamilton&gifford"/> Although Hamilton and Gifford found a similar effect for positive behaviors as the infrequent events, a [[Meta-analysis|meta-analytic]] review of studies showed that illusory correlation effects are stronger when the infrequent, distinctive information is negative.<ref name="mullen&johnson"/>

Hamilton and Gifford's distinctiveness-based explanation of stereotype formation was subsequently extended.<ref name="Berndsen et al. (2002)"/> A 1994 study by McConnell, Sherman, and Hamilton found that people formed stereotypes based on information that was not distinctive at the time of presentation, but was considered distinctive at the time of judgement.<ref name="McConnell et al. (1994)"/> Once a person judges non-distinctive information in memory to be distinctive, that information is re-encoded and re-represented as if it had been distinctive when it was first processed.<ref name="McConnell et al. (1994)"/>

===Common environment===
One explanation for why stereotypes are shared is that they are the result of a common environment that stimulates people to react in the same way.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/>

The problem with the 'common environment' is that explanation in general is that it does not explain how shared stereotypes can occur without direct stimuli.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/> Research since the 1930s suggested that people are highly similar with each other in how they describe different racial and national groups, although those people have no personal experience with the groups they are describing.<ref name="Katz & Braly (1933)"/>

===Socialization and upbringing===
Another explanation says that people are [[Socialisation|socialised]] to adopt the same stereotypes.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/> Some psychologists believe that although stereotypes can be absorbed at any age, stereotypes are usually acquired in early childhood under the influence of parents, teachers, peers, and the media.

If stereotypes are defined by social values, then stereotypes only change as per changes in social values.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/> The suggestion that stereotype content depends on social values reflects [[Walter_Lippman|Walter Lippman]]'s argument in his 1922 publication that stereotypes are rigid because they cannot be changed at will.<ref name="Katz & Braly (1935)"/>

Studies emerging since the 1940s refuted the suggestion that stereotype contents cannot be changed at will. Those studies suggested that one group's stereotype of another group would become more or less positive depending on whether their [[intergroup_relations|intergroup relations]]hip had improved or degraded.<ref name="Katz & Braly (1935)"/><ref name="Meenes (1943)">{{cite journal |last1= Meenes |first1= Max |year= 1943 |title= A Comparison of Racial Stereotypes of 1935 and 1942 |journal= [[Journal_of_Social_Psychology|Journal of Social Psychology]] |volume= 17 |issue= 2 |pages= 327–336 |doi= 10.1080/00224545.1943.9712287 }}</ref><ref name="Haslam et al.

(1994)">Oakes, P. J., Haslam, S. A., & Turner, J. C. (1994). Stereotyping and social reality. Oxford: Blackwell.</ref>

===Intergroup relations===
According to a third explanation, shared stereotypes are neither caused by the coincidence of common stimuli, nor by socialisation. This explanation posits that stereotypes are shared because group members are motivated to behave in certain ways, and stereotypes reflect those behaviours.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/> It is important to note from this explanation that stereotypes are the consequence, not the cause, of [[intergroup_relations|intergroup relations]]. This explanation assumes that when it is important for people to acknowledge both their ingroup and outgroup, they will emphasise their difference from outgroup members, and their similarity to ingroup members.<ref name="McGarty Yzerbyt et al. (2002)"/> International migration creates more opportunities for intergroup relations, but the interactions do not always disconfirm stereotypes. They are also known to form and maintain them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Palmer|first=Wayne|year=2019|title=International Migration and Stereotype Formation: Indonesian Migrants in Hong Kong|journal=Journal of International Migration and Integration|language=en|volume=21|issue=3|pages=731–744|doi=10.1007/s12134-019-00680-1|s2cid=195363006|issn=1488-3473}}</ref>

The dual-process model of cognitive processing of stereotypes asserts that automatic activation of stereotypes is followed by a controlled processing stage, during which an individual may choose to disregard or ignore the stereotyped information that has been brought to mind.<ref name="faculty.washington.edu"/>

A number of studies have found that stereotypes are activated automatically. [[Patricia_Devine|Patricia Devine]] (1989), for example, suggested that stereotypes are automatically activated in the presence of a member (or some symbolic equivalent) of a stereotyped group and that the unintentional activation of the stereotype is equally strong for high- and low-prejudice persons. Words related to the cultural stereotype of blacks were presented [[Subliminal_stimuli|subliminally]]. During an ostensibly unrelated [[Impression_formation|impression-formation]] task, subjects read a paragraph describing a race-unspecified target person's behaviors and rated the target person on several trait scales. Results showed that participants who received a high proportion of racial words rated the target person in the story as significantly more hostile than participants who were presented with a lower proportion of words related to the stereotype. This effect held true for both high- and low-prejudice subjects (as measured by the Modern Racism Scale). Thus, the racial stereotype was activated even for low-prejudice individuals who did not personally endorse it.<ref name="faculty.washington.edu"/><ref>{{cite book |last1= Devine |first= Patricia G. |last2= Monteith |first2= Margo J. |editor1-first= Shelly |editor1-last= Chaiken |editor2-first= Yaacov |editor2-last= Trope |title= Dual-Process Theories in Social Psychology |year= 1999 |publisher= Guilford Press |location= New York |isbn= 978-1-57230-421-5 |pages= 341–342 |chapter= Automaticty and Control in Stereotyping |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5X_auIBx99EC&pg=PA341}}</ref><ref name="Bargh 1994">{{cite book |last1= Bargh |first= John A. |author-link1= John Bargh |editor1-first= Robert S. |editor1-last= Wyer |editor2-first= Thomas K. |editor2-last= Srull |title= Handbook of Social Cognition |edition= 2nd |volume= Two |year= 1994 |publisher= Lawrence Earlbaum |location= Hillsdale, NJ |isbn= 978-0-8058-1056-1 |page= [https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780805810578/page/21 21] |chapter= The Four Horsemen of Automaticity: Awareness, Intention, Efficiency, Control in Social Cognition |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5ncW0DyNqVwC&pg=PA21 |url= https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780805810578/page/21 }}</ref> Studies using alternative priming methods have shown that the activation of gender and age stereotypes can also be automatic.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Banaji |first1= Mahzarin R. |last2= Hardin |first2= Curtis D. |year= 1996 |title= Automatic Stereotyping |journal= [[Psychological_Science_(journal)|Psychological Science]] |volume= 7 |issue= 3 |pages= 136–141 |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00346.x |s2cid= 207858486 |url= http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~mrbworks/articles/1996_PsySci.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Perdue |first1= Charles W. |last2= Gurtman |first2= Michael B. |year= 1990 |title= Evidence for the automaticity of ageism |journal= Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume= 26 |issue= 3 |pages= 199–216 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1031(90)90035-K }}</ref>

They argued that if only the neutral category labels were presented, people high and low in prejudice would respond differently. In a design similar to Devine's, Lepore and Brown [[Priming_(psychology)|primed]] the category of African-Americans using labels such as "blacks" and "West Indians" and then assessed the differential activation of the associated stereotype in the subsequent impression-formation task. They found that high-prejudice participants increased their ratings of the target person on the negative stereotypic dimensions and decreased them on the positive dimension whereas low-prejudice subjects tended in the opposite direction. The results suggest that the level of prejudice and stereotype endorsement affects people's judgements when the category – and not the stereotype per se – is primed.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Lepore |first1= Lorella |last2= Brown |first2= Rupert |year= 1997 |title= Category and Stereotype Activation: Is Prejudice Inevitable? |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 72 |issue= 2 |pages= 275–287 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.72.2.275 |url= http://www.atkinson.yorku.ca/~jsteele/PDF/Optional%20Readings/Lepore_Brown_JPSP_1997.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191944/http://www.atkinson.yorku.ca/~jsteele/PDF/Optional%20Readings/Lepore_Brown_JPSP_1997.pdf |archive-date= 2 January 2014 |url-status= dead}}</ref>

Research has shown that people can be trained to activate [[Counterstereotype|counterstereotypic]] information and thereby reduce the automatic activation of negative stereotypes.

===Attributional ambiguity===
{{main|Attributional ambiguity}}
Attributive ambiguity refers to the uncertainty that members of stereotyped groups experience in interpreting the causes of others' behavior toward them. Stereotyped individuals who receive negative [[feedback|feedback]] can [[Attribution_(psychology)|attribute]] it either to personal shortcomings, such as lack of ability or poor effort, or the evaluator's stereotypes and prejudice toward their social group. Alternatively, positive feedback can either be attributed to personal merit or discounted as a form of [[sympathy|sympathy]] or [[pity|pity]].<ref name="zemore-fiske-kim">{{cite book |last1= Zemore |first1= Sarah E. |last2= Fiske |first2= Susan T. |last3= Kim |first3= Hyun-Jeong |editor1-first= Thomas |editor1-last= Eckes |editor2-first= Hanns Martin |editor2-last= Trautner |title= The Developmental Social Psychology of Gender |year= 2000 |publisher= Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location= Mahwah, NJ |isbn= 978-0-585-30065-8 |pages=229–230 |chapter= Gender Stereotypes and the Dynamics of Social Interaction |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yJ43_5tJGycC&pg=PA229 }}</ref><ref name="crocker-major-steele">{{cite book |last1= Crocker |first1= Jennifer |last2= Major |first2= Brenda |last3= Stelle |first3= Claude |editor1-first= Daniel T. |editor1-last= Gilbert |editor2-first= Susan T. |editor2-last= Fiske |editor3-first= Gardner |editor3-last= Lindzey |title= The Handbook of Social Psychology |edition= 4th |volume= Two |year= 1998 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-521376-8 |pages= 519–521 |chapter= Social Stigma |chapter-url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w27pSuHLnLYC&pg=PA519 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1= Whiteley |first1= Bernard E. |last2= Kite |first2= Mary E. |title= The Psychology of Prejudice and Discrimination |url=  https://books.google.com/books?id=mXSJEjl4uZYC&pg=PA428 |edition= 2nd |year= 2010 |publisher= Wadsworth Cengage Learning |location= Belmont, CA |isbn= 978-0-495-59964-7 |pages= 428–435 }}</ref>

[[Jennifer_Crocker|Crocker]] et al. (1991) showed that when black participants were evaluated by a white person who was aware of their race, black subjects mistrusted the feedback, attributing negative feedback to the evaluator's stereotypes and positive feedback to the evaluator's desire to appear unbiased. When the black participants' race was unknown to the evaluator, they were more accepting of the feedback.<ref name="Crocker et al.">{{cite journal |last1= Crocker |first1= Jennifer |last2= Voelkl |first2= Kristin |last3= Testa |first3= Maria |last4= Major |first4= Brenda |year= 1991 |title= Social stigma: The affective consequences of attributional ambiguity |url= https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-personality-and-social-psychology_1991-02_60_2/page/218 |journal= [[Journal_of_Personality_and_Social_Psychology|Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]] |volume= 60 |issue= 2 |pages= 218–228|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.60.2.218 }}</ref>

Attributional ambiguity has been shown to affect a person's [[self-esteem|self-esteem]]. When they receive positive evaluations, stereotyped individuals are uncertain of whether they really deserved their success and, consequently, they find it difficult to take credit for their achievements. In the case of negative feedback, ambiguity has been shown to have a protective effect on self-esteem as it allows people to assign blame to external causes. Some studies, however, have found that this effect only holds when stereotyped individuals can be absolutely certain that their negative outcomes are due to the evaluators's prejudice. If any room for uncertainty remains, stereotyped individuals tend to blame themselves.<ref name="crocker-major-steele"/>

Attributional ambiguity can also make it difficult to assess one's skills because performance-related evaluations are mistrusted or discounted. Moreover, it can lead to the belief that one's efforts are not directly linked to the outcomes, thereby depressing one's [[motivation|motivation]] to succeed.<ref name="zemore-fiske-kim"/>

[[Claude_Steele|Claude M. Steele]] and Joshua Aronson conducted the first experiments showing that stereotype threat can depress intellectual performance on [[standardized_test|standardized test]]s. In one study, they found that black college students performed worse than white students on a verbal test when the task was framed as a measure of intelligence. When it was not presented in that manner, the performance gap narrowed.

Not only has stereotype threat been widely criticized by on a theoretical basis,<ref name=jensen>Arthur Robert Jensen "The g factor: the science of mental ability" 1998
{{ISBN|0-275-96103-6}},Praeger Publishers, 88 Post Road West, Westport, CT 06881, pages 513–515: "the phenomenon of stereotype threat can be explained in terms of a
more general construct, test anxiety, which has been studied since the early days
of psychometrics. Test anxiety tends to lower performance levels on tests
in proportion to the degree of complexity and the amount of mental effort they
require of the subject. The relatively greater effect of test anxiety in the black
samples, who had somewhat lower SAT scores, than the white subjects in the
Stanford experiments constitutes an example of the Yerkes-Dodson law ... by conducting the same type of experiment using exclusively white (or black)
subjects, divided into lower- and higher-ability groups, it might be shown that
the phenomenon attributed to stereotype threat has nothing to do with race as
such, but results from the interaction of ability level with test anxiety as a
function of test complexity."</ref><ref name="Stoet2012">{{Cite journal | last1 = Stoet | first1 = G. | last2 = Geary | first2 = D.

Word, [[Mark_Zanna|Zanna]], and Cooper (1974) demonstrated the effects of stereotypes in the context of a [[job_interview|job interview]]. White participants interviewed black and white subjects who, prior to the experiments, had been trained to act in a standardized manner. Analysis of the videotaped interviews showed that black job applicants were treated differently: They received shorter amounts of interview time and less eye contact; interviewers made more speech errors (e.g., [[Stuttering|stutters]], sentence incompletions, incoherent sounds) and physically distanced themselves from black applicants. In a second experiment, trained interviewers were instructed to treat applicants, all of whom were white, like the whites or blacks had been treated in the first experiment. As a result, applicants treated like the blacks of the first experiment behaved in a more nervous manner and received more negative performance ratings than interviewees receiving the treatment previously afforded to whites.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Word |first1= Carl O. |last2= Zanna |first2= Mark P. |last3= Cooper |first3= Joel |year= 1974 |title= The nonverbal mediation of self-fulfilling prophecies in interracial interaction |journal= Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |volume= 10 |issue= 2 |pages= 109–120 |doi= 10.1016/0022-1031(74)90059-6 }}</ref>

A 1977 study by Snyder, Tanke, and [[Ellen_S._Berscheid|Berscheid]] found a similar pattern in social interactions between men and women. Male [[Undergraduate_education|undergraduate students]] were asked to talk to female undergraduates, whom they believed to be [[Physical_attractiveness|physically attractive]] or unattractive, on the phone. The conversations were taped and analysis showed that men who thought that they were talking to an attractive woman communicated in a more positive and friendlier manner than men who believed that they were talking to unattractive women. This altered the women's behavior: Female subjects who, unknowingly to them, were perceived to be physically attractive behaved in a friendly, likeable, and sociable manner in comparison with subjects who were regarded as unattractive.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Snyder |first1= Mark |last2= Tanke |first2= Elizabeth D. |last3= Berscheid |first3= Ellen |year= 1977 |title= Social perception and interpersonal behavior: On the self-fulfilling nature of social stereotypes |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume= 35 |issue= 9 |pages= 656–666 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.35.9.656 |url= http://jefferson.library.millersville.edu/reserve/COMM301_Paul_SocialPerception.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120617031954/http://jefferson.library.millersville.edu/reserve/COMM301_Paul_SocialPerception.pdf |archive-date= 17 June 2012 |url-status= dead}}</ref>

A 2005 study by J. Thomas Kellow and Brett D. Jones looked at the effects of self-fulfilling prophecy on African American and Caucasian high school freshman students. Both white and black students were informed that their test performance would be predictive of their performance on a statewide, high stakes [[standardized_test|standardized test]]. They were also told that historically, white students had outperformed black students on the test. This knowledge created a self-fulfilling prophecy in both the white and black students, where the white students scored statistically significantly higher than the African American students on the test. The [[stereotype_threat|stereotype threat]] of underperforming on standardized tests affected the African American students in this study.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kellow|first=Thomas|date=February 2008|title=The Effects of Stereotypes on the Achievement Gap: Reexamining the Academic Performance of African American High School Students|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-black-psychology_2008-02_34_1/page/94|journal=Journal of Black Psychology|volume=34|pages=94–120|doi=10.1177/0095798407310537|citeseerx=10.1.1.553.9188|s2cid=145490359}}</ref>

Stereotypes can cause [[Racism|racist]] prejudice. For example, scientists and activists have warned that the use of the stereotype "Nigerian Prince" for referring to [[Advance-fee_scam|Advance-fee scam]]mers is racist, i.e. "reducing [[Nigeria|Nigeria]] to a nation of scammers and fraudulent princes, as some people still do online, is a stereotype that needs to be called out".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yékú|first=James|date=2020-09-09|title=Anti-Afropolitan ethics and the performative politics of online scambaiting|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02533952.2020.1813943|journal=Social Dynamics|volume=46|issue=2|pages=240–258|language=en|doi=10.1080/02533952.2020.1813943|s2cid=222232833|issn=0253-3952}}</ref>

=== Self-stereotyping ===
{{Main|Self-stereotyping}}
Stereotypes can affect self-evaluations and lead to self-stereotyping.<ref name="Cox et al.

(2006) has shown that Asian American women rated their math ability more favorably when their ethnicity and the relevant stereotype that Asian Americans excel in math was made salient. In contrast, they rated their math ability less favorably when their gender and the corresponding stereotype of women's inferior math skills was made salient. Sinclair et al. found, however, that the effect of stereotypes on self-evaluations is [[Mediation_(statistics)|mediated]] by the degree to which close people in someone's life endorse these stereotypes. People's self-stereotyping can increase or decrease depending on whether close others view them in stereotype-consistent or inconsistent manner.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Sinclair |first1= Stacey |last2= Hardin |first2= Curtis D. |last3= Lowery |first3= Brian S. |title= Self-Stereotyping in the Context of Multiple Social Identities |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |year= 2006 |volume= 90 |issue= 4 |pages= 529–542 |doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.90.4.529 |url= http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/sinclair/pubs/self%20stereo%20and%20multiple%20identities.PDF |pmid= 16649853 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140827125537/http://psych.princeton.edu/psychology/research/sinclair/pubs/self%20stereo%20and%20multiple%20identities.PDF |archive-date= 27 August 2014 |url-status= dead}}</ref>

Stereotyping can also play a central role in depression, when people have negative self-stereotypes about themselves, according to [[William_T._L._Cox|Cox]], [[Lyn_Yvonne_Abramson|Abramson]], [[Patricia_Devine|Devine]], and Hollon (2012).<ref name="Cox et al. (2012)"/> This depression that is caused by prejudice (i.e., "deprejudice") can be related to group membership (e.g., Me–Gay–Bad) or not (e.g., Me–Bad). If someone holds prejudicial beliefs about a stigmatized group and then becomes a member of that group, they may internalize their prejudice and develop depression. People may also show prejudice internalization through self-stereotyping because of negative childhood experiences such as verbal and physical abuse.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sachs|first1=Nicole M.|last2=Veysey|first2=Bonita M.|last3=Rivera|first3=Luis M.|date=14 November 2017|title=Implicit Social Cognitive Processes Underlying Victim Self and Identity: Evidence With College-Aged Adults|journal=Journal of Interpersonal Violence|volume=36|issue=3–4|pages=1256–1282|doi=10.1177/0886260517741625|pmid=29294984|s2cid=206565963}}</ref>

=== Substitute for observations ===
Stereotypes are traditional and familiar symbol clusters, expressing a more or less complex idea in a convenient way. They are often simplistic pronouncements about gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural backgrounds and they can become a source of misinformation and delusion. For example, in a school when students are confronted with the task of writing a theme, they think in terms of literary associations, often using stereotypes picked up from books, films, and magazines that they have read or viewed.

The danger in stereotyping lies not in its existence, but in the fact that it can become a substitute for observation and a misinterpretation of a [[cultural_identity|cultural identity]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=HAYAKAWA|first=S. I.|year=1950|jstor=42581302|journal=ETC: A Review of General Semantics|volume=7|issue=3|pages=208–210|title=Recognizing Stereotypes as Substitutes for Thought}}</ref> Promoting [[information_literacy|information literacy]] is a pedagogical approach that can effectively combat the entrenchment of stereotypes. The necessity for using information literacy to separate multicultural "fact from fiction" is well illustrated with examples from literature and media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/c9296b8ae9e329bdded001fbbe51f7a4/1?pq-origsite|title=Using information literacy to promote critical thinking – ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=26 April 2018}}</ref>

Stereotypes are common in various cultural [[Media_(communication)|media]], where they take the form of dramatic [[stock_character|stock character]]s. The instantly recognizable nature of stereotypes mean that they are effective in [[advertising|advertising]] and [[situation_comedy|situation comedy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tedb.byu.edu/?page_id=35|title=Lesson 2 – Stock Characters {{!}} BYU Theatre Education Database|website=tedb.byu.edu|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> Alexander Fedorov (2015) proposed a concept of media stereotypes analysis. This concept refers to identification and analysis of stereotypical images of people, ideas, events, stories, themes, etc. in media context.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fedorov|first1=Alexander|title=Media Stereotypes Analysis in the Classroom at the Student Audience|journal=European Journal of Contemporary Education|year=2015|volume=12|issue=2|pages=158–162|doi=10.13187/ejced.2015.12.158|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The characters that do appear in movies greatly affect how people worldwide perceive gender relations, race, and cultural communities. Because approximately 85% of worldwide ticket sales are directed toward Hollywood movies, the American movie industry has been greatly responsible for portraying characters of different cultures and diversity to fit into stereotypical categories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Kevin|date=January 2008|title="The Little State Department": Hollywood and the MPAA's Influence on U.S. Trade Relations|url=https://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1671&context=njilb|journal=Northwestern Journal of International Law & Business|volume= 28| issue = 2}}</ref> This has led to the spread and persistence of gender, racial, ethnic, and cultural stereotypes seen in the movies.<sup>[[Stereotype#cite_note-89|[89]]]</sup>

For example, [[Russians|Russians]] are usually portrayed as ruthless agents, brutal mobsters and villains in [[Hollywood|Hollywood]] movies.<ref>{{cite news |title=Will the cliche of the 'Russian baddie' ever leave our screens? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/10/will-cliche-russian-baddie-ever-leave-screens-james-norton-mcmafia |work=The Guardian |date=10 July 2017}}</ref><ref>"[http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2014/10/14/russian-film-industry-and-hollywood-uneasy-with-one-another/ Russian film industry and Hollywood uneasy with one another]."

Latin Americans are largely depicted as sexualized figures such as the Latino [[Machismo|macho]] or the Latina vixen, [[gang|gang]] members, (illegal) immigrants, or entertainers. By comparison, they are rarely portrayed as working professionals, business leaders or politicians.<ref name=":2" />

In [[Cinema_of_the_United_States|Hollywood films]], there are several Latin American stereotypes that have historically been used. Some examples are El Bandido, the Halfbreed Harlot, The Male Buffoon, The Female Clown, The Latin Lover, The Dark Lady, The Wise Old Man, and The Poor Peon. Many Hispanic characters in Hollywood films consists of one or more of these basic stereotypes, but it has been rare to view Latin American actors representing characters outside of this stereotypical criteria.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berg|first=Charles|date=Summer 1990|title=Stereotyping in films in general and of the Hispanic in Particular|journal=The Howard Journal of Communications|volume=2|issue=3|pages=294–296|doi=10.1080/10646179009359721}}</ref>

Media stereotypes of women first emerged in the early 20th century. Various stereotypic depictions or "types" of women appeared in magazines, including Victorian ideals of femininity, the [[New_Woman|New Woman]], the [[Gibson_Girl|Gibson Girl]], the [[Femme_fatale|Femme fatale]], and the [[Flapper|Flapper]].<sup>[[Stereotype#cite_note-88|[88]]]</sup><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=COLTRANE|first1=SCOTT|last2=ADAMS|first2=MICHELE|title=Work–Family Imagery and Gender Stereotypes:Television and the Reproduction of Difference|journal=Journal of Vocational Behavior|volume=50}}</ref>

Stereotypes are also common in video games, with women being portrayed as stereotypes such as the "[[damsel_in_distress|damsel in distress]]" or as [[sexual_object|sexual object]]s (see [[Gender_representation_in_video_games|Gender representation in video games]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://msu.edu/~pengwei/Mou&Peng_gender%20and%20racial%20stereotype.pdf|title=Gender and Racial Stereotypes in Popular Video Games|last1=Mou|first1=Yi|last2=Peng|first2=Wei|publisher=Michigan State University}}</ref> Studies show that minorities are portrayed most often in stereotypical roles such as athletes and gangsters (see [[Race_and_video_games|Racial representations in video games]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Burgess|first1=Melinda|last2=Dill|first2=Karen|date=15 September 2011|title=Playing With Prejudice: The Prevalence and Consequences of Racial Stereotypes in Video Games|journal=Media Psychology|volume= 14|issue=3|pages=289–311|doi=10.1080/15213269.2011.596467|s2cid=1416833}}</ref>

In [[literature|literature]] and [[art|art]], stereotypes are [[cliché|cliché]]d or predictable characters or situations. Throughout history, storytellers have drawn from stereotypical characters and situations to immediately connect the audience with new tales.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Auracher|first1=Jan|last2=Hirose|first2=Akiko|year=2017|title=The Influence of Reader's Stereotypes on the Assessment of Fictional Characters|jstor=10.5325/complitstudies.54.4.0795|journal=Comparative Literature Studies|volume=54|issue=4|pages=795–823|doi=10.5325/complitstudies.54.4.0795}}</ref>

== 常見的刻板印象 ==
以下為一些常見的刻板印象：

* [[性別偏見|性別偏見]](性別刻板印象)
: {{see|性別角色}}
: 「女生心機重、喜歡在背地裡搞小動作」、「男生活潑好動、女生比較文靜」、「男主外，女主內」、「男生唸理工，女生唸人文」<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweekly.com.tw/article.aspx?id=16736&type=Blog|title=洪蘭：讀女校可以打破「男生讀理工、女生念人文」的刻板印象|accessdate=2017-09-05|author=張德齡|date=2016-05-26|work=商業周刊 - 商周.com|publisher=|archive-date=2019-05-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190516172831/https://www.businessweekly.com.tw/article.aspx?id=16736&type=Blog|dead-url=no}}</ref>等等都是性別刻板印象。這種印象常常造成在工作上對於性別的歧視，例如男[[護士|護士]]或是女[[司機|司機]]，同時亦造成人際相處上的阻礙。若將這些思想付诸實踐，即成為性別歧視。
: 性別刻板印象甚至會對科學研究造成錯誤，一個例子是在[[瑞典|瑞典]][[比爾卡|比爾卡]]發現的[[比爾卡女性維京戰士|比爾卡女性維京戰士]]（Birka female Viking warrior），比爾卡女性維京戰士的墳墓剛被發掘時，人們因為墓主的戰士身分而假定墓主是男性，直到後來對墓主的骨頭的詳細研究出來後，人們才逐漸理解墓主是個女性戰士，因此古代對女性維京戰士的傳說未必是想像。

* [[性傾向|性傾向]]刻板印象
: 例如：「[[同性戀|同性戀]]的人全部都是[[愛滋病|愛滋病]]患者」、「[[1069|0號男同志]]都很女性化」、「女同志必有一方很男性化」、「男同性恋就是愛[[肛交|肛交]]」、「外表較陰柔、著重外表打扮或喜愛鍛鍊肌肉的男生就是gay」、「gay都喜歡很man身材粗曠的男生」、「雙性戀男女通吃、很好色」等等，都属于性傾向刻板印象。這種印象往往造成大眾對同性戀者的歧視。

* 地區、國家或種族刻板印象
: {{see|族群刻板印象}}
: 例如「[[法國|法國]]與浪漫的關联」<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=5077739|title=醒醒啊！法國跟你想的不一樣|author=謝芷霖|date=2016-08-06|work=|newspaper=天下雜誌|accessdate=2017-08-03|language=zh-TW|archive-date=2020-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401142604/https://www.cw.com.tw/article/article.action?id=5077739|dead-url=no}}</ref>（法國人所厭惡的刻板印象）、「[[日本人|日本人]]都愛吃[[生魚片|生魚片]]」、「美國人都很胖」、「美國人很浪費」、「[[非裔美国人|非裔美國人]]參與[[零元购|零元購]]」、「德國人一板一眼、約會很準時」、「亞洲人是書呆子」、「亞洲人數學都很好」、「華人都会[[功夫|功夫]]」、「黑人都會彈BASS」、「韓國美女都是整形出來的」、「大陸人都很沒有水準」、「台灣人都理盲濫情」、「俄羅斯人都很粗犷豪放（『戰鬥民族』）」、「閩人狹險，楚人輕易，今二相皆閩人，二參政皆楚人，必將援引鄉黨之士，充塞朝廷，風俗何以更得淳厚？」<ref>{{Cite book|title=《續資治通鑑》卷67|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>、「秦，虎狼之國，不可信，不如毋行」<ref>{{Cite book|title=《史記》|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=屈原列傳}}</ref>、「鄉下人老實，城市人狡詐」等即為地區/族群刻板印象。

* [[人類外貌|外表]]刻板印象
: {{see|外貌魅力偏見}}
: 例如「体态肥胖的人都贪吃，体形消瘦的人有疾病。」「長得高的是哥哥，長得矮的是弟弟」、「頭腦簡單，四肢發達」、「新的科技製造的東西永远比舊的好、比舊的有效率」、「刻板印象是不準確的」等皆為其例；另外[[中國大陸|中國大陸]]的男子給一些人的印象是以方形[[平頭|平頭]]為髮型且語氣粗獷，但並非代表所有中國大陸的男子皆然。
: 另外一些作品中會藉由外表的刻板印象來刻劃角色，像例如[[漫畫|漫畫]]中的人物造型，常以尖嘴猴腮的有錢人做為壞人的形象，便是一個例子。
: 此外一些人對[[機器|機器]]造型會有刻板印象。例子如下：
:: [[超級跑車|超級跑車]]等於[[中置後驅|中置後驅]]局佈才易保持穩定，當然早在數十年前的猛車只可以用這種笨方法，實際上新世紀的[[設計師|設計師]]可以用[[懸掛系統|懸掛系統]]等其他巧妙的設計達到同樣效果。
:: 早期[[渦輪噴射引擎|噴射]][[戰鬥機|戰鬥機]]採用機頭進氣的佈局，所以是沒有[[雷達|雷達]]的，實際上早在五十年代初的[[F-86|F-86]]已經擁有雷達，而二十一世紀經現代化改裝過的[[米格-21|米格-21]]，甚至可以發射引導中程[[空對空導彈|空對空導彈]]作超視距[[空戰|空戰]]。

* 喜好刻板印象
