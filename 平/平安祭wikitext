'''平安祭'''（[[希伯来语|希伯来语]]：'''Zebhah'''，''slaughter offering'' <ref>在现代希伯来语中''zebhah''仅仅表示“献祭”，但起初的含义是“宰杀” - Peake圣经注释；</ref>或'''Zebhah shelam'''，''sacrifice-of-peace offering''，有时简称为'''shelam'''，'''peace offering'''）是《[[聖經|聖經]]·[[利未记|利未记]]》中提到的第三种献祭，宰杀祭牲<!-- 为着筵席 --><ref>''Peake圣经注释、犹太百科全书</ref>。''shelam''通常翻译成“和平”，不过更准确的含义应该是“健康”或“繁荣”。<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> 

平安祭是人可以享用的祭物，祭司和献祭者可以享用此祭。平安祭可以使用任何祭牲，可以用无酵饼或有酵饼。平安祭表征基督是成就和平者，祂为我们受死流血，作了我们与神之间的和平与交通，使我们能与神共同享受基督，在祂里面与神相安、相交，神人同得满足─利三1～17，西一20～22。

<!-- 学者们不能确定 as to the significance of the occasional differentiation between ''shelam'' and ''zebhah'' in the Biblical text.<ref>{{JewishEncyclopedia}}</ref> In the late 19th century, a few scholars proposed that the ''shelam'' offering was a more solemn version of the ''zebah'' offering, and/or that the portion assigned allocated to God differed between them.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> -->

==类型==
平安祭包括三种类型：

*感谢祭 - <!-- made in response to an unexpected positive change in circumstance -->
*还愿祭 - <!-- made in response to a positive change in circumstance, when a [[vow|vow]] in hope of such a change had previously been made -->
*甘心祭 - <!-- more spontaneous ''slaughter offering''s -->

<!-- ''Slaughter offerings'' were also made in response to the ratification of solemn covenants, treaties, and alliances.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> -->

<!-- ==Ritual==
As the meal resulting from a ''slaughter offering'' was seen as holy, the guests were required to cleanse themselves, and change their garments if possible; impurity would have excluded them from participation.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> Sometimes festive garments, which were seen as having sanctity, were borrowed for this purpose from the priests, and rings, having the significance of amulets, were worn in honour of the deity.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> Like the other types of sacrifice, the act began with the imposition of the offerer's hands onto the sacrificial animal, which would then be killed, and its blood collected and sprinkled upon the altar; however, ''slaughter offerings'' could be killed anywhere within the sanctuary, not only on the north side of the altar.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> [[Oxen|Oxen]], [[sheep|sheep]], and [[goat|goat]]s, are explicitly identified by the Biblical text as being used for ''slaughter offerings'', but unlike other types of sacrifice, there was no rigid insistence that the animal be unblemished, or on the [[gender|gender]] of the animal.

The fat of the animal was the portion allocated to the deity, and was burnt on the altar; the priests were allocated the breast and right shoulder, which was first waved around the altar (making this portion a ''wave offering''); the remainder went to the offerer.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> The meat had to be consumed within a certain time limit; for ''praise offerings'' it had to be consumed on the day of the sacrifice, while for the other types of ''slaughter offering'' it had to be consumed by the day afterward; any leftovers had to be destroyed on the third day, outside the ''camp''.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> The offerer was permitted to invite guests to consume the meal with him, along with strangers, [[poverty|paupers]], [[servants|servants]], and [[Levites|Levites]], as long as they were all [[ritual_cleanliness|ritually clean]]. The meals were treated as a joyful occasion, and would be accompanied with wine, as well as bread (both [[raising_agent|leavened]] and unleavened), oil, and [[salt|salt]].<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> -->

<!-- ==Origin==
Exactly what the term ''peace'' (in ''sacrifice-of-peace offering'') refers to is a matter of debate, as is whether the deity was seen as a guest at the meal or as the host.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> Some scholars hold that the ''sacrifice-of-peace offering'' was a covenant of friendship expressing community between God and the people, and among the people themselves; that these groups were ''at peace'' with one another.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> Others claim that it is an attempt to balance the books when positive events occur, attributed to God, by favouring God with a meal, or by fulfilling a vow previously made, as appropriate to the situation; that rehabilitation is achieved and the people restored to ''perfection'' (''make perfect'' being a possible meaning of ''shelam'').<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> In the latter of these possibilities, and partly in the former, the sacrifice is regarded as ''for'' God, and hence that the people are merely guests at the meal. 

However, what is generally considered the most likely explanation, is that ''sacrifice-of-peace offerings'' simply originated as meals, the consumption of which directly improved health (as opposed to starvation), and hence indirectly improved prosperity (''shelam'' being understood to mean ''prosperity''/''health'').<ref>''Peake's commentary on the Bible''</ref> When sanctuaries outside [[Jerusalem|Jerusalem]] began to be suppressed, and eventually outlawed by [[Josiah|Josiah]], the impracticality of going to Jerusalem to sacrifice an animal simply to consume meat, led to [[shechita|killing an animal for food]] gaining an independent existence from the ''sacrifice-of-peace offering''.<ref>''Ibid.''</ref> 

The concentration of these sacrifices, the main offering given by private individuals, at a single sanctuary evidently resulted in such large numbers of offers that the space on the north side of the altar, where the animals were killed in the other types of sacrifices, became cramped, hence why animals for ''sacrifice-of-peace offerings'' were permitted to be killed anywhere within the sanctuary courtyard.<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia''</ref> How exactly a portion of the resulting meat was ''given'' to God appears to have varied; though the regulations of the [[Priestly_Code|Priestly Code]] point to God's portion being burnt on the altar, [[Gideon|Gideon]] is described in the [[Book_of_Judges|Book of Judges]], a text which [[textual_criticism|textual scholars]] believe has a much earlier date than Leviticus<ref>''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''Book of Judges''</ref>, as pouring out [[broth|broth]], made from the meat of the sacrifice, as a [[libation|libation]]. -->
