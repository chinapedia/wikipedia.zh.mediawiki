'''碧瑶'''（City of Baguio；{{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Baguio}} ; {{le|伊瓦洛伊语|Ibaloi language}}：''Ciudad ni Bagiw''）是位于[[菲律宾|菲律宾]][[吕宋岛|吕宋岛]]北部[[本格特省|本格特省]]的一个城市。该市的海拔高度约为1500米，风景优美，空气清新，是菲律宾国内首屈一指的旅游胜地。它也是[[吕宋岛热带松林|吕宋岛热带松林]][[栖息地|栖息地]]，适合苔藓植物和兰花的生长，<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/im0302|title=Southeastern Asia: Island of Luzon in the Philippines|accessdate=2014-08-16|publisher=WWF|archive-date=2014-08-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085056/http://www.worldwildlife.org/ecoregions/im0302|dead-url=no}}</ref>碧瑶当地土著名“Bagiw”就是苔藓的意思。

1900年，美国人在伊瓦洛伊人村庄Kafagway的遗址上建了一个山中避暑地<ref>{{cite journal|last=Estoque|first=Ronald C.|author2=Yuji Murayama |title=City Profile: Baguio |journal=Cities |date=February 2013  |volume=30 |pages=240–251 |doi=10.1016/j.cities.2011.05.002|accessdate=2013-04-05}}</ref>，并逐渐繁荣起来。因为它凉爽的气候，1903年6月1日，碧瑶市被[[菲律宾委员会|菲律宾委员会]]（Philippine Commission）指定为[[菲律宾|菲国]]的[[夏都|夏都]]，1909年9月1日由[[菲律宾议政委员会|菲律宾议政委员会(Philippines Assembly)]]将该地合并扩建为市。2009年9月1日该市举行建市百年庆祝。这里有总统官邸、最高法院、立法办公室。<!-- 碧瑶is the seat [[Cordillera_Administrative_Region|Cordillera Administrative Region]]政府。 --><!-- 该市的名称来源于 the word ''bagiw'' in Ibaloi, the indigenous language of the Benguet Region, meaning 'moss'。该市的海拔高度约为1500米 in a moist tropical pine forest conducive to the growth of mossy plants and orchids. --> 
 
根据2010年的人口普查，碧瑶市拥有318,676.<ref name="census.gov.ph"/>

碧瑶与[[马尼拉|马尼拉]]距离260公里，交通便利。碧瑶为重要的金矿中心，其附近的[[曼卡延|曼卡延]]产[[铜|铜]]。市内有军事学院和两所大学。1990年7月16日吕宋中部的地震使碧瑶遭到严重破坏。

==地理==

<!-- The three main access roads leading to 碧瑶 from the lowlands are [[Kennon_Road|Kennon Road]], [[Marcos_Highway|Marcos Highway]], and [[Naguilian_Highway|Naguilian Highway]]. Kennon Road starts from [[Rosario,_La_Union|Rosario, La Union]] and winds through a narrow, steep valley. This is the fastest route to Baguio but is dangerous, with landslides during the rainy season. Marcos Highway, which starts from [[Agoo,_La_Union|Agoo, La Union]], and Naguilian Highway, which starts from [[Bauang,_La_Union|Bauang, La Union]], are longer routes but are safer than Kennon Road and are the preferred routes for coaches, buses and lorries. -->
== 交通 ==
=== 飛機 ===

目前已無由[[馬尼拉|馬尼拉]]至碧瑤的班機。

=== 巴士 ===
從首都[[馬尼拉|馬尼拉]]出發，可搭乘 [http://www.victoryliner.com Victory Liner] {{Wayback|url=http://www.victoryliner.com/ |date=20200829091449 }} 至碧瑤，並提供普通車型及豪華車型可選，行車時間約4到6小時。

== 经济 ==

<!-- The primary economy of Baguio City is its educational centers of which it has in excess of seven colleges and universities as well as a plethora of trade and technical schools. Estimates are that these schools compose in excess of one hundred thousand students.

The secondary source of income for the residents is its character as the commercial hub in the province of Benguet. Many of the agricultural and mining goods produced in [[Benguet|Benguet]] goes to Baguio City for central distribution.

The city is also a major retail center for the Cordilleras and the Ilocos provinces, with shoppers from the provinces coming to the city to take advantage of the diversity of competitively priced commercial products on sale, most of which are only available in Manila. Despite the city's small size, there are numerous shopping centers and malls in the business district catering to the growing commercial activity in Baguio. These are the SM City Baguio mall, Baguio Centermall, Cooyeesan Hotel Plaza, Abanao Square, Maharlika Livelihood Center, and Porta Vaga mall.

The areas of Session Road, Harrison Road, Magsaysay Avenue and Abanao Street comprise the trade center of the city. It is in these areas where commercial and business structures abound. First class movie houses, hotels, restaurants, department stores, and shopping centers are found in this downtown area. Shopping at the famous city market offers one a wide array of locally sourced goods and products, from colorful woven fabrics and strung beads to primitive wood carvings, cut flowers, strawberries and vegetables. (Strawberries and string beans - known as 'Baguio beans' across the Philippines - are shipped to major urban markets.)

Baguio is also home to one of the country's most profitable Philippine Economic Zone Authority areas (PEZA), called the Baguio City Economic Zone (BCEZ), located in the southern part of the city between the Camp John Hay leisure resort and the Philippine Military Academy. Firms located in the BCEZ mostly produce and export knitted clothing, transistors, small components for vehicles, electronics and other computer parts. Notable firms include [[Texas_Instruments|Texas Instruments]] Philippines, MOOG, and [[Client_Logic|Client Logic]]. Recently, there has been an influx of [[call_centers|call centers]] in the city with American companies outsourcing their technical support facilities in the country. -->

旅游业是碧瑶的主要产业。通常，海外游客经过碧瑶，而菲律宾人以此为目的地。

== 文化教育 ==

[[File:Bagio_Cathedral.jpg|right]]
碧瑶是一座大学城。它被认为是整个北吕宋的教育中心。在碧瑶市有八所高等教育院校，其中二所跻身全国前十名。<!--

碧瑶的青年人占城市人口的多数，这使它具有与菲律宾其他城市截然不同的风情。

Today, the number of beggars and squatters from the Southern part of the Philippines is increasing that it contributes to the pollution of the city. Many beggars are scattered especially on parks and other public places destroying the city's green and clean environment. In fact, the smell of pines which was adored before can no longer be smelled in the downtown. Only places farther from town can you still smell the pines' fragrance. -->

== 氣候 ==
碧瑶市因全境都位於1000至2000米高的山脈之上，氣溫相比其他相同緯度的國家或城市低得多，加上地處之緯度較低，每年溫差甚少，平均氣溫都在12至25度之間，因該地天氣清涼，故碧瑶一直成為菲律賓人的避暑勝地。

== 政府 ==

<!-- Like most Philippine cities, Baguio is governed by a Mayor, Vice Mayor, and twelve (12) Councilors.

The current mayor of Baguio is [[Peter_Rey_Bautista|Reinaldo Bautista Jr.]] who assumed office after the suspension of [[Braulio_Yaranon|Braulio Yaranon]] in [[August|August]] [[2006|2006]].  Controversy surrounded Yaranon's term, one of the most problematic in Baguio's history, {{Fact|date=February 2007}}, due in part to the [[Jadewell|Jadewell]] pay parking scandal, which resulted in the firm filing charges against him and [[Malacañang|Malacañang]]'s favoritism, and ordering his suspension until the end of his term on [[June_30|June 30]], [[2007|2007]].  They were preceded in office by [[Bernardo_Vergara|Bernardo Vergara]], who was defeated by Yaranon in the mayoral elections of 2004.

The City is also currently represented in the Philippine House of Representatives by Congressman [[Mauricio_Domogan|Mauricio Domogan]], who previously served three terms as Mayor.

Baguio City comprises one congressional district that is represented by a congressman in the [[House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines|House of Representatives]]. The city is administrative center for the [[Cordillera_Administrative_Region|Cordillera Administrative Region]].

Baguio City is politically subdivided into 129 [[barangay|barangay]]s. -->

== 历史 ==

<!-- The region around Baguio was first settled by the [[Cordillerano|Cordillerano]]s, primarily the [[Kankane-y|Kankane-y]], [[Ibaloi|Ibaloi]], and [[Itogon|Itogon]] tribes. In nearby La Trinidad, Spaniards established a ''commandante'' or military garrison, although Kafagway, as Baguio was once known, was barely touched. In 1901 Americans in an engineering built [http://www.gobaguio.com/files/Pages/articles-kennon.html Kennon Road], the first road directly connecting Kafagway with the lowlands of Pangasinan. Before this, the only road to Kafagway was ≈[[Naguilian_Road|Naguilian Road]], now known as the [[Quirino_Highway|Quirino Highway]]. In [[September_1|September 1]], [[1909|1909]] Baguio was declared a chartered city. It was planned according to the American architect Burnham, but his plan was used only to a small extent, primarily due to the hilly terrain. Americans declared Baguio the Summer Capital of the Philippines and The Mansion as the residence of the American governor-general to escape Manila's Summer heat. Americans further developed Baguio, building parks and public structures such as [[Wright_Park|Wright Park]], [[Burnham_Park|Burnham Park]], [[Governor_Pack_Road|Governor Pack Road]], [[Session_Road|Session Road]], [[Assumption_Road|Assumption Road]].

With Philippine independence in 1946, Americans settled in the city and [[English_language|English]] became the primary ''lingua franca''. Ilocanos joined the Cordilleranos in Baguio, and the population of Americans, Dutch, Belgians, and Germans soared. Baguio was relatively quiet from 1946 to [[July_16|July 16]], [[1990|1990]], when an [[July_16_Earthquake|earthquake destroyed most of Baguio]]. The city was quickly rebuilt. 

Around May 2003, a petition initiated by Dion Fernandez to declare Baguio a [[heritage_zone|heritage zone]] was circulated on the Internet and national print media, gaining more than 10,000 signatures. The petition calls upon unspecified officials to create the Zone prior to the Baguio centennial in 2009. In May 2005, the Heritage Conservation Society submitted to the Baguio City Council a proposed Special Heritage Bill drafted by HCS Trustee Ivan Henares. It has been approved on second reading but is being opposed by a group of businessmen. -->
