'''摩頓灣'''（{{lang-en|Moreton Bay}}）是位於[[澳大利亞|澳大利亞]][[昆士蘭州|昆士蘭州]][[府城|府城]][[布里斯本|布里斯本]]以東19公-{里}-的一處[[海灣|海灣]]，約形成於6,000年前，乃昆州最重要的[[海岸|海岸]][[資源|資源]]<ref name="sgnrm">{{cite book |title=Strategic Guide to Natural Resource Management in South East Queensland  |author = South East Queensland Regional Strategic Group |year=2000 |publisher= |location= |ISBN = 0734517408 |page = 56 }}</ref>。摩頓灣的水域是當地人最常親近的一片天然休閒場所，也是近海[[漁民|漁民]]賴以為生的地方。

[[布里斯本港|布里斯本港]]位於摩頓灣之北；廣大平坦的地勢，成為[[布里斯本機場|布里斯本機場]]和[[噪音|噪音]][[汙染|汙染]]的緩衝地帶。由於此處擁有大片的沙灘，水產豐富，所以在[[歐洲人|歐洲人]]殖民初期，此地是新移民與[[澳大利亞原住民|澳大利亞原住民]]經常發生衝突的地方。

由於一連串外海島嶼影響限制了[[珊瑚海|珊瑚海]]的海水流動，摩爾頓灣形勢上更接近於一座[[潟湖|潟湖]]。<!--<ref name="mbs"/> The [[tidal_range|tidal range]] is moderate at 1.5—2 m in range.

==歷史==
摩爾頓灣大約在6000年前時，因為海平面上升將原本[[布里斯班河|布里斯班河]]的[[氾濫平原|氾濫平原]]給淹沒而形成。

摩爾頓灣（澳大利亞原住民稱為Quandamooka）及周邊島嶼最早是[[澳大利亞原住民|澳大利亞原住民]]所居住棲息的地方， 1770年5月15日[[庫克船長|庫克船長]]首次航行通過此地時，以[[英國皇家學會|英國皇家學會]]會長[[James_Douglas,_14th_Earl_of_Morton|Lord Morton]]之名命名為Morton's Bay。<ref name="heritage">{{cite book |title=Heritage Trails of the Great South East |last=[[Environmental_Protection_Agency_(Queensland)|Environmental Protection Agency (Queensland)]] |year=2000 |publisher=State of Queensland |isbn=0-7345-1008-X |pages=4 }}</ref>  Moreton的寫法是因為[[庫克船長|庫克船長]]的航海紀錄的第一次出版時誤拼所造成<ref>[[Ray_Parkin|Ray Parkin]], ''H. M. Bark Endeavour'', [[Miegunyah_Press|Miegunyah Press]], second edition 2003, ISBN 0-522-85093-6, page 226.</ref>。<!--(Hawkesworth's ''Voyages''<ref>[http://southseas.nla.gov.au/journals/hv23/513.html ''Voyages in the Southern Hemisphere''], [[John_Hawkesworth_(book_editor)|John Hawkesworth]], 1773, volumes II-III, page 513 (online at the [[National_Library_of_Australia|National Library of Australia]]).</ref>).  Cook gave the name only to the [[bight_(geography)|bight]] formed by the northern end of Stradbroke Island (in 1770, there was only one island) and the eastern side of Moreton Island.  He was unaware of the [[South_Passage_(Queensland)|South Passage]] (as it's now called) between the two islands, and didn't sail into what is the present Moreton Bay.-->

<!--[[Matthew_Flinders|Matthew Flinders]] was the first recorded European to enter the Bay in 1799 touching down at the Pumicestone Passage, Redcliffe and Coochiemudlo Island. He was followed by [[John_Oxley|John Oxley]] who explored the Brisbane River in 1823. On a subsequent visit in the following year, Oxley established the first European settlement in the Bay at the present site of Redcliffe.{{fact|date=March 2009}}

After Oxley in 1823 came convicts and soldiers. As the South Passage between Moreton and Stradbroke Islands was the shortest [[shipping_route|shipping route]], a depot and pilot station were established at Amity Point in 1825.<ref name="rcc">{{cite web |url=http://www.redland.qld.gov.au/Residents/History/Oursuburbs/NorthStradbrokeIsland/Pages/default.aspx |title=Redland City Council: North Stradbroke Island |accessdate=2009-08-21 |publisher=[[Redland_City_Council|Redland City Council]] }}</ref>

White settlement began in earnest after the abandonment of the Redcliffe settlement, and work began on the new [[Penal_colony|convict settlement]] several miles up the Brisbane River in 1825. Within a couple years this new settlement was growing rapidly and the number of ships entering the bay was increasing. As a result, the facilities required to service the pilot station at Amity grew, and in 1827 convicts were sent to the island to build a new causeway at Dunwich, remnants of which can still be found on the same site. Within a year the first permanent white settlement at Dunwich had been built.<ref name="rcc"/> Due to poor weather, smuggling, and conflict with aborigines this convict out-station was difficult to sustain and was closed in 1931.<ref name="chims">{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/chims/placeDetail.html?siteId=15548&format=print |title=Dunwich Cemetery |accessdate=2009-08-29 |work=Cultural heritage information management system |publisher=The State of Queensland (Environmental Protection Agency) }}</ref>

The first [[immigrant|immigrant]] ship from England, the ''[[Artemisia_(ship)|Artemisia]]'', reached Moreton Bay in December 1848 after a four month journey.<ref name="lhbris">{{cite book |title=Living History of Brisbane |last=Hogan |first=Janet |year=1982 |publisher=Boolarang Punlications |location=Spring Hill, Queensland |isbn=0908175418 |pages=24—25 }}</ref>

By the 1850s the regions earliest industry was utilising the bay for the transport of [[timber|timber]]. After felling the logs were dragged or rolled into flooded streams from where they were washed downstream to tidal reaches and bound together into rafts. After the floods had ceased and tides returned to normal, the [[Ocean_current|currents]] of the bay and sometimes boats were used to direct the timber north to the Brisbane River or to Dunwich for shipment to Sydney.<ref name="stories">{{cite book |title=Stories of the Southside |last=Roberts |first=Beryl |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=Aussie Books |location=Archerfield, Queensland |isbn=094733601X |pages=75 }}</ref>

The bay was home to the ''[[Lightship_Rose|Lightship Rose]]'' which provided a permanent navigation aid to passing ships at the mouth of the Brisbane River. The ''[[John_Oxley_(ship)|John Oxley]]'' was another notable boat which temporarily acted as a pilot ship.

Car ferries began crossing the bay to reach North Stradbroke Island in 1947, leading to an increase in tourism on the island.<ref name="rcc"/> In 1949, the first annual [[Brisbane_to_Gladstone_yacht_race|Brisbane to Gladstone yacht race]] was held. In the 1950's both sand mining and the first land sales at Point Lookout occurred.<ref name="rcc"/>-->

<!--===European contact with Aborigines===
At first the Quandamooka tribes had a choice of avoiding contact or engaging with the Europeans at the various small government institutions that were established on the mainland and on Minjerribah ([[Stradbroke_Island|Stradbroke Island]]). Aboriginal labour and resources were however, voluntarily supplied to assist these newcomers, for example, at the pilot station. Problems came about when the newcomers displayed a lack of respect for Aboriginal marriage rules, stole bones and other artefacts and desecrated sites important to the Aboriginals.<ref name="qldhistory">{{cite book |title=A History of Queensland |last=Evans |first=Raymond |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Port Melbourne, Victoria |isbn=9780521876926 |pages=46 }}</ref> This produced a period of conflict through the 1830s, sometimes followed up by reprisals with guns, during which a number of Aboriginal people were massacred.

Like the mainland tribes, the Nooghie, Noonuccal and Goenpul people struggled when Moreton Bay was opened up to free settlers. The mainland Aboriginal people in particular were progressively deprived of the traditional [[hunting|hunting]] grounds and food. When they turned to killing domestic stock in order to survive, they were rounded up and shot. As their tribal groups and way of life disintegrated, many drifted towards towns and cities. Because of their isolation, the people of the islands however, managed to keep a lot of their traditional ways alive.{{fact|date=March 2009}} 

In 1843, Catholic [[Missionary|Missionaries]] chose Dunwich as the site for the first Catholic Mission to Australian Aborigines.<ref name="chims"/> The sand islands of Quandamooka did not support pasturage suitable for sheep and cattle, and thus there did not occur conversion of large tracts of land into farms and pastoral properties and the subsequent widespread annihilation and displacement of Aboriginal people. The very existence of the [[quarantine|quarantine]] station on Stradbroke Island from 1850 to the 1870s led to the official discouragement of [[pastoralism|pastoralism]] or wider settlement for fear of spreading disease.<ref name="rcc"/> Another reason for discouraging settlement was to reduce the likelihood of incoming vessels to the bay evading customs duty.
[[Image:Tangalooma_Wrecks_2002-06-02.jpeg|thumb]] ceased operations.]]
Thus the European usage and occupation of Quandamooka in the 19th century was largely restricted to government institutions on small portions on the islands, and with [[free_enterprise|free enterprise]] business men like the Campbell brothers who ran a saltworks and sugar [[plantation|plantation]]s on Russell and Macleay islands, and the early fishing and oystering businesses in the bay who employed the Aboriginal people of Quandamooka.

[[Indigenous_peoples|Aboriginal peoples]] were a source of labour for various institutions and enterprises from the time of the first pilot station. Conflict with Europeans intensified during the middle part of the 19th century, leading to significant numbers of Aboriginal people being killed (including at the hands of the native police). Despite these conflicts other Aboriginal people were able to evade intense contact due to the lack of European activity on the bay islands. From the 1830s to 1865 there remained virtual exclusive Aboriginal possession of most of Quandamooka. However trade and [[social_interaction|social interaction]] with the mainland groups gradually diminished due to the outward march of pastoral settlement on the mainland. This resulted in unrepairable damage to indigenous [[social_network|social network]]s and patterns of group intermarriage, as well as joint ceremonial activities.-->

<!--==Geography==The bay extends some 125 km from [[Caloundra,_Queensland|Caloundra]] in the north almost to [[Surfers_Paradise,_Queensland|Surfers Paradise]] in the south.<ref name="mbrc"/>  The bay's southern navigation entrance is the [[Gold_Coast_Seaway|Gold Coast Seaway]]. The bay is 35 km across at its widest point.

It is separated from the [[Pacific_Ocean|Pacific Ocean]] by a chain of three [[sand_island|sand island]]s - [[Moreton_Island|Moreton Island]] in the north, [[North_Stradbroke_Island|North Stradbroke Island]], and [[South_Stradbroke_Island|South Stradbroke Island]] in the south. [[Tipplers_Passage|Tipplers Passage]] is the main channel on the western coast of South Stradbroke Island. The [[Gold_Coast_Seaway|Gold Coast Seaway]] is at the southern extent of Moreton Bay, before the [[Gold_Coast_Broadwater|Gold Coast Broadwater]].

The bay itself contains around 360 islands in total. This includes the populated [[Russell_Island_(Moreton_Bay)|Russell]], [[Macleay_Island|Macleay]], [[Lamb_Island_(Moreton_Bay)|Lamb]] and [[Karragarra_Island_(Moreton_Bay)|Karragarra]] Islands collectively known as the [[Southern_Moreton_Bay_Islands_(Queensland)|Southern Moreton Bay Islands]]. [[Residential_development|Residential development]] has also occurred on [[Coochiemudlo_Island|Coochiemudlo Island]] and [[Bribie_Island|Bribie Island]]. In the past [[Peel_Island|Peel Island]] has been used as a sisal plantation, quarantine station, asylum and a leper colony.

Moreton Bay is generally shallow and sandy, though a substantive channel is maintained to allow access to the [[Port_of_Brisbane|Port of Brisbane]] at Fisherman Islands at the mouth of the [[Brisbane_River,_Queensland|Brisbane River]], for international shipping.  As well as the Brisbane River, the [[Pimpama_River|Pimpama River]], [[Logan_River,_Queensland|Logan River]], [[Albert_River_(Queensland)|Albert River]], [[Pine_River_(Queensland)|Pine River]], [[Tingalpa_Creek|Tingalpa Creek]] and the [[Schulz_Canal|Schulz Canal]] all empty into Moreton Bay.  Within Moreton Bay are the smaller bays of Waterloo Bay, Redland Bay, Raby Bay, Deception Bay and [[Bramble_Bay|Bramble Bay]].

===Protected areas===
Moreton Island is protected as [[Moreton_Island_National_Park|Moreton Island National Park]]. The bay itself contains [[St_Helena_Island_National_Park|St Helena Island National Park]] and the [[Moreton_Bay_Marine_Park|Moreton Bay Marine Park]] with areas designated under the Marine Park Zoning Plan. The Marine Park was declared in 1993 and covers 3400 square kilometres<ref>[http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks_and_forests/find_a_park_or_forest/moreton_bay_marine_park/ Moreton Bay Marine Park] {{Wayback|url=http://www.epa.qld.gov.au/parks_and_forests/find_a_park_or_forest/moreton_bay_marine_park/ |date=20071218065013 }}.

Parts of the bay are also protected under the [[Southern_Moreton_Bay_Islands_National_Park|Southern Moreton Bay Islands National Park]]. According to the [[Ramsar_Convention|Ramsar Wetland Convention 1971]], parts of Moreton Bay are listed as a [[wetland|wetland]] of international importance.

===Sandbanks===
Moreton Bay is filled with [[sandbank|sandbank]]s. Between Tangalooma and Skirmish Point on Bribie Island are the Middle Banks, Central Banks and Western Banks.  From north of Moreton Island towards Caloundra are the Yulle Road, Spitfire Bank, and the Salamander Bank, amongst others.

Amity Banks are found just west of Amity Point, while the Moreton Banks lie to the west of the southern tip of Moreton Island. These banks can be hazard for marine navigation because they are constantly changing due to tidal currents.
[[Image:SandsOfTime2fla400.jpg|thumb]]
The Middle Banks area close to Moreton Island has been used in the past as a source of [[sand|sand]] for large projects such as the nearby [[Brisbane_Airport|Brisbane Airport]] and port facilities. Past dredging has removed 18 Mn<sup>3</sup> and the removal of another 40 Mn<sup>3</sup> is planned.<ref>New Parallel Runway Draft EIS/MDP Middle Banks, Moreton Bay Chapter 1. p 4. [[Brisbane_Airport_Corporation|Brisbane Airport Corporation]]</ref> Future sand extraction is expected to aid a major shipping channel straightening project.

To ensure the shipping channel remains open, several areas of the bay have been allocated for dredged material dumping sites. These sites have been selected to provide [[beach_nourishment|beach nourishment]], aiding the natural long shore transport of sand along ocean beaches.

==Events==
In 1949, the first annual [[Brisbane_to_Gladstone_yacht_race|Brisbane to Gladstone yacht race]] was held starting in Moreton Bay. This event is a popular sailing event held on the bay and is one of many that occur. There are several other sailing events held throughout the bay, generally starting from the Manly Royal Queensland Yacht Squadron. Recreational fishing is a big part of the bay's history and there is an annual [[Moreton_Bay_Classic|Moreton Bay Classic]] fishing competition run by Brisbane Fishing Online held from the Manly foreshore. The bay is home to many watersports and activities including jet-skiing, windsurfing and water-skiing. Snorkelling is especially popular around [[Tangalooma|Tangalooma]] on Moreton Island as well.

==Flora and fauna==
The bay's heritage protected wetlands, mudflats, and waterways are some of the healthiest in the region, supporting seasonally up to 25 % of Australia's bird species.<ref>South East Queensland Regional Strategy Group. ''Strategic Guide to Resource Management in South East Queensland''. November 2000. p 115.</ref> Collectively, around 50,000 wading birds visit the Moreton Bay each year.<ref name="mbrc">{{cite web |url=http://www.moretonbay.qld.gov.au/discover.aspx?id=350&terms=Moreton+Bay |title=Moreton Bay Marine Park |author= |accessdate=2009-08-29 |date= |work= |publisher=[[Moreton_Bay_Regional_Council|Moreton Bay Regional Council]] }}</ref> The bay is home to other abundant wildlife, including [[whale|whale]]s, [[dolphin|dolphin]]s, [[dugong|dugong]], [[shark|shark]]s and [[turtles|turtles]].

The bay is extremely popular with recreational [[Angling|anglers]]

The [[Moreton_Bay_bug|Moreton Bay bug]] (''Thenus orientalis'') is a species of [[slipper_lobster|slipper lobster]] found throughout the waters of Australia's north coast. The Bug is a relatively expensive delicacy served in many restaurants in Queensland. The [[Moreton_Bay_Fig|Moreton Bay Fig]] (''Ficus macrophylla'') is endemic to the east coast of Australia within a range centred on Moreton Bay.

The southern and western parts of the bay contain shallow mud-layered waters that are protected from strong wave action by the barrier islands. This has provided excellent habitat for mangroves of which seven different species thrive within the bay.<ref name="imb">{{cite book |title = Islands of Moreton Bay |last=Horton |first=Helen |year=1983 |publisher=Boolarong Publications |location=Spring Hill, Queensland |ISBN = 0908175671 |page = 10 }}</ref>-->
