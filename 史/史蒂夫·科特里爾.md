==生平==
===球員===
Cotterill started his playing career in the [[Football_Conference|non-leagues]] as a forward who could play centrally or in wide positions, playing semi-professionally at clubs like [[Cheltenham_Town_F.C.|Cheltenham Town]], [[Alvechurch_F.C.|Alvechurch]] and [[Burton_Albion_F.C.|Burton Albion]]. He then signed his first professional contract, with [[Wimbledon_F.C.|Wimbledon]], after a £120,000 deal was done with Burton. He made 44 appearances in four years at Wimbledon and went out on loan to [[Brighton_&_Hove_Albion_F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] to recapture his fitness following a serious cruciate knee-ligament injury.  This led to further games at the Dons and he turned down a £500,000 bid from Southampton before finally moving on again to [[A.F.C._Bournemouth|Bournemouth]].

Cotterill signed for Bournemouth in the summer of 1993 for the fee of £120,000.  He was out of contract and this fee was set by the then Transfer Tribunal. In three years at Bournemouth he got his career back in good shape scoring 15 goals in 45 league starts for the club. While at the club he picked up three player of the season awards but had to finish his career in 1995 after another bad knee injury from which he was unable to fully recover.

;斯萊戈
Following on from [[Lawrie_Sanchez|Lawrie Sanchez]], [[Sligo_Rovers_F.C.|Sligo Rovers]] appointed Cotterill in 1995. He led the club to third place in the [[League_of_Ireland_Premier_Division|Premier Division]] of the [[League_of_Ireland|League of Ireland]] and his side also reached the [[League_of_Ireland_Cup|League of Ireland Cup]] final, where they lost on penalties to [[Shelbourne_F.C.|Shelbourne]].  Cotterill also led them into Europe, playing against teams such as [[FC_Nantes|Nantes]] where they earned a 3–3 draw and another creditable 0–0 draw against Dutch outfit, [[SC_Heerenveen|Heerenveen]].

;車頓咸
Cotterill joined Cheltenham when they were still a non-league club and he built up a successful side which won promotion from the [[Southern_Football_League_Premier_Division|Southern Football League Premier Division]] to the [[Football_Conference|Football Conference]] in his first full year at the club. He won the [[FA_Trophy|FA Trophy]] in 1998, beating [[Southport_F.C.|Southport]] 1–0 in the final, and Cheltenham finished second in the Conference the same year, their first season in that league. Cheltenham won the Conference and with it promotion to [[the_Football_League|the Football League]] the following year. His first two seasons in the [[Football_League_Third_Division|Third Division]] saw them finish in the top half. In [[2001–02_in_English_football|2001–02]], the club reached the fifth round of the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] for the first time in its history, ended only by a 1–0 away defeat to [[West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and including the defeat of Cotterill's future club Burnley.  He twice won the prestigious award of Manager of the Year during his tenure. Cotterill took Cheltenham into the [[Football_League_Second_Division|Second Division]] that season, following a play-off victory over [[Rushden_&_Diamonds|Rushden & Diamonds]] at the [[Millennium_Stadium|Millennium Stadium]] in Cardiff. He was awarded his [[UEFA_Pro_Licence|UEFA Pro Licence]] in 2002.

Cotterill left Cheltenham to join [[Stoke_City_F.C.|Stoke City]] in the summer of 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/3028537/Cotterill-unveiled-by-Stoke.html|title=Cotterill unveiled by Stoke|accessdate=19 October 2011|publisher=The Telegraph}}</ref> After a steady start with the ''Potters'' Cotterill shocked the club by handing in his resignation after just 13 games in order to become assistant manager to [[Howard_Wilkinson|Howard Wilkinson]] at Sunderland.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2002/oct/10/newsstory.sport13|title=Stoke 'shocked' by Cotterill walkout|accessdate=19 October 2011|publisher=The Guardian}}</ref> This earned Cotterill 'hate figure' status with the Stoke fans and is booed by the crowd when he returns to the [[Britannia_Stadium|Britannia Stadium]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/4129757.stm|title=Stoke 0-1 Burnley|accessdate=19 October 2011|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

As [[Howard_Wilkinson|Howard Wilkinson]]'s assistant, they were tasked with keeping Sunderland in the Premiership. However, Sunderland recorded just two league victories under the new management team and both Wilkinson and Cotterill were sacked after just 20 games in charge.

;般尼
In the summer of 2004 a decision by [[Burnley_F.C.|Burnley]] not to renew the contract of their manager, [[Stan_Ternent|Stan Ternent]], led to Cotterill being named as the new manager of the club. In his first season at the club they reached the third round of the [[Football_League_Cup|Football League Cup]], beating [[Aston_Villa_F.C.|Aston Villa]] 3–1 on the way. They also reached the fifth round of the FA Cup, beating [[Premier_League|Premier League]] side [[Liverpool_F.C.|Liverpool]] 1–0. After losing striker and captain [[Robbie_Blake|Robbie Blake]] and young midfielder [[Richard_Chaplow|Richard Chaplow]] they finished 13th in the [[Football_League_Championship|Championship]]. In [[2005–06_in_English_football|2005–06]] he led Burnley to a 17th-place finish, again having to sell his star striker, the club's leading goal scorer [[Ade_Akinbiyi|Ade Akinbiyi]] to [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United]] for £1.75 million.

The [[2006–07_in_English_football|2006–07]] season began well, with a series of wins. Cotterill also won the Championship Manager of the Month for October. However Burnley were dealt a blow in November when leading goalscorer [[Andy_Gray_(footballer_born_1977)|Andy Gray]] was sidelined until February. Akinbiyi was re-signed in the January transfer window, but the striker was unfit and failed to make an impact.

Cotterill eventually left the club on 8 November 2007 by mutual consent, after earning the title of longest serving manager in the league with three years seven months service. He left the club in a poor position having won just one game in ten.

In August 2008, Steve Cotterill was offered the chance to become the Head Coach and Technical Director of [[USL_First_Division|USL First Division]] [[Minnesota_Thunder|Minnesota Thunder]] after [[Amos_Magee|Amos Magee]] stepped down. Cotterill was offered a temporary seven-week contract with a view to a longer deal when the season ended. But because it would take two weeks to obtain a work permit, leaving only five weeks with Minnesota, Cotterill decided to turn this opportunity down.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.burnleyexpress.net/burnleyfc/Permit-steals-Cotterill39s-Thunder.4359468.jp |title=Permit steals Cotterill's Thunder |work=Burnley Express |author=Boden, Chris |date=5 August 2008 |accessdate=15 December 2008}}</ref>

;樸茨茅夫
Cotterill was appointed as manager of [[Portsmouth_F.C.|Portsmouth]] on 18 June 2010, with the club enduring ongoing financial difficulties. Cotterill played a key role in stabilising Portsmouth through some turbulent times which saw the club nearly go bust. Cotterill had performed a highly creditable job whilst working within complete uncertainty almost every day. This drew many suitors during the close season. 

Cotterill stuck with Portsmouth with his second full season at the club, promising a great deal more than the first. With new owners and the club now stable on and off the pitch, everyone involved with Portsmouth was determined for the club to kick on. This was not to be the case, however. The team transpired to win just two of their first 10 league matches in the Championship to leave them 19th in the table. However, the joint owner of Portsmouth, Roman Dubov, publicly backed him, insisting he was the right man for the club. 

It later became public knowledge that Nottingham Forest were interested in hiring Cotterill as their new manager after [[Steve_McClaren|Steve McClaren]] resigned from his post on 2 October 2011, following the club's poor start to the season and allegations of broken promises. Cotterill was granted permission to speak with Nottingham Forest on 14 October 2011 after compensation was agreed with Portsmouth.

Cotterill was appointed as manager on the 14 October 2011 on a three and half year deal. Winning his first two games in charge 2-0 against Middlesbrough and 2-1 against Blackpool.<ref>{{cite web|title=Steve Cotterill Named New Pompey Manager |url=http://www.portsmouthfc.co.uk/LatestNews/news/Steve-Cotterill-Named-New-Pompey-Manager-1037.aspx|publisher=Portsmouth FC|accessdate=18 June 2010|date=18 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title= Portsmouth appoint Steve Coterill as manager|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8747461.stm|publisher=[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]|accessdate=18 June 2010|date=18 June 2010}}</ref>
