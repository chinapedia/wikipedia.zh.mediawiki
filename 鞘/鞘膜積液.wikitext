'''鞘膜積液'''(英國英語：{{lang|en|hydrocoele}}、陰囊積水)表示[[漿液|漿液]](serous fluid)在[[体腔|体腔]]內的[[病理学|病變]]積累。

[[睾丸鞘膜積液|睾丸鞘膜積液]]是圍繞[[睾丸|睾丸]]的流體積累，並且是相當普遍的。它是由[[腹膜|腹膜]](peritoneum)纏繞著睾丸體的部分、稱為[[鞘膜|鞘膜]](tunica vaginalis)，所分泌之流體引起的。目前只要沒有疝氣，1歲以下小孩的鞘膜積液，通常會自行痊癒。原發性鞘膜積液可能發展在成年期、尤其是老年人，在炎熱的國家尤為常見，經由漿液性液體、大概是由受損的重吸收所引起的，這似乎是最主要的鞘膜積液的解釋，雖然原因還不清楚。 鞘膜積液也可是反复性地經由[[班氏絲蟲|班氏絲蟲]](Wuchereria bancrofti)或[[馬來絲蟲|馬來絲蟲]](Brugia malayi)的慢性[[感染|感染]]、或[[非洲|非洲]]和[[東南亞|東南亞]]地區的兩種蚊子傳播的寄生蟲等所引起的"插銷性[[腹股溝淋巴結|腹股溝淋巴系統]]"(Inguinal lymph node)的結果。因此，如果發病條件會是較瀰漫性的[[後遺症|後遺症]](sequela)之一部分、通常被稱為[[象皮病|象皮病]](elephantiasis)，這也影響在身體其它部分的[[淋巴系統|淋巴系統]]。

鞘膜積液可以通過四種方式產生：
<!--* by excessive production of fluid within the sac, e.g. secondary hydrocele.
* through defective absorption of fluid{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* by interference with lymphatic drainage of scrotal structures as in case of [[elephantiasis|elephantiasis]].
* by connection with a hernia of the peritoneal cavity in the congenital variety, which presents as hydrocele of the cord.-->

===原發性鞘膜積液===<!--
The swelling is soft and non-tender, large in size on examination and the testis cannot usually be [[Palpation|felt]]. The presence of fluid is demonstrated by trans illumination.  These hydrocoeles can reach a huge size, containing large amount of fluid, as these are painless and are often ignored. They are otherwise asymptomatic, other than size and weight, causing inconvenience. However the long continued presence of large hydroceles causes atrophy of testis due to compression or by obstructing blood supply. In most cases, the hydrocoele, when diagnosed early during complete [[physical_examination|physical examination]], are small and the testis can easily be palpated within a lax hydrocele but a [[Ultrasound_imaging|Ultrasound imaging]] is necessary to visualize the testis if the hydrocele sac is dense, to reveal the primary abnormality. But these can become large in cases when left unattended. Hydroceles are usually painless, as are [[testicular_tumor|testicular tumor]]s. A common method of diagnosing a hydrocele is by attempting to shine a strong light (transillumination) through the enlarged [[scrotum|scrotum]]. A hydrocele will usually pass light, while a [[tumor|tumor]] will not (except in the case of a malignancy with reactive hydrocele).-->

===繼發性鞘膜積液===<!--
Secondary hydrocele due to testicular diseases, can be the result of, [[cancer|cancer]], trauma (such as a [[hernia|hernia]]), or [[orchitis|orchitis]] (inflammation of [[testis|testis]]), and can also occur in infants undergoing [[peritoneal_dialysis|peritoneal dialysis]]. A hydrocele is not a cancer but it should be excluded clinically if a presence of a [[testicular_tumor|testicular tumor]] is suspected ,necessary in case of acute hydrocele in a young man as it may be due [[testicular_tumor|testicular tumor]]. Secondary hydrocele is most frequently associated with acute or chronic epididymo-orchitis. It is also seen with torsion of the testis and with some testicular tumors. A secondary hydrocele is usually lax and of moderate size: the underlying testis is palpable. A secondary hydrocele subsides when the primary lesion resolves.-->

===小兒鞘膜積液===<!--
In infants and children, a hydrocoele is usually an expression of a patent [[processus_vaginalis|processus vaginalis]] (PPV). The tunica and the processus vaginalis are distended to the inguinal ring but there is no connection with the peritoneal cavity.-->

===先天性鞘膜積液===<!--
The processus vaginalis is patent and connects with the general peritoneal cavity. The communication is usually too small to allow herniation of intra-abdominal contents. Digital pressure on the hydrocele does not usually empty it, but the hydrocele fluid may drain into the peritoneal cavity when the child is lying down. [[Ascites|Ascites]] or even ascitic tuberculous [[peritonitis|peritonitis]] should be considered if the swellings are bilateral.-->

===精索成囊鞘膜積液===<!--
There is a smooth oval swelling near the spermatic cord which is liable to be mistaken for an inguinal hernia. The swelling moves downwards and becomes less mobile if the testis is pulled gently downwards. Rarely, a hydrocoele develops in a remnant of the processus vaginalis somewhere along the course of the spermatic cord. This hydrocoele also transilluminates, and is known as an encysted hydrocoele of the cord. In females, a related region in females ,a multicystic hydrocoele of the [[canal_of_Nuck|canal of Nuck]]<ref>{{GPnotebook|-771358673}}</ref> sometimes presents as a swelling in the groin. It probably results from cystic degeneration of the round ligament. Unlike a hydrocele of the cord, a hydrocele of the canal of Nuck is always at least partially within the inguinal canal.

The accuracy of the diagnosis must be ascertained. Great care must be taken to differentiate a hydrocele from a scrotal hernia or tumor of the testicle. [[Ultrasound_imaging|Ultrasound imaging]] can be very useful in these cases. A hernia usually can be reduced, transmits a cough impulse, and is not translucent. A hydrocele cannot be reduced into the inguinal canal and gives no impulse on coughing unless a hernia is also present. In young children a hydrocele is often associated with a complete congenital type of hernial sac.-->

==臨床特徵及診斷==
A primary hydrocele is described as having the following characteristics:

*Transillumination positive 
*Fluctuation positive 
*Impulse on coughing negative (positive in infantile hydrocele) 
*Reducibility absent
*Testis cannot be palpated separately. (exception -  funicular hydrocele, encysted hydrocele)

==治療==<!--
Most hydroceles appearing in the first year of life seldom require treatment as they resolve without treatment. Hydroceles that persist after the first year or occur later in life which require treatment through open operation for removing [[surgery|surgically]],<ref>{{Zollinger's Atlas of Surgeries}}</ref> as these may have little tendency towards regression. Method of choice is open operation,<ref>{{Zollinger's Atlas of Surgeries}}</ref> under general or spinal [[anesthesia|anesthesia]] which is sufficient in adults. General [[anesthesia|anesthesia]] is the choice in children. Local infiltration [[anesthesia|anesthesia]] is not satisfactory because it cannot abolish abdominal pain due to traction on the [[spermatic_cord|spermatic cord]].<ref>{{Manual of Anesthesia for Out Patient Surgical Procedures}}</ref> If a testicular tumor is suspected, a hydrocele must not be aspirated as [[malignant_cells|malignant cells]] can be disseminated via the scrotal skin to its lymphatic field. This is excluded clinically by [[Ultrasonography|Ultrasonography]]. If a tumor is not present, the hydrocele, fluid can be aspirated with a [[Hypodermic_needle|needle]] and [[syringe|syringe]]. Clear straw colored fluid (mostly contains [[albumin|albumin]] and [[fibrinogen|fibrinogen]]). If the fluid is allowed to drain in a collecting vessel, it does not clot but can be coagulated if small amounts of [[blood|blood]] comes in contact with the damaged tissue. In long standing cases, hydrocele [[fluid|fluid]] may be opalescent with [[cholesterol|cholesterol]] and may contain crystals of [[tyrosine|tyrosine]] and a palpable normal testis confirms the diagnosis; other wise surgical exploration of testis is needed.<ref>{{Bailey and Love-Short Practice of Surgery}}</ref>

The scrotum should be supported post-operatively and ice bags should be placed to soothe pain. Regular changes of [[surgical_dressings|surgical dressings]], observation of drainage and looking for other complications may be necessary to prevent re-operation. In cases with presence of one or more complications, open operation with/without [[Orchidectomy|Orchidectomy]] is preferred depending on the complications.

'''Jaboulay’s procedure'''<ref>{{Bailey and Love-Short Practice of Surgery}}</ref>

After [[Pulmonary_aspiration|aspiration]] of a primary hydrocoele, fluid re accumulates over the following months and periodic aspiration or operation is needed. For younger patients, operation is usually preferred, whereas the elderly or unfit can have aspirations repeated whenever the hydrocoele becomes uncomfortably large. [[Sclerotherapy|Sclerotherapy]] is an alternative; after aspiration, 6% aqueous phenol (10-20 ml) together with 1% [[lidocaine|lidocaine]] for analgesia can be injected and this often inhibits re accumulation. Several treatments may be necessary. Aspiration of the hydrocele contents and injection with sclerosing agents sometimes with [[Tetracyclines|Tetracyclines]] is effective{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} but it can be very painful. These alternative treatments are generally regarded as unsatisfactory treatment because of the high incidence of recurrences and the frequent necessity for repetition of the procedure.-->

==併發症==<!--
* Rupture usually occurs as a result of trauma but may be spontaneous. On rare occasions cure results after the fluid has been absorbed.
* Herniation of the hydrocele sac through the dartos muscle sometimes occurs in long-standing cases.
* Transformation into a haematocele occurs if there is spontaneous bleeding into the sac or as a result of trauma. Acute haemorrhage into the tunica vaginalis sometimes results from testicular trauma and it may be difficult without exploration to decide whether the testis has been ruptured. If the haematocele is not drained, a clotted haematocele usually results.
* The sac may calcify. Clotted hydrocele may result from a slow spontaneous ooze of blood into the tunica vaginalis. It is usually painless and by the time the patient seeks help, it may be difficult to be sure that the swelling is not due to a testicular tumour. Indeed a tumour may present as a haematocele.
* Occasionally, severe infection can be introduced by aspiration. Simple aspiration, however, often may be used as a temporary measure in those cases where surgery is contraindicated or must be postponed.
* Postherniorrhaphy hydrocele is a relatively rare complication of inguinal hernia repair. It is possibly due to interruption to the lymphatics draining the scrotal contents.

Complications are often diagnosed post operatively which can be differentiated through [[Duplex_ultrasound|duplex ultrasound scanning]], observed not only until 24 to 48 hours for early complications such as drainage, infection, formation of haematocele, rupture etc. but also for 1 to 6 weeks during [[Ambulatory_care|follow-up]] on [[out-patient|out-patient]] basis.-->
