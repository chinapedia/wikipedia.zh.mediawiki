'''胡格利河''' （[[孟加拉语|孟加拉语]] হুগলী, Huglī；英语：Hooghly River）位于印度，是[[恒河|恒河]]下游的一条分流，长约260千米，它在Baharampur市附近从恒河分叉出去，向南穿越 [[西孟加拉邦|西孟加拉邦]]，流经双子城[[加尔各答|加尔各答]]和[[豪拉|豪拉]]，最后注入[[孟加拉湾|孟加拉湾]]。它最有名的2条支流是Damodar河和Rupnarayan河。

<!-- It is an essential lifeline for the people of Kolkata. The fish from the river are important to the local economy. The river's presence is one of the reasons chosen by the [[British_India|British]] to settle there. The French colony at [[Chandannagar|Chandannagar]] on the Hooghly was once the rival of British Calcutta, but was eclipsed by Calcutta in the colonial wars of the [[18th_century|18th century]].  In 1974 the [[Farakka_Barrage|Farakka Barrage]] began diverting water into the Hooghly during its dry season so as to reduce Calcutta's port silting difficulties.  The modern container port of [[Haldia|Haldia]], on the intersection of lower Hooghly and Haldi River, now carries much of the region's maritime trade.One new port will be built in the deep sea to reduce load on Kolkata port.

胡格利河valley was the most important industrial area of erstwhile state of Bengal. Due to declining jute industry, the prime industry of this region, it lost its glory. But still it is one of the biggest industrial areas of India. Except Kolkata and Howrah it has number of small cities which forms the Greater Kolkata Agglomeration, the second biggest Indian city and former capital.

Several bridges run over the Hooghly at Kolkata; the [[Howrah_Bridge|Howrah Bridge]], the [[Vidyasagar_Setu|Vidyasagar Setu]] and the [[Vivekananda_Setu|Vivekananda Setu]] bridges.

The town of [[Hooghly|Hooghly]] is located on the river, in the [[Hooghly_(district)|district of the same name]]. The origins of the name are uncertain, whether the city or the river was named first.

The nexus formed by the Hooghly River (Ganga) and the Bay of Bengal, called ‘Ganga Sagar’. This is a sacred place for Hindus. A dip in the ocean, where the river drains into the sea is considered to be of great religious significance particularly on the Makara Sankranti day when the sun makes a transition to Capricorn from Sagittarius and this place becomes home to vast fairs, drawing visitors and recluses from all over the state. -->

<!-- ==Hugli tidal bore== -->
<!-- The tide runs rapidly on the Hugli, and produces a remarkable example of the fluvial phenomenon known as a "[[tidal_bore|tidal bore]]." This consists of the head-wave of the advancing tide, hemmed in where the estuary narrows suddenly into the river, and often exceeds 7 ft. in height. It is felt as high up as [[Calcutta|Calcutta]], and frequently destroys small boats. The difference from the lowest point of low-water in the dry season to the highest point of high-water in the rains is reported to be 20 ft. 10 in. The greatest mean rise of tide, about 16 ft., takes place in March, April or May - with a declining range during the rainy season to a mean of 10 ft., and a minimum during freshets of 3 ft. 6 in. -->
