'''聯合鐵路公司'''（{{lang-en|Consolidated Rail Corporation}}），一般簡稱'''Conrail'''，是存在於1976年至1999年之間的美國一級鐵路公司，營運於美國東北部。Conrail一詞來自於公司名稱中的"consolidated"與"rail" 。

美國聯邦政府成立Conrail以承接許多家破產鐵路公司之可能獲利的路線，包括{{link-en|賓夕法尼亞中央運輸|Penn Central Transportation Company}}與{{link-en|伊利雷克旺那鐵路|Erie Lackawanna Railway}}。由於法令與管理的改變，聯合鐵路公司在1980年代開始獲利，並在1987年轉手給私人投資者。1997年美國東部其餘兩家一級鐵路公司[[CSX運輸|CSX運輸]]與[[諾福克南方鐵路|諾福克南方鐵路]]同意瓜分聯合鐵路公司，結果使得美國東部的鐵路貨運又回到了1968年[[賓夕法尼亞鐵路|賓夕法尼亞鐵路]]與[[紐約中央鐵路|紐約中央鐵路]]合併成賓夕法尼亞中央鐵路之前的情形。在{{link-en|地表運輸委員會|Surface Transportation Board}}同意後，CSX運輸與諾福克南方鐵路在1998年8月接管聯合鐵路公司，1999年6月1日起各自開始營運其所分配到的聯合鐵路公司路線。

聯合鐵路公司仍然以兩家公司共有的子公司方式存續，相對應於CSX運輸與諾福克南方鐵路所擁有的聯合鐵路資產比例，CSX運輸擁有42%股權，諾福克南方鐵路擁有58%股權。不過兩家公司擁有同等的投票權。聯合鐵路所剩下的主要資產是在[[紐澤西州|紐澤西州]]、[[費城|費城]]、[[底特律|底特律]]三地的共同資產。在這三個地方，由CSX與諾福克南方鐵路服務貨運客戶，該兩家公司付費給聯合鐵路以維護路線，並由聯合鐵路進行車輛調度與終端車站服務。聯合鐵路也仍保留多種支援服務，例如路線保養以及訓練業務，還擁有{{link-en|印第安那港帶鐵路|Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad}}的51%股權。

==History==

===Context: 1973–1976===
In the years leading to 1973, the freight railroad system of the U.S. was collapsing. Although government-funded [[Amtrak|Amtrak]] took over [[intercity_rail|intercity passenger service]] in 1971, railroad companies continued to lose money due to extensive government regulations, expensive and excessive labor cost, competition from other transportation modes, declining industrial business, and other factors.<ref name="Stover">{{cite book |title=American Railroads |last=Stover |first=John F. |authorlink= |year=1997 |edition = 2nd |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-77658-3 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R4vjgmic44QC&source=gbs_navlinks_s |accessdate=}}</ref>{{rp|226ff}} 

Its largest Eastern railroad, the [[Penn_Central_Railroad|Penn Central Railroad]], had declared bankruptcy in 1970, after less than three years of existence. Formed in 1968 by the merger of the [[New_York_Central_Railroad|New York Central Railroad]] and [[Pennsylvania_Railroad|Pennsylvania Railroad]] (and supplemented in 1969 by the [[New_York,_New_Haven_and_Hartford_Railroad|New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]]), the PC was created with almost no plans to merge the varied corporate cultures, and the resulting company was a hopelessly entangled mess.<ref name="Stover" />{{rp|233–234}} At its lowest point, PC was losing over $1 million a day and trains were becoming lost all over the railroad.<ref name="American-Rails">American-Rails.com. {{cite web|title=Conrail, The Consolidated Rail Corporation|url=http://www.american-rails.com/conrail.html|accessdate=2010-12-17}}</ref>  

In 1972, [[Hurricane_Agnes|Hurricane Agnes]] damaged the rundown Northeast railway network and threatened the solvency of other railroads, including the somewhat more solvent [[Erie_Lackawanna|Erie Lackawanna]] (EL).  In mid-1973, officials with the bankrupt Penn Central threatened to [[liquidate|liquidate]] and cease operations by year's end if they did not receive government aid by October 1. This threat to U.S. freight and passenger traffic galvanized the [[United_States_Congress|Congress]] to quickly create a bill to [[nationalize|nationalize]] the bankrupt railroads. The [[Association_of_American_Railroads|Association of American Railroads]], which opposed nationalization, submitted an alternate proposal for a government-funded private company. Judge Fullam forced the Penn Central to operate into 1974, when, on January 2, after threatening a [[veto|veto]], President [[Richard_Nixon|Richard Nixon]] signed the [[Regional_Rail_Reorganization_Act|Regional Rail Reorganization Act]] of 1973 into law.<ref>Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973, Pub.L. 93-236, 87 Stat. 985, {{USC|45|741}}. Approved 1974-01-02. Note: The approved bill was also called the "Northeast Region Rail Services Act." Section 1 of Pub.L. 93–236 provided that the law may be cited as "Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973."

The 3R Act also formed the [[United_States_Railway_Association|United States Railway Association]], another [[government_corporation|government corporation]], taking over the powers of the [[Interstate_Commerce_Commission|Interstate Commerce Commission]] with respect to allowing the bankrupt railroads to abandon unprofitable lines.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Keeffe |first1=Arthur John |date=July 1974 |title=Current Legal Literature: Hear That Whistle Down the Line? |journal=ABA Journal |publisher=American Bar Association |volume=60 |issue= |pages=860 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yr9X6w-dp40C&lpg=PA860&dq=%22united%20states%20railway%20association%22&pg=PA860#v=onepage&q=%22united%20states%20railway%20association%22&f=false |doi= }}</ref> The USRA was incorporated February 1, 1974, and [[Edward_G._Jordan|Edward G.

[[File:Conrail_FSP.jpg|thumb]] and [[Reading_Company|Reading Company]] out of Conrail.]]
Under the 3R Act, the USRA was to create a "Final System Plan" to decide which lines should be included in the new Consolidated Rail Corporation. Unlike most railroad consolidations, only the designated lines were to be taken over. Other lines would be sold to Amtrak, various state governments, transportation agencies, and solvent railroads. The few remaining lines were to remain with the old companies along with all previously abandoned lines, many stations, and all non-rail related properties, thus converting most of the old companies into solvent property holding companies. The plan was unveiled July 26, 1975, consisting of lines from Penn Central and six other companies—the [[Ann_Arbor_Railroad_(1895-1976)|Ann Arbor Railroad]] (bankrupt 1973), [[Erie_Lackawanna_Railway|Erie Lackawanna Railway]] (1972), [[Lehigh_Valley_Railroad|Lehigh Valley Railroad]] (1970), [[Reading_Company|Reading Company]] (1971), [[Central_Railroad_of_New_Jersey|Central Railroad of New Jersey]] (1967) and [[Lehigh_and_Hudson_River_Railway|Lehigh and Hudson River Railway]] (1972). Controlled railroads and jointly owned railroads such as [[Pennsylvania-Reading_Seashore_Lines|Pennsylvania-Reading Seashore Lines]] were also included ('''See''' [[list_of_railroads_transferred_to_Conrail|list of railroads transferred to Conrail]] for a full list).<ref name="USRA Fact">U.S. Railway Association (USRA), Washington, DC (1975-02-26).

The EL had been formed in 1960 as a merger of the [[Erie_Railroad|Erie Railroad]] and [[Delaware,_Lackawanna_and_Western_Railroad|Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad]]. It too was bankrupt, but was somewhat stronger financially than the others. It was ruled reorganizable under [[Chapter_77|Chapter 77]] on April 30, 1974 (as had the [[Boston_and_Maine_Railroad|Boston and Maine Railroad]]), but on January 9, 1975, with no end to its losses in sight, its trustees reconsidered and asked for inclusion. The Final System Plan assigned a major section of the EL, from northern [[New_Jersey|New Jersey]] west to northeast [[Ohio|Ohio]], to be sold to the [[Chessie_System|Chessie System]], which would help spur [[competition|competition]] in Conrail's territory. Chessie however could not reach an agreement with EL [[labor_union|labor union]]s, and in February 1976 announced that it would not be buying the EL section. The USRA hurriedly assigned large amounts of [[trackage_rights|trackage rights]] to the [[Delaware_and_Hudson_Railway|Delaware and Hudson Railway]], allowing it to compete in the [[Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania|Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and [[Washington,_D.C.|Washington, D.C.]], markets.{{cn|date = March 2014}}

The [[Michigan|State of Michigan]] decided to keep the full [[Ann_Arbor_Railroad_(1895-1976)|Ann Arbor Railroad]], of which Conrail would run only the southernmost portion, operational. Michigan bought it and the whole line was operated by Conrail for several years until it was sold to a [[Short-line_railroad|short line]].{{cn|date = March 2014}}

===Operation: 1976–1986===
Conrail was incorporated in Pennsylvania on October 25, 1974, and operations began April 1, 1976. The theory was that if the service was improved through increased [[capital_investment|capital investment]], the economic basis of the railroad would be improved. During its first seven years, Conrail proved to be highly unprofitable, despite receiving billions of dollars of assistance from Congress. The corporation declared enormous losses on its federal income tax returns from 1976 through 1982, resulting in an accumulated net operating loss of $2.2 billion during that period. Congress once again reacted with support by passing the [[Northeast_Rail_Service_Act|Northeast Rail Service Act]] of 1981 (NERSA),<ref>Northeast Rail Service Act of 1981, Pub. L. 97-35, {{Usc-title-chap|45|20}}, 1981-08-13.</ref> which amended portions of the 3R Act by exempting Conrail from liability for any state taxes<ref>{{USC|45|727(c)}}</ref> and requiring the [[United_States_Secretary_of_Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]] to make arrangements for the sale of the government's interest in Conrail.<ref>{{USC|45|761}}.</ref> After NERSA was implemented, Conrail, under the aggressive leadership of L. Stanley Crane began to improve and reported taxable income between $2 million and $314 million each year from 1983 through 1986.

Although Conrail's government-funded rebuilding of the dilapidated infrastructure and [[rolling_stock|rolling stock]] it inherited from its six predecessors succeeded by the end of the 1970s in improving the physical condition of tracks, [[diesel_locomotive|locomotives]], and [[freight_car|freight car]]s, the fundamental economic regulatory issues remained, and Conrail continued to post losses of as much as $1 million a day. Conrail management, recognizing the need for more regulatory freedoms to address the economic issues, were among the parties lobbying for what became the [[Staggers_Act|Staggers Act]] of 1980, which significantly loosened the [[Interstate_Commerce_Commission|Interstate Commerce Commission]]'s rigid [[economic_control|economic control]] of the rail industry. This allowed Conrail and other carriers the opportunity to become profitable and strengthen their finances.<ref>Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub. L. 96-448, {{USStat|94|1895}}. Approved 1980-10-14.</ref>

The Staggers Act allowed the setting of rates that would recover capital and operating cost (fully allocated cost recovery) by each and every route mile the railroad operated. There would be no more cross-subsidization of costs between route-miles (that is, revenue on profitable route segments were not used to subsidize routes where rates were set at intermodal parity, yet still did recover fully allocated costs). Finally, where current and/or future traffic projections showed that profitable volumes of traffic would not return, the railroads were allowed to abandon those routes, shippers and passengers to other modes of transportation.  With the Staggers Act, railroads, including Conrail, were freed from the requirement to operate services with open-ended losses for the public convenience and necessity of those who chose rail services as their mode of transportation.

[[File:CR_18065_IN_Porter.jpg|thumb]] 18065 brings up the rear of a local freight passing [[Porter,_Indiana|Porter]], Indiana, in the early 1990s.]]
Conrail began turning a profit by 1981, the result of the Staggers Act freedoms and its own managerial improvements under the leadership of L. Stanley Crane, who had been chief executive officer of the [[Southern_Railway_(U.S.)|Southern Railway]]. While the Staggers Act helped immensely in allowing all railroads to more easily abandon unprofitable rail lines and set its own freight rate, it was under Crane's leadership that Conrail truly became a profitable operation.  Soon after Crane took office in 1981 he shed another 4,400 miles from the Conrail system in the following two years, which accounted for only 1% of the railroad's overall traffic and 2% of its profits while saving it millions of dollars in maintenance costs.<ref name="American-Rails"/> NERSA relieved Conrail of its requirement to provide [[commuter_rail|commuter service]] on the [[Northeast_Corridor|Northeast Corridor]], further improving its finances.

After considerable debate in Congress, the [[Conrail_Privatization_Act|Conrail Privatization Act]] of 1986 was signed into law by [[Ronald_Reagan|President Reagan]] on October 21, 1986.<ref>Conrail Privatization Act, Pub. L. 99–509, title IV, subtitle A (§4001 et seq.), Oct. 21, 1986, {{USStat|100|1892}}, {{USC|45|1301}} et seq.{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> The then-largest [[initial_public_offering|initial public offering]] in US history came on March 26, 1987 when Conrail's stock, worth $1.65 billion, was sold to private investors.<ref>{{cite news |title=85% U.S. Stake in Conrail Sold for $1.6 Billion |first=James |last=Sterngold |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/03/27/business/85-us-stake-in-conrail-sold-for-1.6-billion.html?scp=1&sq=conrail&st=nyt |newspaper=New York Times |date=1987-03-27 |accessdate=17 March 2011}}</ref>

====Commuter rail operations====
Conrail inherited the [[commuter_rail|commuter rail]] operations of its predecessor lines, and operated them until 1983, when these services were transferred to state or metropolitan transit authorities.  Except for MARC, the transit authorities purchased the track and right-of-way on which their commuter operations ran, leaving Conrail freight operations as a tenant.

===Breakup 1997–1999===
With Conrail's increasing success, its two eastern rail competitors, [[CSX_Transportation|CSX Transportation]] and [[Norfolk_Southern_Railway|Norfolk Southern Railway]], engaged in a [[Takeover|takeover battle]] to control the railroad and expand their systems. In 1997, however, the two railroads struck a [[compromise|compromise]] agreement to jointly acquire Conrail and split most of its assets between them, with Norfolk Southern acquiring a larger portion of the Conrail network via a larger stock buyout. Under the final agreement approved by the [[Surface_Transportation_Board|Surface Transportation Board]], Norfolk Southern acquired 58 percent of Conrail's assets, including roughly 6,000 Conrail route miles, and CSX received 42 percent of Conrail's assets, including about 3,600 route miles.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/david-r-goode |title=answers.com |access-date=2014-12-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026052322/http://www.answers.com/topic/david-r-goode |archive-date=2012-10-26 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>

The buyout was approved by the [[Surface_Transportation_Board|Surface Transportation Board]] (successor agency to the [[Interstate_Commerce_Commission|Interstate Commerce Commission]]) and took place on August 22, 1998. Under the control of lawyer-turned CEO [[Tim_O'Toole_(businessman)|Tim O'Toole]], the lines were transferred to two newly formed [[Limited_liability_company|limited liability companies]], to be subsidiaries of Conrail but leased to CSX and Norfolk Southern, respectively [[New_York_Central_Lines|New York Central Lines]] (NYC) and [[Pennsylvania_Lines_LLC|Pennsylvania Lines]] (PRR). The NYC and PRR [[reporting_mark|reporting mark]]s, which had passed to Conrail, were also transferred to the new companies, and NS also acquired the CR reporting mark. Operations under CSX and NS began June 1, 1999.

As the names indicated, CSX acquired the former [[New_York_Central_Railroad|New York Central Railroad]] main line from [[New_York_City|New York City]] and [[Boston,_Massachusetts|Boston, Massachusetts]] to [[Cleveland,_Ohio|Cleveland, Ohio]], and the former [[Cleveland,_Cincinnati,_Chicago_and_St._Louis_Railway|Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway]] (NYC Big Four) line to [[Indianapolis,_Indiana|Indianapolis, Indiana]] (continuing west to [[East_St._Louis,_Illinois|East St. Louis, Illinois]] on a former [[Pittsburgh,_Cincinnati,_Chicago_and_St._Louis_Railroad|Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad]] (PRR Panhandle Route line), while Norfolk Southern got the former [[Pennsylvania_Railroad|Pennsylvania Railroad]] main line and [[Cleveland_and_Pittsburgh_Railroad|Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad]] from [[Jersey_City,_New_Jersey|Jersey City, New Jersey]] to Cleveland, and the rest of the former NYC main line west to [[Chicago,_Illinois|Chicago, Illinois]]. Thus the Conrail "X" was neatly split in two, CSX getting one diagonal from Boston to St. Louis and Norfolk Southern the other from New York to Chicago. The two lines cross at a bridge southeast of downtown Cleveland ({{Coord|41.447|N|81.627|W|}}), where the former Cleveland and Pittsburgh Railroad crosses over the NYC's former [[Cleveland_Short_Line_Railway|Cleveland Short Line Railway]] around the south side of Cleveland.

In three major metropolitan areas - North Jersey, South Jersey/Philadelphia, and Detroit - [[Conrail_Shared_Assets_Operations|Conrail Shared Assets Operations]] continues to serve as a terminal operating company owned by both CSX and NS. The Conrail Shared Assets Operations arrangement was a concession made to federal regulators who were concerned about the lack of competition in certain rail markets and logistical problems associated with the breaking up the Conrail operations as they existed in densely populated areas with many local customers. The smaller Conrail operation that exists today serves rail freight customers in these markets on behalf of its two owners. A fourth area, the former [[Monongahela_Railway|Monongahela Railway]] in southwest [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], was originally owned jointly by the [[Baltimore_and_Ohio_Railroad|Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], [[Pennsylvania_Railroad|Pennsylvania Railroad]] and [[Pittsburgh_and_Lake_Erie_Railroad|Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad]]. Conrail absorbed the company in 1993, and assigned [[trackage_rights|trackage rights]] to CSX, the successor to the B&O and P&LE. With the Conrail breakup, those lines are owned by NS, but the CSX trackage rights are still in place.

==Locomotives==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2014}}
[[File:CR_6114_1993,_Altoona,_Pennsylvania.jpg|thumb]], leads a train westbound out of [[Altoona,_Pennsylvania|Altoona, Pennsylvania]].]]
Although Conrail was divided between Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation in 1999, a few locomotives
still bear its name, albeit with the current railroad's number "patched" over the original Conrail number. Many CR units have similar features such as, "Bright Future" blue paint, flashing ditch lights, and Leslie RS-3L horns. Another key spotting feature is ditchlights mounted under the locomotive's front deck. This is a preference different from Norfolk Southern, who orders their locomotives with the lights above the deck. Marker lights, or class lights, were also a preference of Conrail. Most Conrail engines still have marker lights on CSX, while NS opted to remove them. All Conrail locomotives that went to CSX are now re-painted into CSX colors. Currently, only two [[GE_C40-8|GE C40-8]]'s are still in Conrail paint. One is under rebuilding to be fitted with a Crescent Cab at Altoona, PA's [[Altoona_Works|Altoona Works]]. Conrail was the only railroad to receive EMD SD80MACs (although the railroad Chicago North & Western, reporting marks CNW, were originally supposed to receive SD80MACS with the marker lights. But when the railroad merged with Union Pacific, reporting marks UP, the order was declined) and were separated evenly between CSX & NS. Conrail had a different scheme for these locomotives and also the SD70MAC, with a large white, cone shaped line on the front, bearing "Conrail Quality". The SD70MACs weren't fitted with marker lights, as it would be useless when given to NS & CSX. This goes along with the standard-cab SD70, Conrail's final order of locomotives, as they were in Norfolk Southern's preferred numbering (the 2500 series). These have all been repainted into their respective owner's colors, but as of September 22nd, 2014, it has been announced that Norfolk Southern has entered an agreement with CSX Transportation to purchase the remaining SD80MACs. It remains to be seen if they will rejoin the fleet at the South Fork, Pennsylvania yard where the 13 on NS are based. However, if NS does receive the SD80MACs, they will not have the marker lights. They will be blotched out just like all of the other former Conrail widecabs. The SD80MACs would become SD70ACe's as extensive power for the power-shortaged railroad.

==Signals==
[[File:NS_Buffalo-Line-Signal-304-3042-APPROACH.jpg|thumb]]]]
Since Conrail acquired many separate railways, with the North American railway signalling system not standardized, operators needed to qualify on as many as seven different signalling systems.  The varying systems include, but are not limited to, the PRR [[North_American_railroad_signals#Position_light|position light signals]], the NYC [[North_American_railroad_signals#Searchlight|searchlight signals]], and the EL tri-light{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} signals. Most of the existing technologies were defined by the [[Northeast_Operating_Rules_Advisory_Committee|Northeast Operating Rules Advisory Committee]] (NORAC).<ref>http://www.railroad-signaling.com. [http://www.railroad-signaling.com/aspects.html "Signal Aspects."] Reference chart of NORAC signals with illustrations. Accessed 2010-11-21.</ref> Conrail had its own  tri-light signal modernization program that was applied to many routes.  Today, most Northeastern railroads associated with former Conrail assets are working towards standardization of all systems as [[North_American_railroad_signals#Vertical_color_light|vertical color light signals]].  Meanwhile, Amtrak uses a modified version of the PRR position light signals called "Position Color Lights".
