Drug addicts are just one of the Scientologists’ targets for recruitment. The offer of care and healing through techniques derived from dianetics is only a come-on. The detoxification of the patient by means of “dianetics purification” is more a matter of manipulation, through the general weakening that it causes; it is a way of brainwashing the subject. Frequently convicted for illegal practice of medicine, violence, fraud and slander, the Scientologists have more and more trouble getting people to accept their techniques as effective health measures, as they like to claim. They recommend their purification processes to eliminate X-rays and nuclear radiation, and to treat goiter and warts, hypertension and psoriasis, hemorrhoids and myopia. . . why would anyone find that hard to swallow? Scientology has built a library of several hundreds of volumes of writings exalting the effects of purification, and its disciples spew propaganda based on irresponsible medical writings by doctors who are more interested in the support provided by Scientology than in their patients’ well-being. On the other hand, responsible scientific reviews have long since “eliminated” dianetics and purification from the lists of therapies — relegating them to the great bazaar of medical fraud. ... Medical charlatans do not base their claims on scientific proof but, quite to the contrary, on peremptory assertions — the kind of assertions that they challenge when they come out of the mouths of those who defend “real” medicine. }}</ref>」，

In his letter to Trish Bascom, director of health programs for the San Francisco Unified School District, Heilig said five independent experts in the field of drug abuse had helped him evaluate Narconon's curriculum. ... "One of our reviewers opined that 'this (curriculum) reads like a high school science paper pieced together from the Internet, and not very well at that,' " Heilig wrote Bascom. "Another wrote that 'my comments will be brief, as this proposal hardly merits detailed analysis.' Another stated, 'As a parent, I would not want my child to participate in this kind of 'education.' " Heilig's team evaluated Narconon against a recent study by Rodney Skager, a professor emeritus at UCLA's Graduate School of Education and Information Studies, describing what good anti-drug programs should offer students. "We concurred that ... the Narconon materials focus on some topics of lesser importance to the exclusion of best knowledge and practices," Heilig wrote, and that the curriculum contained "factual errors in basic concepts such as physical and mental effects, addiction and even spelling."|accessdate=7 September 2012}}</ref>

===詐騙醫療保險===

2013年4月，美國喬治亞州保險業監理專員與地檢處人員突擊搜查當地那可拿中心，保險專員在調查過程中表示：「我們有可靠資料指出，那可拿正在詐騙醫療保險。」一名戒治者家人說那可拿給保險公司的賬單出現從未給予的治 療，而賬單上的醫生說從沒有見過戒治者。<ref name=ajc1>{{cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local/search-warrants-executed-at-narconon-drug-rehab-cl/nXYzn/|title=Search warrants executed at Narconon drug rehab clinic|publisher=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=2013-04-26}}</ref>

==反毒宣導==
那可拿的反毒宣導因爲滲入了山達基信仰和有不正確資料，在世界各地被拒絕。

那可拿毫無科學基礎地四處宣稱服下的藥物將永遠囤積在人體的脂肪中，但只要去洗[[三溫暖|三溫暖]]且使用[[維他命|維他命]]。醫學專家嚴正駁斥這樣的謬論，藥物並不會儲存在脂肪中就算有也是十分微量的，在統計學上無顯著意義，更不可能透過洗三溫暖「催汗」來代謝藥物。

新生活教育中心在花蓮看守所開始推行可明納計劃，在臺灣翻譯爲無犯罪計劃，直至2009年成立[[無犯罪促進會|無犯罪促進會]]，專門替受刑人服務。新生活教育中心亦推行那可拿的一套反毒計劃，早期曾經與淨耀法師創立的淨化文化協會合作到學校宣導，事實上現在兩者是沒有關係的機構，反毒宣導也不相同。宣傳和推銷新生活教育中心的機構，先後有2008年成立的那可拿育成顧問社，2013年的中華民國新生活教育推廣協會，還有新生活教育協會等。

==採用教材==

該促進會所採用的教材稱為無犯罪計畫，是由四個課程所組成的：

#溝通與面對能力課程，在山達基教會內稱爲[[訓練例程_(山達基)|演練常式]]
#[[學習技術|學習技術]]
#[[快樂之道|快樂之道]]課程
#社會人格及反社會人格者課程

那可拿教材並沒有毒品和對成癮者身體影響的基本醫學常識，課程取材自山達基教義，甚至完全相同。

快樂之道提倡真實是相對的，這些相對哲學現今被稱為[[詭辯|詭辯]]，早在二千多年前已被[[蘇格拉底|蘇格拉底]]和他的弟子否定。<ref>{{Cite book

英國社會學家羅·伊瓦利斯評論說，學習技術是灌輸山達基的一個關鍵因素，用以協助把握教義緩慢的人。其基本原則是，不理解或不同意一篇文章的意義，不是由於文章的錯誤-比如它是荒謬的-而 是因為讀者不理解一個詞或概念。讀者學習懷疑自己的判斷；學習在羅恩賀伯特的寫作中找一點意義，毫無疑問他的作品大部分是神化的; 或學習默許接受一半難以理解的聲明，希望日後一切都會明確化。極端乏味的「清字」，進一步停頓或抑制個人的關鍵思想，並使讀者準備接受，賀伯特的學說本質 是有意義的。<ref>{{cite book|last=Wallis|first=Roy |title=The Road to Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology|pages=231–232|publisher=Heinemann|location=London|isbn=0435829165}}</ref>

山達基經文[[戴尼提|戴尼提]]裏說有2.5%的人類是有反社會人格，因爲沒有足夠的資源打救他們，在山達基世界裏可以把他們默默地除去。而人生低潮如上課程沒有進展，必然是身邊遇到反社會人格者，要把他們找出來隔離，親友也要斷絕。

==歷史==
那可拿成立於66年2月19日，其基礎是[[羅恩·賀伯特|羅恩·賀伯特]]的“思考的原理”一書，為一個毒品康復計劃，用於美國亞利桑那州監獄的吸毒者。那可拿原來不是指一個組織，是指戒毒程序。它的創始人是威廉·貝尼特斯，前[[亞利桑那|亞利桑那]]州立監獄囚犯，曾犯了與毒品有關連的罪行。<ref>Narconon [http://www.narconon.org/about_benitez.htm The Origins of the Narconon Program] (accessed June 4, 2006)</ref> 他的工作得到了山達基創始人賀伯特支持，並在1972年創辦那可拿組織。<ref name="About Hubbard">Narconon [http://www.narconon.org/about_lronhubbard.htm "L. Ron Hubbard and the Narconon program"] (accessed June 4, 2006)</ref>  在1973年，那可拿程序變革，在使用維生素和礦物質補充劑的同時，也用了改編自山達基礎課程的培訓程序。<ref name="About Hubbard" />

===那可拿與山達基教===

在早期，那可拿直接使用山達基課程，該組織並由山達基人員直接管理。但當記者或政治家提出了那可拿與山達基的聯繫，該組織一再處於爭議的中心。山達基教會不僅是有嚴重的公眾形象問題，那可拿與山達基的聯繫更出現了憲法上的疑問，政府機構贊助宗教附屬組織是不適當的。 當那可拿處理程序被宣稱爲醫學上不健全的，這些爭論進一步加劇，有許多指控那可拿向山達基教會提供了資金籌集和招募計劃。<ref name="Experts challenge">

為了針對他們被視作一個教會的營銷工具，那可拿開發出了自己的非宗教教材。這些變化通過了數版本，產生了當前的“新生活程式”。雖然這個程式是非常類似源本的山達基課程，但那可拿堅持認為，這完全是“非宗教”的性質，更幾乎沒有在其出版物上提到山達基。可是，至少有一個那可拿組織介紹自己為FSMs，一個山達基外圍職員的縮寫。<ref>

1999年，山達基在[[佛羅里達州|佛羅里達州]]、清水灣，試圖將那可拿毒品教育計劃，引入皮內拉斯縣學區。 聽證會後，在這個問題上，學校區委員會拒絕讓學生參加這一項反毒品計劃，因為計劃的基礎是山達基創始人羅恩·賀伯特的教誨，在學校教學生什麼“情緒等級表”是不恰當的反毒課程。<ref>
