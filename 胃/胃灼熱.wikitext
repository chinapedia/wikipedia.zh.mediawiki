==鑑別診斷==<!--
[[Myocardial_infarction|Heart attack]] symptoms and esophageal symptoms can be very similar, as the heart and esophagus use the same [[nerve|nerve]] supply.<ref name=Cardiac09>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kato H, Ishii T, Akimoto T, Urita Y, Sugimoto M |title=Prevalence of linked angina and gastroesophageal reflux disease in general practice |journal=World J.

Because of the dangers inherent in an overlooked diagnosis of heart attack, cardiac disease must be considered from the first in patients with unexplained chest pain.  Patients with chest pain related to GERD are difficult to distinguish clinically from those with chest pain due to cardiac conditions. Each condition can mimic the signs and symptomatic findings of the other.  Further medical investigation, such as imaging, is often necessary and exigent.

As many as 30% of chest pain patients undergoing cardiac catheterization have findings which do not account for their chest discomfort, and are often defined as having "atypical chest pain" or chest pain of undetermined origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwgi.org/guidelines/ch_03/ch03txt.htm|title=Heartburn and Regurgitation|date=|accessdate=2010-06-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110116013416/http://www.uwgi.org/guidelines/ch_03/ch03txt.htm|archive-date=2011-01-16|dead-url=yes}}</ref> According to data recorded in several studies based on ambulatory pH and pressure monitoring, it is estimated that 25% to 50% of these patients have evidence of abnormal GERD.

Heartburn can be caused by several conditions and a preliminary diagnosis of GERD is based on additional signs and symptoms. The chest pain caused by GERD has a distinct 'burning' sensation, occurs after eating or at night, and worsens when a person lies down or bends over.<ref name=Mayo>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/heartburn-gerd/DS00095 The Mayo Clinic Heartburn page]. Accessed May 18, 2010</ref> It also is common in pregnant women, and may be triggered by consuming food in large quantities, or specific foods containing certain spices, high fat content, or high acid content.<ref name=Mayo/><ref name=Medline>[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/heartburn.html The MedlinePlus Heartburn page]. Accessed May 18, 2010</ref>  If the chest pain is suspected to be heartburn, patients may undergo an [[upper_gastrointestinal_series|upper GI series]] to confirm the presence of acid reflux.<ref name=Medline/><ref>[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/uppergi/ National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse (NDDIC): Upper GI Series]. Accessed May 18, 2010</ref>
Heartburn or chest pain after eating or drinking and combined with difficulty swallowing may indicate esophageal spasms.<ref>[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/esophageal-spasms/DS00763/DSECTION=symptoms MedlinePlus: Esophageal spasms]. Accessed April 18, 2010</ref>

[[Esophageal_pH_monitoring|Esophageal pH monitoring]] : a probe can be placed via the nose into the esophagus to record the level of [[acidity|acidity]] in the lower esophagus.  Because some degree of variation in acidity is normal, and small reflux events are relatively common, esophageal pH monitoring can be used to document reflux in real-time.
-->
===機械===<!--
[[Manometry|Manometry]]: in this test, a pressure sensor ([[manometer|manometer]]) is passed via the mouth into the esophagus and measures the pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter directly.

[[Endoscopy|Endoscopy]]: the esophageal mucosa can be visualized directly by passing a thin, lighted tube with a tiny camera known as an endoscope attached through the mouth to examine the esophagus and stomach.  In this way, evidence of esophageal inflammation can be detected, and biopsies taken if necessary. Since an endoscopy allows a doctor to visually inspect the upper digestive tract the procedure may help identify any additional damage to the tract that may not have been detected otherwise.

[[Biopsy|Biopsy]]: a small sample of tissue from the esophagus is removed. It is then studied to check for inflammation, cancer, or other problems.

[[Antacid|Antacid]]s such as [[calcium_carbonate|calcium carbonate]] are often taken to treat the immediate problem,<ref>http://www.heartburn.com/ReliefAndManagement/Antacids.aspx</ref> with further treatments depending on the underlying cause.  Medicines such as [[H2_receptor_antagonist|H2 receptor antagonist]]s or [[proton_pump_inhibitors|proton pump inhibitors]] are effective for [[gastritis|gastritis]] and [[GERD|GERD]], the two most common causes of heartburn.  Antibiotics are used if [[H._pylori|H. pylori]] is present.
