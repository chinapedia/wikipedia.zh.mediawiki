'''受控词表'''（controlled vocabularies）又称为'''控制词汇表'''、'''受控词汇表'''或者'''控制词表'''， 是一种对[[知识|知识]]加以组织整理，以便后续进行[[检索|检索]]的手段。受控词表在[[主题词标引|主题词标引]]方案、[[主题词表|主题词表]]、[[叙词表|叙词表]]、[[分类法|分类法]]以及[[本体_(信息科学)|本体]]等[[语义谱|语义谱]]成员之中都有应用。受控词表方案强制要求采用预先确定且经过权威认定的[[术语|术语]]，而这些术语是由[[词表|词表]]的设计者原先选定的。相比之下，[[自然语言|自然语言]]词表并没有施加此类限制。

== 图书馆与資訊科学领域 ==
在[[图书馆学|图书馆]]与[[資訊科学|資訊科学]]领域，控制詞彙乃是一系列精心选择的[[词汇|词汇]]和[[短语|短语]]；这些词汇和短语用于对各种各样的信息单位（文档或作品）加以标记，以便更加简便地通过搜索而获取到这些信息单位{{ref|warner}}{{ref|fast}}。通过确保仅仅采用一条权威术语来描述每个概念以及受控词表之中的每条权威术语仅仅描述一个概念，受控词表解决的是有关同形异义词、同义词和多义词的问题。简而言之，受控词表有助于减少[[自然语言|正常人类语言]]内在所固有的[[歧义|歧义]]问题，从而保证一致性。在自然语言当中，同一概念可以有多种不同的名称。

For example, in the Library of Congress Subject Heading (a subject heading system that uses controlled vocabulary), authorised terms (subject headings in this case) have to be chosen to handle choices between variant spellings of the same concept (American versus British), choice among scientific and popular terms (Cockroaches versus Periplaneta americana), choices between synonyms (automobile versus cars) among other difficult issues. 

Choices of authorised terms are based on the principles of [[user_warrant|user warrant]] (what terms users are likely to use), [[literary_warrant|literary warrant]] (what terms are generally used in the literature and documents), [[structural_warrant|structural warrant]] (terms chosen by considering the structure, scope of the controlled vocabulary).

Controlled vocabularies also typically handle the problem of [[homographs|homographs]]，with qualifiers. For example, the term "pool" has to be qualified to refer to either swimming pool, or the game pool to ensure that each authorised term or heading refers to only one concept. 

There are two main kinds of controlled vocabulary tools used in libraries: subject headings and thesauri. While the differences between the two are diminishing, there are still some minor differences.

Historically subject headings were designed to describe books in library catalogs by catalogers while thesauri were used by indexers to apply index terms to documents and articles. Subject headings tend to be broader in scope describing whole books, while thesauri tend to be more specialised covering very specific disciplines. Also because of the card catalog system, subject headings tend to have terms that are in indirect order (though with the rise of automated systems this is being removed), while thesaurus terms are always in direct order. Subject headings also tend to use more [[pre-co-ordination|pre-co-ordination]] of terms such that the designer of the controlled vocabulary will combine various concepts together to form one authorised subject heading. (e.g.,  children and terrorism) while thesauri tend to use singular direct terms. Lastly thesauri list not only equivalent terms but also narrower, broader terms and related terms among various authorised and non-authorised terms, while historically most subject headings did not.

For example Library of Congress Subject Heading itself did not have much [[syndetic|syndetic]] structure until 1943, and it was not until 1985 when it began to adopt the thesauri type term "Broader term" and "Narrow term".

The [[terminology|terms]] are chosen and organized by trained professionals (including librarians and information scientists) who possess expertise in the subject area. Controlled vocabulary terms can accurately describe what a given document is actually about, even if the terms themselves do not occur within the document's text. Well known subject heading systems include the Library of Congress system, MESH, and Sears. Well known thesauri include the Art and Architecture Thesaurus and the ERIC Thesaurus.

Choosing authorized terms to be used is a tricky business, besides the areas already considered above, the designer has to consider the [[specific|specific]]ity of the term chosen, whether to use [[direct_entry|direct entry]]，inter consistency and stability of the language. Lastly the amount of pre-co-ordinate (in which case the degree of enumeration versus synthesis becomes an issue) and post co-ordinate in the system is another important issue 

Controlled vocabularies tagged to documents are [[metadata|metadata]]。

== 标引语言 ==
目前，标引语言主要有三种类型：
*受控标引语言：标引员只能采用经过批准的术语来描述文档。
*自然语言标引语言：来自所标引文档之中的任何术语均可用于描述该文档。
*自由标引语言：可以采用任何术语（并不仅仅是那些来自所标引文档的术语）来描述所标引的文档。

When indexing a document, the indexer also has to choose the level of indexing exhaustivity, the level of detail in which the document is described. For example using low indexing exhaustivity, minor aspects of the work will not be described with index terms. In general the higher the indexing exhaustivity, the more terms indexed for each document. 

In recent years '''free text search''' as a means of access to documents has become popular. This involves using natural language indexing with an indexing exhaustively set to maximum (every word in the text is ''indexed''). Many studies have been done to compare the efficiency and effectiveness of free text searches against documents that have been indexed by experts using a few well chosen controlled vocabulary descriptors.

Controlled vocabularies are often claimed to improve the accuracy of [[free_text_search|free text search]]ing, such as to reduce [[Relevance_(Information_Retrieval)|irrelevant]] items in the retrieval list. These irrelevant items（[[false_positives|false positives]]）are often caused by the inherent ambiguity of [[natural_language|natural language]]。Take the English word ''football'' for example. ''Football'' is the name given to a number of different [[team_sport|team sport]]s. Worldwide the most popular of these team sports is [[Football_(soccer)|Association football]]，which also happens to be called ''[[soccer|soccer]]'' in several countries. The [[English_language|English language]] [[football_(word)|word football]] is also applied to [[Rugby_football|Rugby football]]（[[Rugby_union|Rugby union]] and [[rugby_league|rugby league]]）, [[American_football|American football]]，[[Australian_rules_football|Australian rules football]]，[[Gaelic_football|Gaelic football]]，and [[Canadian_football|Canadian football]]。A search for ''football'' therefore will retrieve documents that are about several completely different sports. Controlled vocabulary solves this problem by [[Tag_(metadata)|tagging]] the documents in such a way that the ambiguities are eliminated. 

Compared to free text searching, the use of a controlled vocabulary can dramatically increase the performance of an information retrieval system, if performance is measured by precision (the percentage of documents in the retrieval list that are actually [[relevance|relevant]] to the search topic). 

In some cases controlled vocabulary can enhance recall as well, because unlike natural language schemes, once the correct authorised term is searched, you don't need to worry about searching for other terms that might be synonyms of that term.   

However, a controlled vocabulary search may also lead to unsatisfactory [[Recall_(information_retrieval)|recall]]，in that it will fail to retrieve some documents that are actually relevant to the search question. 

This is particularly problematic when the search question involves terms that are sufficiently tangential to the subject area such that the indexer might have decided to tag it using a different term (but the searcher might consider the same). Essentially, this can be avoided only by an experienced user of controlled vocabulary whose understanding of the vocabulary coincides with the way it is used by the indexer.

Another possibility is that the article is just not tagged by the indexer because indexing exhaustivity is low. For example an article might mention football as a secondary focus, and the indexer might decide not to tag it with "football" because it is not important enough compared to the main focus. But it turns out that for the searcher that article is relevant and hence recall fails. A free text search would automatically pick up that article regardless. 

On the other hand free text searches have high exhaustivity (you search on every word) so it has potential for high recall (assuming you solve the problems of synonyms by entering every combination) but will have much lower precision.

Controlled vocabularies are also quickly out-dated and in fast developing fields of knowledge, the authorised terms available might not be available if they are not updated regularly. Even in the best case scenario, controlled language is often not as specific as using the words of the text itself. Indexers trying to choose the appropriate index terms might mis-interpret the author, while a free text search is in no danger of doing so, because it uses the author's own words. 

The use of controlled vocabularies can be costly compared to free text searches because human experts  or expensive automated systems are necessary to index each entry.  Furthermore, the user has to be familiar with the controlled vocabulary scheme to make best use of the system. But as already mentioned, the control of synonyms, homographs can help increase precision.

Numerous methodologies have been developed to assist in the creation of controlled vocabularies, including [[faceted_classification|faceted classification]]，which enables a given data record or document to be described in multiple ways.

Controlled vocabularies, such as the [[Library_of_Congress_Subject_Headings|Library of Congress Subject Headings]]，are an essential component of [[bibliography|bibliography]]，the study and classification of books. They were initially developed in [[library_and_information_science|library and information science]]。In the 1950s, government agencies  began to develop controlled vocabularies for the burgeoning journal literature in specialized fields; an example is the [[Medical_Subject_Headings|Medical Subject Headings]] (MeSH) developed by the [[United_States_National_Library_of_Medicine|U.S. National Library of Medicine]]。Subsequently, for-profit firms（called [[Abstracting_and_indexing_services|Abstracting and indexing services]]）emerged to index the fast-growing literature in every field of knowledge. In the 1960s, an [[online_bibliographic_database|online bibliographic database]] industry developed based on dialup [[X.25|X.25]] networking. These services were seldom made available to the public because they were difficult to use; specialist librarians called [[search_intermediaries|search intermediaries]] handled the searching job. In the 1980s, the first [[full_text|full text]] databases appeared; these databases contain the full text of the index articles as well as the bibliographic information. Online bibliographic databases have migrated to the Internet and are now publicly available; however, most are proprietary and can be expensive to use. Students enrolled in colleges and universities may be able to access some of these services without charge; some of these services may be accessible without charge at a public library.

In large organizations, controlled vocabularies may be introduced to improve [[technical_communication|technical communication]]。The use of controlled vocabulary ensures that everyone is using the same word to mean the same thing.  This consistency of terms is one of the most important concepts in [[technical_writing|technical writing]] and [[knowledge_management|knowledge management]]，where effort is expended to use the same word throughout a [[document|document]] or [[organization|organization]] instead of slightly different ones to refer to the same thing.

Web searching could be dramatically improved by the development of a controlled vocabulary for describing Web pages; the use of such a vocabulary could culminate in a [[Semantic_Web|Semantic Web]]，in which the content of Web pages is described using a machine-readable [[metadata|metadata]] scheme. One of the first proposals for such a scheme is the [[Dublin_Core|Dublin Core]] Initiative.

It is unlikely that a single metadata scheme will ever succeed in describing the content of the entire Web.{{ref|doctorow}} To create a Semantic Web, it may be necessary to draw from two or more metadata systems to describe a Web page's contents. The [[eXchangeable_Faceted_Metadata_Language|eXchangeable Faceted Metadata Language]] (XFML) is designed to enable controlled vocabulary creators to publish and share metadata systems. XFML is designed on [[faceted_classification|faceted classification]] principles.{{ref|pilgrim}}
