B. Saunders|date=1900|language=en|first=George Milbry|last=Gould|first2=Walter Lytle|last2=Pyle|quote=Priapism is sometimes seen as a curious symptom of lesion of the spinal cord. In such cases it is totally unconnected with any voluptuous sensation, and is only found accompanied by motor paralysis. It may occur spontaneously immediately after accident involving the cord, and is then probably due to undue excitement of the portion of the cord below the lesion, which is deprived of the regulating influence of the brain... Pressure on the cerebellum is supposed to account for cases of priapism observed in executions and suicides by hanging. There is an instance recorded of an Italian ''castrata'' who said he provoked sexual pleasure by partially hanging himself.}}</ref>已知與脊髓損傷也有關係。<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Neck Trauma: Practice Essentials, Pathophysiology, Frequency|url=https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/827223-overview|date=2019-11-09|journal=|access-date=2020-12-24|archive-date=2008-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208032137/http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic331.htm|dead-url=no}}</ref>死亡勃起發生后，陰莖會排出尿液或前列腺中的液體。此外，槍擊頭部、主動脈損傷及被毒殺者的身上也會出現這種現象，因此檢察屍體有無死亡勃起被法醫學當做一種判斷死者生前是否受虐的方法。<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Forensic Medicine|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC36308102&id=n0YJAAAAIAAJ&pg=RA3-PA246&hl=zh-CN|publisher=H.
