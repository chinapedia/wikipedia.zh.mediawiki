<!--==劇情==
During a knife storm, Finn and Jake stay in their treehouse and construct a massive pillow fort. Finn, however, is feeling sad, and eventually reveals to Jake that he thinks his relationship with Flame Princess is over because she did not laugh at a joke he made. Jake tries to convince Finn that he is imagining a scenario that does not exist, but Finn does not listen. Instead, he ventures into the pillow fort to let his mind "fester". Finn soon discovers that he has been transported into some sort of magical pillow land. After slaying a pillow dragon, he becomes friends with a pillow person named Quilton, who is revealed to be the leader of the land. He soon meets Quilton's daughter Roselinen.

A long times passes, and Finn grows up and marries Roselinen. They have two children, Bonnie and Jay. Despite being an adult, Finn still wants to find his way back to Jake. He travels to an oracle named Rasheeta, who tells him he will not remain in the land for long. Eventually, Finn grows into an old man and dies. As his spirit flies though some sort of darkened realm, he eventually wakes up in the pillow fort, a child once again. Right before he is able to tell Jake about his other life, Finn receives a call from Flame Princess, who tells him that she finally got his joke. After he hangs up, he cannot seem to recall the life he just lived.
