==沿革==
South Bank was originally a meeting place for the traditional landowners, the [[Turrbal|Turrbal]] and [[Yuggera|Yuggera]] people and, in the early 1840s it became the central focus point of early European settlement. From the 1850s, South Bank Precinct was quickly established as the business centre of Brisbane. However, this was all disrupted in the 1893, when floods forced the central business district to shift to the northern side of the river and attain higher ground. This is where the Brisbane central business district still stands today. This began the decline of South Bank, and the area became home to vaudeville theatres, derelict boarding houses, and light and heavy industry.

The 1970s marked the beginnings of a new era, with parkland reclaimed along the river bank, and the [[Queensland_Cultural_Centre|Queensland Cultural Centre]] was built which included the [[Queensland_Art_Gallery|Queensland Art Gallery]], the [[Queensland_Museum|Queensland Museum]], the [[Queensland_Performing_Arts_Centre|Queensland Performing Arts Centre]] and [[State_Library_of_Queensland|State Library of Queensland]] (today it also includes the [[Queensland_Gallery_of_Modern_Art|Queensland Gallery of Modern Art]].

In 1988, Brisbane held a successful [[World_Expo_88|World Expo 88]], following which the Government intended to develop the site for commercial interests. However, a public campaign successfully lobbied for the site to be redeveloped as parkland for the enjoyment of people in Brisbane. In 1989, the South Bank Corporation, a Queensland Government statutory body, was established to oversee the development and management of the new South Bank Parklands.<ref>http://www.southbankcorporation.com.au/our-heritage-and-milestones</ref>-->

[[Image:Streetsa_Beacha.jpg|thumb]]
A major feature within the parkland is its man-made beach, which is 2000 square metres of free-formed concrete surrounded by 4000 cubic metres of sand. The sand surrounding the beach is sourced from the Rous Channel in [[Moreton_Bay|Moreton Bay]] and every year the beach is topped up with an additional 70 tonnes to ensure that it is kept in pristine condition. Almost half of the lagoon area sits on reclaimed land that was once the [[Brisbane_River|Brisbane River]]. The Streets Beach Facts was designed by Desmond Brookes International. It was constructed by Fletcher Jennings Construction and Water and Industrial Engineering. Construction commenced in February 1991 and was complete by June 1992.

The beach has received awards including the 1999 Moreton Bay region's cleanest beach in the Keep Australia Beautiful Council's Clean Beach Challenge and the 2001 Environmental Protection Agency’s Keep Australia Beautiful Clean Beach Challenge, Friendliest Beach Award. The beach area comprises a lagoon with enough water to fill five Olympic swimming pools, with sand beaches, palm trees, rocky creeks and subtropical trees and exotic plantings.
The beach is patrolled seven days a week by lifeguards.

The lagoon contains chlorinated fresh water that is recirculated every six hours at up to 125 litres per second. Water for the beach is pumped through two large sand filters and chemically treated before being pumped back into the pools. Dredge pump and self-propelled sifting machines clean the adjoining pools. <ref>http://www.visitsouthbank.com.au/streets-beach</ref>-->

<!--
== 概念 ==
When South Bank Parklands were developed following [[World_Expo_88|World Expo 88]], there were canals, bridges and launches. There were also a wildlife refuge called [[Gondwana_Rainforest_Sanctuary|Gondwana Rainforest Sanctuary]] as well as a Butterfly House. In January 1998, Gondwana Rainforest Sanctuary was closed down and the animals relocated.

The Butterfly House was later renamed as the Butterfly and Insect House. In April 1998, the Butterfly and Insect House was renamed as South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary, with the introduction of other wildlife. In the latter half of 2005, the South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary was closed and dismantled and an office and retail store were built on the South Bank Wildlife Sanctuary's former location. Also gone from South Bank Parklands are the canals, bridges and launches.-->
