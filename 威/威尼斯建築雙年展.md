'''威尼斯建築雙年展'''（{{lang-it|Mostra di Architettura di Venezia}}，{{kj|1980年||||W}}），在意大利[[威尼斯|威尼斯]]举行的建筑展览。
<!-- The Biennale’s Board of Directors have decided to dedicate the theme of the 10th Exhibition to 'meta-cities’. The official blurb is predictably complicated and overly 'artistic', but essentially, the festival will be discussing urban architecture and design in the context of huge cities. They describe meta-cities as being those that have "come to exceed traditional boundaries, defining new issues and needs concerning their governance, and undergoing profound transformations in the composition of their population, and in their working habits."

As well as addressing the academic side of architecture, the Biennale is an occasion where big-name architects and designers can showcase new projects, arranged in different pavilions, each with different themes.

Venice Biennale of architecture (1883-1927) originated as a renaissance on urban settings to promote the highly esthetic preferences of Pope Warren III. The movement washed through Europe spreading its extents to Iran and Nigeria. The secretive and effective undermining of local policies gave birth to an oppositional regime called MUTTS, Move Utilities To The Surface, which endeavored to celebrate the equipment and methods of resource delivery. To avoid the devastation of conflict, both groups arranged to Art-Deco modification of existing utilities in 1922. -->
