==歷史==
本鎮位於早期美國原住民來往今日紐約與卡羅萊納之間的通道上。在18世紀中期，數以萬計的歐洲移民乘坐馬車沿著同樣的路，由賓夕法尼亞州向西方與南方移居。1744年在今日的威廉斯波特建立了渡過波多馬克河的渡船服務，今天車輛則由渡口下游一英里處經由81號州際公路跨過波多馬克河。

今天威廉斯波特鎮的土地以前是由美國獨立戰爭中一位大陸軍的軍官[[:en:Otho_Holland_Williams|Otho Holland Williams]]所有，本鎮也因此得名。

===Economic growth===
In 1834, boats using a portion of the newly built [[Chesapeake_and_Ohio_Canal|Chesapeake and Ohio Canal]] were able to reach Williamsport from [[Washington,_D.C.|Washington, D.C.]] The canal itself was extended to Williamsport in 1835.<ref name="C&O Handbook">{{cite book |title=Chesapeake and Ohio Canal |first= |last= |authorlink= |publisher=National Park Service |location=Washington, D.C. |year=1991 |isbn=0-912627-43-3 |url=}} Handbook No. 142.</ref>{{rp|96}} The canal became an important commercial route which connected the area with the lower Potomac River region and the [[Chesapeake_Bay|Chesapeake Bay]], and later with the [[Cumberland,_Maryland|Cumberland, Maryland]] region as the canal construction continued westward. Williamsport became a very popular waterfront town which benefited the economy. In 1873, the [[Western_Maryland_Railway|Western Maryland Railway]] extended its line from Hagerstown to Williamsport, in order to gain access to canal traffic. Coal from Cumberland area mines was one of the principal commodities transferred from canal barges to rail cars at Williamsport.<ref name="Cook">{{cite book|last=Cook |first=Roger |author2=Zimmermann, Karl  |title=The Western Maryland Railway: Fireballs and Black Diamonds |publisher=Garrigues House |location=Laurys Station, Pennsylvania |year=1992 |edition=2nd |isbn=0-9620844-4-1 |pages=33–34}}</ref>

===Flooding===
In 1863, during the [[American_Civil_War|Civil War]], the overflowing flooding waters of the river prevented General [[Robert_E._Lee|Robert E.
