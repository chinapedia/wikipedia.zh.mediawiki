==生平==
Born in [[Canterbury|Canterbury]], [[England|England]] to Agnes Sealy Vidal and Colonel Frederic Gosset, Gosset attended [[Winchester_College|Winchester College]], the famous private school, before reading [[chemistry|chemistry]] and [[mathematics|mathematics]] at [[New_College,_Oxford|New College, Oxford]].  On graduating in [[1899|1899]], he joined the [[Dublin|Dublin]] brewery of Arthur [[Guinness|Guinness]] & Son.

[[Guinness|Guinness]] was a progressive agro-chemical business and Gosset would apply his statistical knowledge both in the brewery and on the farm—to the selection of the best yielding varieties of [[barley|barley]]. Gosset acquired that knowledge by study, trial and error and by spending two terms in 1906/7 in the biometric laboratory of [[Karl_Pearson|Karl Pearson]]. Gosset and [[Karl_Pearson|Pearson]] had a good relationship and Pearson helped Gosset with the mathematics of his papers. [[Karl_Pearson|Pearson]] helped with the 1908 papers but he had little appreciation of their importance. The papers addressed the brewer's concern with small samples, while the biometrician typically had hundreds of observations and saw no urgency in developing small-sample methods.

Another researcher at Guinness had previously published a paper containing trade secrets of the Guinness brewery. To prevent further disclosure of confidential information, Guinness prohibited its employees from publishing any papers regardless of the contained information. This meant that Gosset was unable to publish his works under his own name. He therefore used the pseudonym ''Student'' for his publications to avoid their detection by his employer. Thus his most famous achievement is now referred to as the [[Student's_t-distribution|Student t-distribution]], which might otherwise have been the Gosset t-distribution. 

Using this pseudonym [[Karl_Pearson|Pearson]] published ''The probable error of a mean'' and almost all of Gosset's papers in his journal ''[[Biometrika|Biometrika]]''. However, it was [[Ronald_Fisher|R.A. Fisher]] who appreciated the importance of Gosset's small-sample work, after Gosset had written to him to say ''I am sending you a copy of Student's Tables as you are the only man that's ever likely to use them!''. Fisher believed that Gosset had effected a “logical revolution”. Ironically the ''t''-statistic for which Gosset is famous was actually Fisher's creation. Gosset's statistic was ''z'' = ''t''/√(''n'' - 1). Fisher introduced the ''t''-form because it fitted in with his theory of [[Degrees_of_freedom_(statistics)|degrees of freedom]]. Fisher was also responsible for the applications of the ''t''-distribution to regression.

Although introduced by others, [[Studentized_residual|Studentized residual]]s are named in Student's honor because, like the problem that led to Student's t-distribution, the idea of adjusting for estimated standard deviations is central to that concept.

Gosset's interest in [[barley|barley]] cultivation led him to speculate that [[design_of_experiments|design of experiments]] should aim, not only at improving the average yield, but also at breeding varieties whose yield was insensitive (robust) to variation in soil and climate. This principle only occurs in the later thought of [[Ronald_Fisher|Fisher]] and then in the work of [[Genichi_Taguchi|Genichi Taguchi]] in the [[1950s|1950s]].

In [[1935|1935]], he left [[Dublin|Dublin]] to take up the position of Head Brewer, in charge of the scientific side of production, at a new [[Guinness|Guinness]] brewery in London.  He died in [[Beaconsfield|Beaconsfield]], [[England|England]] of a heart attack<ref>{{cite web

Gosset was a friend of both [[Karl_Pearson|Pearson]] and [[Ronald_Fisher|Fisher]], an achievement, for each had a massive ego and a loathing for the other. Gosset was a modest man who cut short an admirer with the comment that “Fisher would have discovered it all anyway.”
