'''威尔弗里德·劳雷尔大学'''（Wilfrid Laurier University，又譯作[[偉佛羅利亞大學|偉佛羅利亞大學]]、[[勞里埃大學|勞里埃大學]]）是位于[[加拿大|加拿大]][[安大略|安大略]]省滑鐵盧市大學西街75號的一所公立大学，得名于[[加拿大历史|加拿大历史]]上第一位法裔[[加拿大总理|总理]][[威尔弗里德·劳雷尔|威尔弗里德·劳雷尔]]。 

该校在1911年時。名叫Evangelical Lutheran Seminary of Canada。1914年，改名Waterloo College School。1923年，再改名為Waterloo College of Arts。 1959年，又改名為University of Waterloo，後又改名Waterloo Lutheran University。1973年才改為現在的 Wilfrid Laurier University。

該大學是加拿大发展最快的大学之一，注册学生从1997年到2006年几乎翻倍。该校有三个校区，主校区位于安大略省[[滑鐵盧_(安大略省)|滑铁卢]]。<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=65 |title=Wilfrid Laurier University - Student Recruitment Office |access-date=2014-01-03 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304200755/http://www.wlu.ca/homepage.php?grp_id=65 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>在2014年[[麦克林|麦克林]]杂志的大学排名中，该校位居[[综合性大学|综合性大学]]（Comprehensive）的第十名。<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2013/10/31/2014-university-rankings-comprehensive-category-results/ |title=存档副本 |access-date=2014-01-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140101041516/http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2013/10/31/2014-university-rankings-comprehensive-category-results/ |archive-date=2014-01-01 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> <!--In 2013, Research Infosource Inc. ranked Laurier University in the top 50 of research universities in Canada, out of nearly 100 Canadian universities in existence.<ref>http://www.researchinfosource.com/pdf/2013Top50List.pdf</ref> Laurier is one of only 8 universities in Canada to have its own publishing company; it has a 39-year history.-->

==历史==
威尔弗里德·劳雷尔大學的历史溯源于1911的'''Waterloo Lutheran Seminary of Canada'''（加拿大滑铁卢[[路德宗|路德宗]]学院）， <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wlu.ca/~wwwsem/index.shtml |title=存档副本 |accessdate=2004-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040403170956/http://www.wlu.ca/~wwwsem/index.shtml |archivedate=2004-04-03 }}</ref> 
1914年，该学院发展了很多非[[神学|神学]]领域的课程被更名为 the Waterloo College School， 1924年更名为'''Waterloo College of Arts'''，并提供三年制的学士学位课程。 <ref name=autogenerated1>http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm {{Wayback|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm |date=20080726164759 }}? PgNm=TCE&Params=U1ARTU0003698</ref> 1925年，'''Waterloo College of Arts''' 成为[[西安大略大学|西安大略大学]]的附属学院。 

Laurier's school colours of purple and gold originated in 1927: maroon and gold were the colours of Waterloo College, but to honour the link with the University of Western Ontario, whose colours were purple and white, maroon was discarded in favour of purple.
[[File:LaurierU.jpg|thumb]] 

The Waterloo College Chapel features several stained glass windows including `Light of the world` (1941) and `Christ in the garden` (1940) by Robert McCausland Limited. 

[[滑铁卢大学|滑铁卢大学]]的歷史可追溯到1957年7月1日成立的[[滑鐵盧專科聯合學院|滑鐵盧專科聯合學院]](Waterloo College Associate Faculties)，是當時的[[滑鐵盧學院|滑鐵盧學院]]（即現在的[[威尔弗里德·劳雷尔大學|威尔弗里德·劳雷尔大學]]）的一個半自治部門機構。該機構於1959年正式脫離滑鐵盧學院並升格為大學。

1960年加拿大[[路德宗|路德宗]]教会结束了对[[滑鐵盧學院|滑鐵盧學院]]（Waterloo College）的资助，同时更名为'''Waterloo Lutheran University'''，同时该学院也不再是[[西安大略大学|西安大略大学]]的附属学院。 <ref name=autogenerated1 />

Wilfrid Laurier University was established by Wilfrid Laurier University Act 1973, which was amended in 2001.<ref>www.wlu.ca/page.php?grp_id=158&p=2235 Wilfrid Laurier University Act.</ref> 

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dscn0017.jpg|thumb]].]]  -->Laurier opened a second campus, in Brantford, Ontario, in 1999, and in 2006 the Lyle S. Hallman Faculty of Social Work moved from the Waterloo campus to a campus in downtown Kitchener. The Brantford campus is centred on a number of historic properties in the downtown area which have been restored for university use.  They include a former [[Carnegie_library|Carnegie library]], Brantford's 1880 post office, and 1870 mansion, and a 1950 Odeon Theatre. The Kitchener campus is located in the historic and fully renovated former St. Jerome's high school building.

In October 2008, the University was named one of [[Waterloo_Area's_Top_Employers|Waterloo Area's Top Employers]] and featured in the [[Waterloo_Region_Record|Waterloo Region Record]] and [[Guelph_Mercury|Guelph Mercury]] newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-wilfrid-laurier-university|title=Reasons for Selection, 2009 Waterloo Area's Top Employers Competition|access-date=2014-01-03|archive-date=2009-07-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090712032939/http://www.eluta.ca/top-employer-wilfrid-laurier-university|dead-url=no}}</ref>

[[Waterloo_Lutheran_Seminary|Waterloo Lutheran Seminary]] continues to operate in affiliation with the University and the [[Evangelical_Lutheran_Church_in_Canada|Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada]].

=== 校名 ===
滑鐵盧路德宗大學（Waterloo Lutheran University）在轉型為公立大學之時需要去除原校名中的宗教涵義。包括Beaver University、Riel University、the Iroquois University of Waterloo在內，一共有多達94個候選名稱。新校名最終於1973年被確定為威爾弗里德·勞雷爾大學（Wilfrid Laurier University）。有爭議的是彼時一些學生抗議稱Wilfrid Laurier實為一值得商榷的政治人物，且無論與學校還是滑鐵盧地區皆無任何聯繫。有猜測稱之所以命名為Wilfrid Laurier University是為了保留學校原有的首字母WLU，以減少更改檔案的麻煩。<ref>Cote, Kris: "The Cord History: The tie that's bound WLU for 80 years", page 13. Wilfrid Laurier University Student Publication, 2006.</ref>
<!--When [[Waterloo_Lutheran_University|Waterloo Lutheran University]] became a public university, a new name was needed. There were 94 proposed names, among them Beaver University, Louis Riel University and the Iroquois University of Waterloo. Eventually Wilfrid Laurier University was selected in 1973, but not without controversy, as some students at the time charged that [[Wilfrid_Laurier|Wilfrid Laurier]] was a politician of "questionable reputation" who had no connection to the school or the region of Waterloo. There has been speculation  over the years that the name Wilfrid Laurier University was chosen mainly to preserve the initials as WLU.<ref>Cote, Kris: "The Cord History: The tie that's bound WLU for 80 years", page 13. Wilfrid Laurier University Student Publication, 2006.</ref>-->

===Book publishing===
The [[Wilfrid_Laurier_University_Press|Wilfrid Laurier University Press]], which was founded in 1974, deals with archaeology, military history and sociology/anthropology.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/ |title=The Canadian Encyclopedia<!-- Bot generated title --> |accessdate=2014-01-03 |archive-date=2008-08-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827201219/http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/ |dead-url=no }}</ref> Wilfrid Laurier University Press is one of only 8 university publishers found in Canada.

== 学术 ==
The University is home to 14,116 full-time and part-time undergraduate students, 781 full-time and part-time graduate students and over 500 in faculty and staff,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wlu.ca/page.php?grp_id=12015&p=14901 |title=存档副本 |access-date=2014-01-03 |archive-date=2015-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514163703/http://www.wlu.ca/page.php?grp_id=12015&p=14901 |dead-url=yes }}</ref> although comparatively small, the university has consistently ranked among Canada's top schools in its category, an honour which is regularly confirmed by [[Maclean's|Maclean's]] magazine's annual rankings. The 2008 Macleans rankings placed Laurier fifth overall (first in Ontario) of the 21 Canadian universities in the category of "Primarily Undergraduate" universities.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.macleans.ca/education/rankings.jsp |title=存档副本 |access-date=2014-01-03 |archive-date=2008-02-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080221204043/http://www.macleans.ca/education/rankings.jsp |dead-url=yes }}</ref>

In 2008, for undergrad programs, the minimum entering average was 80.3% for the arts, 80.8% for science, and 86.3% for business.<ref>Liu, Karon: "High grades for school spirit", 24 Hours Toronto, page 16. Monday September 15, 2008.</ref>

The internationally renowned Faculty of Music at Laurier is considered one of the best in the country, with programs in performance, music education, composition, music history, church music, theory and music therapy. In addition, Laurier is home to the Penderecki String Quartet - an internationally recognised group playing largely new compositions. The music faculty boasts two performance spaces - the Theatre Auditorium and the Maureen Forrester Recital Hall (named after the famous contralto and former chancellor of WLU). The faculty also attracts a greater percentage of students from outside Ontario than any other faculty at Laurier.  Laurier's Music program boasts the only Masters Degree in Music Therapy. Laurier's strength in "music and business education" is touted as one of the reasons that Waterloo Region is a "powerful educational hub" by former University of Waterloo president, and now Governor-General of Canada, [[David_Johnston|David Johnston]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The university is also home to the Laurier Institute for the Study of Public Opinion and Policy, the Laurier Centre for Military, Strategic and Disarmament Studies, the Cold Regions Research Centre, and several other research centres. 

Laurier is the current headquarters of the [[Academic_Council_of_the_United_Nations_System|Academic Council of the United Nations System]] (ACUNS) which was previously hosted by Yale, Brown and Dartmouth. The ACUNS goal is to strengthen the study of international organizations and to create strong ties between the academic community and diplomats within international organizations.

Laurier is also a prominent partner in the new Balsillie School of International Affairs, opened in Uptown Waterloo in 2008. The school offers three programs: a masters in arts in global governance, a masters in international public policy and a PHD program in global governance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.balsillieschool.ca/ |title=存档副本 |access-date=2014-01-03 |archive-date=2021-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210215082427/https://www.balsillieschool.ca/ |dead-url=no }}</ref>

In the Fall of 2006 the Faculty of Social Work (previously on the Waterloo campus) moved to downtown Kitchener.  Located on Duke St. it moved into the old St. Jerome's High School which was designated a heritage site by the City of Kitchener.  This move allowed the students to be closer to the community and social service agencies with which they are partnered.  Also in an effort to partner better with the community and make the building more welcoming, faculty and staff held such events as the Political Coffee House Series, several all-candidates debates and the [[Expressions_of_Social_Justice_Festival|Expressions of Social Justice Festival]]

==体育==
The university is represented in [[Canadian_Interuniversity_Sport|Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] by the [[Wilfrid_Laurier_Golden_Hawks|Wilfrid Laurier Golden Hawks]]. 

The history of the team name (Golden Hawks) dates back to the 1961. For many years, the Waterloo College teams were called simply the Waterloo College teams, although sometimes they were called the Purple and Gold and other times the Waterloons. 
In 1950, the college's newspaper mused that a name was needed, and in December 1951 a new name was tested: the Mules.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cordweekly.com/cordweekly/myweb.php?hls=10034&news_id=1335 |title=Laurier Trivia Challenge |publisher=The Cord Weekly |accessdate=2008-03-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220003934/http://www.cordweekly.com/cordweekly/myweb.php?hls=10034&news_id=1335 |archivedate=2008-02-20 |deadurl=yes }}</ref>

Subsequently, the hockey team became the Ice Mules and the women's basketball and volleyball teams were known as the Mulettes.

In 1960, with the shift from college to university status, the university student newspaper again lobbied for change.
At a meeting that year, somebody suggested Golden Hawks and that was the name adopted. A headline in the January 16, 1961 issue of the newspaper read "From 'Jackass' to 'Bird of Prey'".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laurierathletics.com/createarticle.php?ID=1130&string=White|title=The Golden Hawk - How Laurier's official mascot came to be|accessdate=2008-03-07|archive-date=2016-03-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313004753/http://www.laurierathletics.com/createarticle.php?id=1130&string=white|dead-url=no}}</ref>

On November 13, 2004, the Golden Hawks football team won the [[Yates_Cup|Yates Cup]] against the [[McMaster_Marauders|McMaster Marauders]] at University Stadium in front of a record crowd of 8,175. It was the sixth Yates Cup victory for Laurier in its history. The game also ended McMaster's four-year Ontario championship winning streak.  The men's football team scored a second successive Yates Cup victory in November, 2005, followed by a victory in the [[Uteck_Bowl|Uteck Bowl]] against [[Acadia_University|Acadia]]. The Hawks then defeated the [[University_of_Saskatchewan_Huskies|University of Saskatchewan Huskies]] 24-23 to win the 2005 [[Vanier_Cup|Vanier Cup]], their first since 1991.

Laurier's first female national championship was won in 1992 by the women's soccer team, which followed that up with their second CIS title in 1995. The men's soccer team claimed back-to-back national championships in 2000 & 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laurierathletics.com/alumni/championships.php|title=Championships captured|accessdate=2010-03-03|archive-date=2020-09-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918174221/https://www.laurierathletics.com/alumni/championships.php|dead-url=no}}</ref> 

In 2007 the women's lacrosse team achieved a dynasty status by winning their fifth OUA [[Ontario_University_Athletics|Ontario University Athletics]] gold medal in a row. In February 2008, the women's hockey team claimed its fifth gold medal in as many years and seventh since 1998. The women's hockey team won its first CIS national championship in 2005. Both teams have since won sixth consecutive championships in their respective sports, furthering their dynasties.

In 2008 both the men's and women's curling teams won the inaugural CIS Championships and represented Canada in China at the 2009 World University Games. The women's team repeated as CIS Champion's in 2009 in Montreal and went on to represent Canada in the Karuizawa International Curling championships where they claimed first place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laurierathletics.com/createarticle.php?ID=4549|title=Women's Curling claims gold in Japan|accessdate=2010-01-31|archive-date=2017-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170926011547/https://www.laurierathletics.com/createarticle.php?ID=4549|dead-url=no}}</ref>
