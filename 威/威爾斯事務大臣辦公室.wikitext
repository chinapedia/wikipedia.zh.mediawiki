'''威爾斯事務大臣辦公室'''（{{lang-en|Office of the Secretary of State for Wales}}，{{lang-cy|Swyddfa Ysgrifennydd Gwladol Cymru}}），是一個[[英国政府部门|英国政府部门]]，取代{{le|1998年威爾斯政府法令|Government of Wales Act 1998|1999年權力下放}}前管治[[威爾斯|威爾斯]]的{{le|威爾斯事務部|Welsh Office}}。<ref name="history" />

== 歷史 ==
此部門以往曾被稱為「威爾斯於西敏的聲音和西敏於威爾斯的聲音」，但自從{{le|2006年威爾斯政府法令|Government of Wales Act 2006}}通過後越趨無力，只可以執行少數沒有轉移予[[威爾斯議會|威爾斯國民議會]]、仍然保留在威爾斯事務大臣職位上的權力以及為爭取一年一度的[[英国中央政府预算|對威爾斯的財政預算]]撥款。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/about/|title=About the Wales Office|language=en|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301153202/http://www.walesoffice.gov.uk/about/|archivedate=2012-03-01|website=Walesoffice.gov.uk|access-date=2012-03-08|dead-url=yes}}</ref>

威爾斯事務大臣雖然為此部門整體負責，但行政上（如刑事司法、法庭、監獄和假釋事務）部門則從屬於[[英國司法部|司法部]]。

Unlike [[Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Northern_Ireland|Northern Ireland]], Wales does not have its own [[Law_Officers_of_the_Crown|Law Officers of the Crown]]; it is part of the [[England_and_Wales|England and Wales]] legal jurisdiction. The [[Attorney_General_for_England_and_Wales|Attorney General for England and Wales]] therefore advises the United Kingdom Government on its law.<ref>[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/content/attorney-generals-office Cabinet Office List of Government Departments and Ministers: Attorney General's Office]</ref> His deputy is the [[Solicitor_General_for_England_and_Wales|Solicitor General for England and Wales]].

==Future==

Following the 'yes' vote in the [[2011_Welsh_devolution_referendum|2011 referendum]] on giving the Assembly direct law-making powers, some politicians in Wales, particularly from [[Plaid_Cymru|Plaid Cymru]], have called for the abolition of the Wales Office.<ref name= "bbc1">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12663213 Presiding officer suggests dropping Welsh secretary] – BBC News. Published 7 March 2011. Retrieved 8 March 2012</ref> [[Dafydd_Elis-Thomas|Lord Elis-Thomas]], Presiding Officer of the National Assembly for Wales said:

{{Quotation|I think it would be very useful to [wind up the Wales Office] before we start the next Assembly; that would be the logical time because that is the time when our new powers will become fully operational. The relationship then would be inter-governmental and inter-parliamentary. In other words it would be between the National Assembly and the Parliament at Westminster, where there are issues on laws which are made in Westminster which impinge on Wales and vice versa.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-12668293 Wales Office 'hard to justify' says Plaid Cymru leader] – BBC News. Published 07 March 2011. Retrieved 08 March 2012</ref>}}

However, Lord Elis-Thomas was accused of following a "[[separatism|separatist]] agenda" by the Conservative Cheryl Gillan, then Secretary of State for Wales. She was supported by her Labour predecessor [[Peter_Hain|Peter Hain]], who declared that Wales "still needs a voice around the [[Cabinet_of_the_United_Kingdom|Cabinet]] in Westminster".<ref name= "bbc1" />
