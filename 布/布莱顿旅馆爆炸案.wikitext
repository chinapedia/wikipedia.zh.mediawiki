'''布莱顿旅馆爆炸案'''（{{lang-en|Brighton hotel bombing}}）是1984年10月12日凌晨2:54（[[英國夏令時|BST]]），发生于[[英国|英国]]海滨旅游胜地[[布莱顿|布莱顿]]的[[白禮頓格蘭德酒店|布莱顿格兰德酒店]]的一次[[臨時派爱尔兰共和军|臨時派爱尔兰共和军]]组织的爆炸案。当时执政的[[保守党|保守党]]高级官员们正在那里召开年会。虽然警备森严，仍有2枚巨大的炸弹在此爆炸。有5个人在爆炸中死亡（包括{{link-en|安東尼·貝里|Anthony Berry}}爵士和{{link-en|John Wakeham}}的前妻Roberta），但没有一名英国内阁成员死亡。[[首相|首相]][[撒切尔夫人|撒切尔夫人]]还在准备演说，得以幸免，但政府其他成员重伤——贸易及工业大臣[[譚百德|譚百德]]（Norman Tebbit）的妻子也受伤瘫痪。

It shredded through her 浴室barely two minutes after she had left it; but she and her 丈夫[[Denis_Thatcher|Denis Thatcher]]escaped injury. Thatcher changed her clothes then was escorted by the security guards to Brighton 警察局, where she stayed for the rest of the night. As she left the hotel she gave an impromptu interview to the BBC's [[John_Cole|John Cole]]. [[Alistair_McAlpine,_Baron_McAlpine|Alistair McAlpine]] persuaded [[Marks_and_Spencers|Marks and Spencers]] to open early so those who had lost their clothes in the bombing could get new ones.-->

臨時派愛爾蘭共和軍次日宣布对此事件负责，说他们要再幹一次，其声明中的一句话也随之出名：
:“今天我们不走运，但记住我们只需要走一次运，而你们需要一直走运。”（Today we were unlucky, but remember we only have to be lucky once. You will have to be lucky always. ）
<!--
Thatcher began the next session of the conference at 9.30 am the following morning as scheduled, despite the number of dead and wounded still being unknown at that time. She omitted most of the planned attacks on the [[Labour_Party_(UK)|Labour Party]] from her speech and claimed the bombing was 'an attempt to cripple Her Majesty's democratically elected Government':

:''That is the scale of the outrage in which we have all shared, and the fact that we are gathered here now--shocked, but composed and determined--is a sign not only that this attack has failed, but that all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail.'' [http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=105763]

In September 1986, [[Patrick_Magee_(bomber)|Patrick Magee]], then aged 35, was found guilty of planting the bomb, exploding it, and of five counts of [[murder|murder]]. Magee had stayed in the hotel under the false name of Roy Walsh three weeks prior to the conference and planted the bomb, with a long-delay timer, in his room, number 629. Sir Donald Maclean was staying in the room with his wife, Muriel, when the bomb exploded. She was killed in the explosion and Sir Donald seriously injured. The other victims killed by the blast were Eric Taylor and Jeanne Shattock. Thirty-four people were hospitalized but recovered from their injuries. Magee received eight [[life_sentence|life sentence]]s: seven for offences relating to the Brighton bombing, and the eighth for a separate bombing conspiracy. The judge recommended he serve a minimum term of 35 years. Later [[Home_Secretary|Home Secretary]] [[Michael_Howard|Michael Howard]] increased this minimum to "whole life". However, he was released from prison in 1999, having served only 14 years in prison (including the time before his sentencing), under the terms of the [[Good_Friday_agreement|Good Friday agreement]]. A Downing Street spokesperson said that his release "was hard to stomach" and an appeal by then Home Secretary [[Jack_Straw_(politician)|Jack Straw]] to prevent it was turned down by the [[Northern_Ireland|Northern Ireland]] High Court. 

Following his release Magee was reported to have said "I stand by what I did," inflaming the anger of survivors and the bereaved towards him. Whilst he admitted partial responsibility for planning the attack, he maintains that the fingerprint evidence found on a registration card recovered from the hotel was faked - "If that was my fingerprint I did not put it there," he said in a newspaper interview after his release.-->
