'''拜仁·班哲文·史托克'''（{{lang-en|'''Brian Benjamin Stock'''}}，{{bd|1981年|12月24日|catidx=Stock, Brian}}）出生於[[英格蘭|英格蘭]][[東南英格蘭|東南部]][[漢普郡|漢普郡]][[郡治|郡治]][[温彻斯特|温彻斯特]]，是一名[[威爾斯|威爾斯]][[足球|足球]][[運動員|運動員]]，司職[[中场|中场]]，現時效力[[英冠|英冠]]球會[[伯恩利足球俱乐部|般尼]]，亦曾是[[威爾斯足球代表隊|威爾斯]]國腳。

==球員生涯==
===球會===
<!--
;般尼茅夫
Stock started his career at [[A.F.C._Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] making his league début on the 22 January 2000 against [[Colchester_United_F.C.|Colchester United]].

He played 145 league games and scored 16 goals for [[A.F.C._Bournemouth|Bournemouth]] before signing initially on loan to [[Preston_North_End_F.C.|Preston North End]] in January 2006.

;普雷斯頓
Preston reportedly paid £125,000 for the midfielder. Stock scored his first and what turned out to be only Preston goal in a 2–0 win over Leeds United.<ref>{{cite web

|title=Preston 2–0 Leeds 
|publisher=[[BBC|BBC]] 
|date=30 April 2006 |accessdate=10 February 2010}}</ref>

Lack of first team opportunities however lead to Stock being loaned out to [[Doncaster_Rovers_F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] in September 2006.

;唐卡士打
He then signed for Doncaster on 3 January 2007 for £150,000.

Stock played a vital role in Doncaster's 2007–08 promotion season with assured performances in midfield. He filled in as captain for Doncaster in the final two months of the season due to a foot injury to usual skipper [[Adam_Lockwood|Adam Lockwood]]. Stock captained the side in their Play-Off Final victory over [[Leeds_United_A.F.C.|Leeds United]] at Wembley, and scored the first goal from the penalty spot against Southend in the semi-finals of that Play-Off campaign. Stock is also known for possessing a deadly long range shot and is also a composed penalty taker.

In the wake of promotion to the Championship, Stock extended his contract with Doncaster keeping him at the club until 2011.

On 14 May, it was reported that [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C.|Wolves]] had enquired about Stock's availability for a reported £2.5 million. However it was proved that there was no truth in the enquiry and Stock has pledged his future to the club.
