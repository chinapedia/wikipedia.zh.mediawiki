本頁為MediaWiki[[mw:Extension:SpamBlacklist|垃圾連結黑名單擴充功能]]的關連頁面，其文字字串列表會覆寫元維基的[[meta:Spam_blacklist|黑名單]]及本地的[[MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist|黑名單]]。任何[[Wikipedia:管理員|管理員]]可以編輯本頁的垃圾連結白名單。Please post comments to the appropriate section below: [[#Proposed additions to Whitelist (web pages to unblock)|Proposed additions]] (web pages to unblock), [[#Proposed removals from whitelist (sites to reblock)|Proposed removals]] (sites to reblock), or [[#Troubleshooting_and_problems|Troubleshooting and problems]]; read the messageboxes at the top of each section for an explanation. See also [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist]].

Please enter your requests at the '''bottom''' of the [[#Proposed additions to Whitelist (web pages to unblock)|Proposed additions to Whitelist]] section and '''not at the very bottom of the page'''. '''Sign''' your requests with four tildes: <nowiki>~~~~</nowiki>

Also in your request, please include the following
# The link that you want whitelisted in the section title, like <nowiki> === example.com/help/index.php === </nowiki>.  
# The Wikipedia page on which you want to use the link
# An explanation why it would be useful to the encyclopedia article proper
# If the site you're requesting is listed at [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist/Common requests|/Common requests]], please include confirmation that you have read the reason why requests regarding the site are commonly denied and that you still desire to proceed with your request

'''Important:''' You must provide a full link to the specific web page you want to be whitelisted ('''leave out the <code>http://</code> from the front; otherwise you will not be able to save your edit to this page'''). Requests quoting only a domain (i.e. ending in <code>.com</code> or similar with nothing after the <code>/</code> character) are likely to be denied. If you wish to have a site fully unblocked please visit the relevant section of [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-blacklist]].

'''Note:''' do '''not''' request links to be whitelisted where you can reasonably suspect that the material you want to link to is in violation of copyright (see [[WP:LINKVIO]]).  Such requests will likely be summarily rejected.

There is no automated notification system in place for the results of requests, and you will '''not be notified''' when your request has a response. You should therefore add this page to your personal watch list or check back here every few days to see if there is any progress on it; in particular, you should check whether administrators have raised any additional queries or expressed any concerns about the request, as failure to reply to these promptly will generally result in the request being denied.

Completed requests are [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist/Archives|archived]],  additions and removal are [[MediaWiki_talk:Spam-whitelist/Log|logged]]. →<small style="color:gray;" id="oldid">snippet for [[MediaWiki talk:Spam-whitelist/Log|logging]]: <nowiki>{{/request|</nowiki>{{REVISIONID}}<nowiki>#section_name}}</nowiki></small>

Note that requests from new or unregistered users are not usually considered.

Admins: use [https://tools.wmflabs.org/searchsbl/?userdeflang=en seth's tool] to search the spamlists.
