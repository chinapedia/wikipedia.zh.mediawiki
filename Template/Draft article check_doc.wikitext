DraftChecker is a template to alert editors to the existence of relevant articles or drafts.  
* In '''Draft''' or '''Draft_Talk''',  DraftChecker will check for an '''Article''' of the same title.  
* In '''Article_Talk''', DraftChecker will check for a '''Draft''' of the same title. 
* In the '''Article''' namespace, Draftchecker will check for a '''Draft''' of the same title, but '''will only show a message if''' a custom javascript determines the user is logged in.  

== 使用方法 ==
'''<nowiki>{{Draft article check}}</nowiki>'''

==技術細節==
* The messages displayed are stored in sub-templates [[Template:DraftChecker/ArticleFound|/ArticleFound]], [[Template:DraftChecker/DraftFound|/DraftFound]], and [[Template:DraftChecker/ArticleNotFound|/ArticleNotFound]].
* This template calls two sub-templates: [[Template:DraftChecker/CheckForDraft|/CheckForDraft]] and [[Template:DraftChecker/CheckForArticle|/CheckForArticle]]

==Logged-in Editors -vs- Anonymous Readers==
In order for logged-in editors to view '''DraftChecker''''s links in the main Article namespace, two lines of javascript code must be installed: the [[User:HectorMoffet/ShowOnlyToLoggedInUsers.js|ShowOnlyToLoggedInUsers.js]] script.       

While '''DraftChecker''' is in development, you can install this script by adding the following line to [[Special:MyPage/common.js|your common.js file]]:
:importScript('[[User:HectorMoffet/ShowOnlyToLoggedInUsers.js]]');

In the future, the [[User:HectorMoffet/ShowOnlyToLoggedInUsers.js|ShowOnlyToLoggedInUsers.js script]] could become a [[Wikipedia:Gadget|Gadget]] enabled by default, or its two lines of code could be  incorporated into Wikipedia's default javascript file ([[MediaWiki:Common.js]]).

==Test Cases==
As of 15:43, 23 December 2013 (UTC), the following testcases passed:  (altering the text/existence of relevant pages in future may alter the results)
* [[Draft:Example]] should show a link to the corresponding Wikipedia article 
* [[Draft talk:Example]] should show a link to the corresponding Wikipedia article
* [[Talk:Example]] should show a link to the corresponding Draft .
* If you are '''not logged-in''', then the Wikipedia article [[Example]] should NOT show any links to drafts. (Although the html source should show an element with the style "visiblity: hidden;")  
* if you are '''logged-in''', (and '''[[User:HectorMoffet/ShowOnlyToLoggedInUsers.js|ShowOnlyToLoggedInUsers.js]] is installed'''), then the Wikipedia article [[Example]] SHOULD show a link to the corresponding draft. 

* [[Draft:DraftcheckerNullTest]] and [[Draft talk:DraftcheckerNullTest]] should report the non-existence of the corresponding article. 
* [[Kierkegaard (disambiguation)]] and [[Talk:Kierkegaard (disambiguation)]] should not report anything.
* [[Wikipedia:Example]] should not report anything.
