This template is part of the WikiProject Ships ship infobox.  It adds a Career box to the infobox.  Each section, except Infobox Ship Begin, can be repeated as necessary to support multiple careers, multiple sets of characteristics, etc.  The header of the Career box can be hidden by setting its "Hide header=yes".  This allows you to repeat certain fields by adding a second Career box with a hidden header.
