===History===
Adapted from [[:Template:IPvandal]] for use with IP accounts not involving vandalism -- mostly working with [[WP:WPSPAM|WikiProject Spam]]. Since so much inappropriate linking is done in good faith and therefore not necessarily spamming, the template is not incorporating a pejorative name such as vandal or spam. Several changes:
* Deleted the "block user" function (admins only)
*: "deleted contribs" added later for any admins that want to check this
* Added a "traceroute" link
* Added CompleteWhois search (searches external blacklists such as Spamhaus)
*: Sometimes doesn't respond
*: Results sometimes require interpretation -- for instance, dynamic IPs are ''not'' open proxies, zombie PCs, or some other evil; all phone modems and many other connections use dynamic IPs
* Added ippages.com -- similar to CompleteWhois, also requires interpretation
* Added robtex.com -- similar to CompleteWhois, also requires interpretation
*: Sometimes doesn't respond
* {{s|Gave the stuff in parentheses a small font}} ''(became too small)''
* Added in "tor"
* Added in Google search from [[:Template:Proxyip2]]
* Added "what links to user page"
* Added "count" - Interiot's edit count tool from [[:Template:User6]]
* "user page logs" - block log, etc.
* "x-wiki" - search contributions on all 700+ [[Wikimedia Foundation]] projects
*: Uses https://tools.wmflabs.org/guc/index.php
* AboutUs link checks for any contributions by this IP to the AboutUs.org SEO directory of domains; if so, this can be useful in finding additional domains that may have been spammed

===Future===
* Add link to the tester on the open proxy project on Wikipedia
* Readd block user link
