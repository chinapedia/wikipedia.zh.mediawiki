== Usage ==
The purpose of the '''{{tl|Television crossover note}}''' template is to add a note into the episode summary of the television crossover episodes, noting the crossover and other episodes contained within it.

==Syntax==
Unnamed parameters should provide links to the episodes of the crossover, in the order that they aired. When the template is placed in an episode's summary, a plain hyphen (<code><nowiki>-</nowiki></code>) should be used instead of a link to represent that particular episode. See the example below.

==Example==
In the 2016 three-part crossover, the episodes aired in the order of ''The Flash'', then ''Arrow'', then ''Legends of Tomorrow''.

This is the syntax you would use for the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode summary: The first parameter contains a link for ''The Flash'' episode, the second parameter contains a link for the ''Arrow'' episode, and the third parameter contains a hyphen in place of the ''Legends of Tomorrow'' episode.

<code><nowiki>{{Television crossover note|[[List of The Flash episodes#ep54|''The Flash'' season 3 episode 8]]|[[List of Arrow episodes#ep100|''Arrow'' season 5 episode 8]]|-}}</nowiki></code>

The result is: {{Television crossover note|[[List of The Flash episodes#ep54|''The Flash'' season 3 episode 8]]|[[List of Arrow episodes#ep100|''Arrow'' season 5 episode 8]]|-}}
