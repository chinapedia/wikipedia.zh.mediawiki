== 用法 ==
To add this template to a page with a running translation, please use the following template code at the top of the page in question:

 <nowiki>{{Translation_WIP|ArticleName|FromLanguage|FLSC}}</nowiki>

'''Notes:'''
*'''ArticleName''' corresponds to the original name of the article. The original (To and From) pages should both be listed by the same or equivalent names.
*'''FromLanguage''' is the full name of the source language, I.E: [[German language|German]].
*'''FLSC''' (FromLanguageShortCode) is the [[iso639|ISO 639]] short code for the source language, ''e.g.'': Use [[de]] for [[German language|German]].<br/>

This template will categorize tagged articles into [[:Category:Articles in translation]].

== Example ==
To show that the current page is a translation of the [[Transrapid]] article from the [[:de:Transrapid|German Wikipedia]], the following code would be used:<br />
:<code><nowiki>{{Translation_WIP|Transrapid|German|de}}</nowiki></code>
