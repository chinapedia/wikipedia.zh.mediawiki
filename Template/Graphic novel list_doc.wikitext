==Usage==
This template is part of a family of templates, and should be used in conjunction with {{tl|Graphic novel list/header}} and {{tl|Graphic novel list/footer}}, like so:
<pre>{{Graphic novel list/header
 | parameter = value
}}
{{Graphic novel list
 | parameter = value
}}
{{Graphic novel list/footer}}</pre>

==Parameters==
{| class="wikitable" width="99%"
 ! style="text-align: center" | Parameter !! style="text-align: center" | Use
|-
 | colspan="2" style="text-align: center; background: #F5F5F5" | {{tl|Graphic novel list/header}}<br /><small>All of this template's parameters are optional.</small>
|-
 | 譯本
 | '''Values:''' "yes" (case-sensitive)<br />When this parameter is set to "yes", this template will produce a three- or four-column view, ideal for displaying information when only the original language has a release.  Setting this to anything else or omitting it entirely will produce a four- or five-column view, ideal for displaying information about original-language and licensed-language releases.
|-
 | 語言
 | '''Values:''' any<br />This is the language of origin.  In three-column views, this defaults to nothing; in five-column views, this defaults to "Original".
|-
 | 語言2
 | '''Values:''' any<br />This is the licensed language. This displays only in five-column views, where it defaults to "English".
|-
 | 寬度
 | '''Values:''' an integer number greater than zero or a percentage from 0% to 100%<br />Determines the 寬度 of the table.  Defaults to "98%".
|-
 | 顏色
 | '''Values:''' a hex color value of the form "RGB" or "RRGGBB"<br />To separate the header from the main body of the table, a three-pixel colored border is added to the bottom; this determines the color of the border.  Defaults to "CCF".
|-
 | 顯示標題
 | '''Values:''' "yes" (case-sensitive)<br />When this parameter is set to "yes", this template will produce a four-column view, ideal for displaying information when the individual volumes have names. Setting this to anything else or omitting it entirely will produce a three- or five-column view, ideal for displaying information about volumes without names.
|-
 | Clear
 | '''Values:''' "no"<br />When this parameter is set, this template will not automatically clear floating tables and divs (this effect can also be achieved by setting a custom 寬度).
|-
 | colspan="2" style="text-align: center; background: #F5F5F5" | {{tl|Graphic novel list}}
|-
 | 集數
 | '''Values:''' any valid HTML ID (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _, -, :, .), usually numeric<br />A volume number.  This parameter also creates an HTML anchor which can be linked to from other pages, prefixed with "vol"; for example, <code><nowiki>[[List of chapters#vol01]]</nowiki></code>.
|-
 | 系列<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' any valid HTML ID<br />A non-printing parameter which is prefixed to the HTML anchor ID defined by 集數; for example, if defined as "alt" with a 集數 of "02", the anchor becomes "#altvol02".
|-
 | 發售日期<br />發售日期1<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' any, usually a date<br />The release date of the original-language work.  Both parameters define the same thing.  If more than one release date is necessary, separate each with <code><nowiki><br /></nowiki></code>.
|-
 | 發售日期2<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' any, usually a date<br />The release date of the licensed-language work.  If more than one release date is necessary, separate each with <code><nowiki><br /></nowiki></code>.<br />If both 發售日期2 and ISBN2 are emtpy, the template will yield output appropriate for one-language view. Manually insert [[em-dash]]es (—) to overcome this, if a two-language view is desired.
|-
 | ISBN<br />ISBN1<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' a valid ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 number<br />The ISBN of the original-language work.  This should be only the number; the template prefixes ISBN automatically, to link it with [[Special:Booksources]].  If more than one ISBN is necessary, separate each with <code><nowiki><br /></nowiki></code> and add "ISBN" to all but the first.
|-
 | ISBN2<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' a valid ISBN-10 or ISBN-13 number<br />The ISBN of the licensed-language work.  As with ISBN/ISBN1, this should only be the number, unless more than one ISBN is present.<br />If both 發售日期2 and ISBN2 are emtpy, the template will yield output appropriate for one-language view. Manually insert [[em-dash]]es (—) to overcome this, if a two-language view is desired.
|-
 | ChapterList<br />ChapterListCol1<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' a formatted list of chapters<br />A list of chapters from the volume, with specific chapter names in quotation marks.<br />If ChapterListCol2 is defined, this will occupy just over half its row; otherwise, it will occupy an entire row.
|-
 | ChapterListCol2<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' a formatted list of chapters<br />A second list of chapters from the volume, with specific chapter names in quotation marks.<br />If ChapterList or ChapterListCol1 is defined, this will occupy just under half its row; otherwise, it will not be displayed.
|-
 | 摘要<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' any<br />A 摘要 of the volume.<br />Occupies an entire row.
|-
 | 顏色<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' a hex color value of the form "RGB" or "RRGGBB"<br />In a table containing a chapter list and/or a 摘要, three-pixel colored borders are added to the bottoms of individual volume releases to separate them; this determines the color of the border.  Defaults to "CCF".
|-
 | 標題1<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' any<br />The original language title of the volume. Use only if [[transliteration]] is required.<br />If all title parameters are empty, the template will yield output appropriate for three- or four-column view.
|-
 | 意譯標題<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' any<br />The original language title of the volume, [[Transliteration|transliterated]] if necessary.<br />If all title parameters are empty, the template will yield output appropriate for three- or four-column view.
|-
 | 標題<br />標題2<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' any<br />The title of the volume in its licensed release.<br />If all title parameters are empty, the template will yield output appropriate for three- or four-column view. 
|-
 | SublistOf<br /><small>(Optional)</small>
 | '''Values:''' any<br />If this matches the name of the page the table is displayed on, for example through [[Wikipedia:transclusion|transclusion]], chapter lists and summaries are hidden.
|-
 | colspan="2" style="text-align: center; background: #F5F5F5" | {{tl|Graphic novel list/footer}}<br /><small>This template has no parameters.</small>

==Notes==
*ISBNs may be given in either unhyphenated format (for example, 9781000000009) or hyphenated format (978-1-00-000000-9).  If converting an unhyphenated ISBN to a hyphenated one, you can use the [http://www.isbn-international.org/converter/ranges.htm reference list of group and publisher numbers], provided by the International ISBN Agency, or one of several [http://www.bisg.org/isbn-13/converters.html online converters].
*Apostrophes in the {{para|SublistOf}} parameter need to be replaced by <code>&amp;#39;</code> due to a bug in the underlying software.
