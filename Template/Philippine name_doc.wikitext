{{Documentation subpage}}
This template is for use with Philippine (Philippine and Spanish) names that use non-Western European characters, but which are commonly transliterated in plain English characters (e.g. "ñ" simplified to "n").  The article is often but not always named with the Western European simpification, but sometimes vice versa.  This template is suitable for either case.  

Usage example (note that the correct spelling is entered first):
* {{tlx|Philippine name|Peñalosa|Penalosa}} &rarr; {{Philippine name|Peñalosa|Penalosa}}
