<!-- Most of this template was based on the similar [[Template:ITunes Preview App|iTunes App Store Preview]] template -->

This is a template to generate links to the [[Windows Phone Store]]. This template should only be used for '''Apps+Games''' on the[[Windows Phone Store]] and not the [[Microsoft商店|Windows Store]].

== Usage ==

# Go to the app's page on the Windows Phone Store website.
# Copy the app's '''id''' (and optionally the '''slug''') in the URL. The format for the URL would be something like http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/########/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX, where the '''XX''' section after the last'''/''' indicates the '''''id''''' and the '''##''' section just before the ''id'' indicates the '''slug''' of the app.
# Add the template to the ''External Links'' section of the page in the following format: {{tlx|Windows Phone Store|XXXXX|#####}} or by explicitly naming the parameters {{tlx|Windows Phone Store|id{{=}}XXXXX|slug{{=}}#####|title{{=}}App Title}}.

== Parameters ==

The template has support for a number of different parameters and only the first one is required to identify the app. Parameters can be named explicitly, or given in the following order:

* '''id''': The [[通用唯一识别码|GUID]] of the application given in the store listing URL. The last section of the URL (http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/########/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX) represented by Xs defines the GUID of the app. For example, in http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/wikipedia/fd40c569-2681-48df-9ff3-53ffd80aa9b5, the ''id'' is ''fd40c569-2681-48df-9ff3-53ffd80aa9b5''.
* '''slug''': The string based slug of the application given in the store listing URL. The second last section of the URL (http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/########/XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX) represented by #s defines the slug of the app. Its value is actually ignored when the URL is parsed on the Windows Phone Store. For example, in http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/wikipedia/fd40c569-2681-48df-9ff3-53ffd80aa9b5, the ''slug'' is ''wikipedia''.
* '''title''': The title of the app. This parameter will default to the title of the current page if omitted.
* '''description''': A brief and optional description of the application.

== Example ==

To add the template to the [[WhatsApp]] page, open the [http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/whatsapp/218a0ebb-1585-4c7e-a9ec-054cf4569a79 Windows Phone Store listing] for WhatsApp and copy the '''id''' and '''slug''' as outlined above. Then add the following template code to the [[WhatsApp|External Links]] section of the page.

::{{tlx|Windows Phone Store|218a0ebb-1585-4c7e-a9ec-054cf4569a79}}

This will generate a link which looks something like the following:

::{{Windows Phone Store|id=218a0ebb-1585-4c7e-a9ec-054cf4569a79|title=WhatsApp}}

Similarly, to add an external link to [http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/halo-spartan-asslt/8e162189-0baf-431e-966a-0d050eac9aab Halo: Spartan Assault listing] on the [[最後一戰系列|Halo (series)]] page, add the following template code:

::{{tlx|Windows Phone Store|id{{=}}8e162189-0baf-431e-966a-0d050eac9aab|title{{=}}Halo: Spartan Assault|slug{{=}}halo-spartan-asslt|description{{=}}Halo: Spartan Assault brings the excitement of Halo combat to touch-based devices for the very first time. Battle your way through 25 action-packed missions against the Covenant as you explore the origin of the Spartan Ops program.}}

This will generate the following link:

::{{Windows Phone Store|id=8e162189-0baf-431e-966a-0d050eac9aab|title=Halo: Spartan Assault|slug=halo-spartan-asslt|description=Halo: Spartan Assault brings the excitement of Halo combat to touch-based devices for the very first time. Battle your way through 25 action-packed missions against the Covenant as you explore the origin of the Spartan Ops program.}}
