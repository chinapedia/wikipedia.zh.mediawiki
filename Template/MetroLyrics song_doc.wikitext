This template is designed to link to the lyrics page for a particular song or track on their site, and is intended to be used in the \"External links\" section.\n\nNote that you should only link to MetroLyrics pages that are locked. Since the LyricFind \"LF\" logo is no longer used to indicate licensed lyrics, one must:\n\n- Click on \"edit lyrics\" (on the upper right hand side of the lyrics page) to see if \"Locked\" is displayed.\n\n- If this is missing and/or displays \"Edit – click here to add some lyrics\", the page may include user-contributed content, and is in all likelihood a copyright violation.\n\nPer WP:ELNEVER, we must not link to copyright violations.
