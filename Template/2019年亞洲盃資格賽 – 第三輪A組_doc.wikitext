== Full table ==
{{2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification – Third Round Group A table|show_matches=yes}}

== Usage ==
This template is designed to collect information, which is used in several articles, in one location. The [[2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification]] group tables are shown on the overall qualifying page and the page for this particular round ([[2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification – Third Round]]), if not other pages as well. This template should replace the need to update the same information on several pages.

===In article===
To add this table to an article, type {{tl|2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification – Third Round Group A table}}.

===Editing===
Until the first match starts, the {{para|update}} and {{para|start_date}} should indicate the date of the first match. Once the qualifying campaign starts, remove the {{para|start_date}} parameter and set {{para|update}} to the appropriate date of the last date for which the matches are included.

====During tournament====
After each match, update the table and ensure the order of teams and the {{para|update}} parameter are also updated. For example:
{| class="wikitable" style="background:white;"

To change the order of the teams, set {{para|team1}} to the team in first place in the group, {{para|team2}} to the team in second place, etc. The order of data entry does not need to be changed. The status of team TTT can also be set during the qualifying stage if the outcome is known:
*If a team will definitely qualify to the final tournament, set {{para|status_TTT|Q}}
*If a team will definitely be eliminated, set {{para|status_TTT|E}}

;Matches
Also update the match results with the {{para|match_AAA_BBB}} inputs, the first team is the home team, the second team the away team.

====After qualifying stage is complete====
When the group is complete, set {{para|update|complete}}. After all groups are finished, the parameters {{para|status_TTT|Q}} and {{para|status_TTT|E}} may be removed across all groups, as the outcome of the group stage is evidenced by the row color and the last column.

==Display options==
If a smaller displayed table is desired, the parameter {{para|only_pld_pts}} can be defined in the template call to display only the position, team, games played, and points columns. This display may be desired when multiple groups must be displayed, but the full details are not required. Valid values of {{para|only_pld_pts}} to display a truncated table are '''1''', '''yes''', '''y''', '''true''', and '''t'''. The matches table can be included by the same valid entries for {{para|show_matches}}. A team can be highlighted by setting {{para|showteam|TTT}}, with TTT the team code for that team.

==Additional information==
Additional information regarding how this module works is available in the documentation of [[Module:Sports table]].
