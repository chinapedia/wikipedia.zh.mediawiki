''[[告示牌 (雜誌)|Billboard]]'' magazine indexes the artists on their website by a number called the '''artist ID'''. Each individual artist has a single identification number through which all chart history can be tracked form inside and outside the website. This template is used to support {{tl|singlechart}}, {{tl|albumchart}}, and {{tl|BillboardURLbyName}}.

Internally, it uses forty subtemplates, split by the first character of the artist's name. This prevents the system from needing to load the entire translation table every time the system.

The following template compiles the artists and their respective IDs, and provides the ID when called with a supported artist's name. It is a reasonably complete list (as of 11 February 2012 it includes over 30,000 artists) and anyone can help adding or asking missing IDs to it.

==Usage==
Copy and paste one of the following onto the {{tlc|Singlechart}} or {{tlc|Albumchart}} templates when calling a Billboard chart, replacing ''Artistname'' with the artist whom chart history you are consulting:
:*<code><nowiki>{{BillboardID|Artistname}}</nowiki></code>
:*<code><nowiki>{{BillboardID|}}</nowiki></code>
Alternately, it can also be written:
:*<code><nowiki>{{BBID|Artistname}}</nowiki></code>
:*<code><nowiki>{{BBID|}}</nowiki></code>

==Example==
The template might be used the following way: On the {{tl|Singlechart}} or {{tl|Albumchart}}, when calling ''Billboard'' charts, do the next:
*Usually, those templates might be called as this:
:*<code><nowiki>{{albumchart|Billboard200|10|artist=Gotye|artistid=</nowiki>'''619936'''<nowiki>|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</nowiki></code>
:*<code><nowiki>{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Gotye|artistid=</nowiki>'''619936'''<nowiki>|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</nowiki></code>
*Instead, using this template, it might be called as this:
:*<code><nowiki>{{albumchart|Billboard200|10|artist=Gotye|artistid=</nowiki>'''<nowiki>{{BillboardID|Gotye}}</nowiki>'''<nowiki>|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</nowiki></code>
:*<code><nowiki>{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Gotye|artistid=</nowiki>'''<nowiki>{{BillboardID|Gotye}}</nowiki>'''<nowiki>|accessdate=2 June 2012}}</nowiki></code>

*As an example (using the template):
{| class="wikitable sortable" border="1"
|-
! style="width: 12em;"| Chart
! Peak<br/>position
|-
{{singlechart|Billboardhot100|1|artist=Gotye|artistid={{BillboardID|Gotye}}|accessdate=2 June 2012}}
|-
|}
{| class="wikitable sortable" border="1"
|-
! style="width: 12em;"| Chart
! Peak<br/>position
|-
{{albumchart|Billboard200|10|refname=Gotye|artist=Gotye|artistid={{BillboardID|Gotye}}|accessdate=2 June 2012}}
|-
|}
{{reflist}}

=== What if it doesn't work? ===
The usual problem is going to be that you didn't match the artist name on Billboard. Billboard is ''picky''! "Selena Gomez & the Scene" is ''not'' the same as "Selena Gomez and the Scene". "Ana Belén" and "Ana Belen" are not the same. So, double check your name.


If that doesn't help, the problem probably lies in {{tl|BillboardID}}. Fixing it is simple:
#Go find your artist's list of charts on Billboard.
#Look at the URL. Again, looking at {{BillboardURLbyName|artist=Shakira|chart=Hot 100}} you will see that big number:{{trim|{{BillboardID|Shakira}}}}. That's the magic number we need.
#Edit the appropriate child of {{tl|BillboardID}}. For Shakira, that's {{tl|BillboardID/S}}, because "Shakira" begins with an "S".
#Insert the line. Again, using Shakira as an example, it's
<!-- Don't use the source as a guide, use the display. This markup won't work as source -->#:{{!}}<!-- Don't use the source as a guide, use the display. This markup won't work as source -->shakira<!-- Don't use the source as a guide, use the display. This markup won't work as source --> = {{trim|{{BillboardID|Shakira}}}} <!-- Don't use the source as a guide, use the display. This markup won't work as source -->
#:''Pay attention to the case. It has to be '''lower case''' inside the template.''
#Now try again. Please doublecheck a few artists' articles that begin with the same letter and make sure you didn't break them. You can easily break hundreds of articles by inserting an error in the BillboardID templates, so be careful.

If you can't figure it out, drop a note at [[Template talk:BillboardID]], and someone will come help.
