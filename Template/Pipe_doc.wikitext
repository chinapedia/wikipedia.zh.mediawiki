This is the {{tl|pipe}} meta-template. It looks like this: {{pipe}}

This template uses the <tt><nowiki>&amp;#124;</nowiki></tt> [[List of XML and HTML character entity references|decimal code]] for the [[vertical bar]] (or pipe character) so that its usage doesn't cause problems when it is used inside a [[Help:Template|template]]. This situation most commonly arises when the title of a cited reference contains a pipe character instead of a hyphen or dash (e.g. [http://www.xbox.com/ Xbox.com {{pipe}} Xbox.com Home]). <code>{{tl|Pipe}}</code> is easier to remember and clearer than an unadorned <tt><nowiki>&amp;#124;</nowiki></tt>.

Please do not use the Unicode <tt><nowiki>&amp;#448;</nowiki></tt> (which produces &#448;) since that does not work in all web browsers. It is also slightly smaller than &#124;.

=== Alternative names ===

The following names redirect here and can be used as alternative names for this template:
* {{tl|divider line}}
* {{tl|vbar}}
* {{tl|verti-bar}}
* {{tl|vertical bar}}
* {{tl|vertical line}}
* {{tl|vertical slash}}

=== See also ===

* {{tn|!}} - Used to encode "|" within template parameters or wikitables. Note that this one looks the same but has a very different meaning for the MediaWiki parser and thus has different functionality.
* {{tn|'}} - Used to encode apostrophe to keep it separate from <code><nowiki>''</nowiki></code> and <code><nowiki>'''</nowiki></code> markup.
