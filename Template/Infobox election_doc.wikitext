== 注意 ==
本模板最多可顯示9個政黨或候選人，每行3個。如果只需顯示4個，在最後帶數字編號的參數項可以只使用[參數名1]、[參數名2]、[參數名4]和[參數名5]。

All the fields that work for Legislative will also work for Parliamentary. The only difference between the two is the titles above the images.

The template uses the party fields to display the party colour in the background of the images and some text. To turn this function off, input:
 | party_colour      = no
To override the calling of the party short name templates, input:
 | party_name        = no
To override the calling of the alliance short name templates, input:
 | alliance_name     = no
To override the colour for party1 or nominee1, input:
 | colour1           = [HEX OF COLOUR, MINUS #]
The hex number must be entered without the hash for the field to work. The number (colour'''1''') can be changed up to nine for different parties or Nominees. The fields work with both spellings of the word 'color'.
