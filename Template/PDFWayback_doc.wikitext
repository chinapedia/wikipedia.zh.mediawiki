{{tl|{{PAGENAME}}}} highlights that a link points to a [[PDF]] document, which is located at the [[Internet Archive]] "Wayback Machine" (on some systems PDF files may take time to download and display within the browser, and their use on many websites is not compliant with the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]]).

=== Usage ===

<nowiki>{{PDFWayback|url=}}</nowiki>

<nowiki>{{PDFWayback|url=|title=|date=|size=}}</nowiki>

;url: The URL of the PDF file that is being referenced in the Internet Archives.
;title <span style="font-weight:normal;">(optional)</span>: The text label for the external link. If this is omitted, a generic "Archive copy" label will be used.
;date <span style="font-weight:normal;">(optional, but recommend)</span>: The Internet Archive timestamp (<code>YYYYMMDDhhmmss</code>) for the date of the archived PDF file that is to be displayed.  If omitted, the history of the referenced page will be listed instead.  You must use the full 4 digits for the year and 2 digits for month, day, hour, minute and second. Use leading zeros if necessary and the 24-hour time format.
;size <span style="font-weight:normal;">(optional, but recommend)</span>: The size of the PDF file that is being referenced in the Internet Archives.
