{{documentation subpage}}

Use this template freely for any drug class article.

=== Usage ===

The template does not at the current time include summary information about the drug class itself. Instead, it contains a consistent interface to other sources that provide information about the drug class. Don't worry about trying to fill in all the fields &ndash; even if you can only get one or two, that still can be useful.

While editing an article about a drug class, copy and paste the following text at the top of the page:

{{Infobox drug class
| Name              = {{{Name}}}
| Image             = {{{Image}}}
| Alt               = {{{Alt}}}
| Caption           = {{{Caption}}}
| Use               = {{{Use}}}
| Biological_target = {{{Biological_target}}}
| ATC_prefix        = {{{ATC_prefix}}}
| MeshID            = {{{MeshID}}}
| Drugs.com         = {{{Drugs.com}}}
| Consumer_Reports  = {{{Consumer_Reports}}}
| medicinenet       = {{{medicinenet}}}
| rxlist            = {{{rxlist}}}
}}

<pre style="overflow: auto">
