{{Intricate template}}

Other alternatives are available through {{tl|Ref}}, {{tl|Note}}, {{tl|Ref label}}, {{tl|Note label}}, {{tl|Cref}}, {{tl|Cnote}}, and so on. This template is the most comprehensive. Articles are often built upon precedent, how one article serves as an example for another. For a list of articles that use this template, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Cnote2&namespace=0&hideredirs=1&hidelinks=1&limit=500 see here].

This template is used in together with:

* [[Template:Cref2]]
* [[Template:Cnote2]]
* [[Template:Cnote2 Begin]]
* [[Template:Cnote2 End]]

==Purpose==
This template is used to supplement the <nowiki><reference /></nowiki> tag, which does not provide options for: (1) list style, (2) list sequence, (3) hidden groupings, and (4) nesting. It is designed for explanatory notes, however it may also be used for referencing.

The [[Help:Footnotes|Footnotes]] system now includes:

* list style— [[WP:CITELABEL]]
* groups— [[WP:REFGROUP]]
* nesting— [[WP:REFNEST]]

==Parameters==

===Cref2===
Cref2 is placed inline with the text, there are three parameters. The first parameter is required, the last two are optional.
* The first parameter is the '''target''', and must correspond with the one used for Cnote2.
* The second optional parameter specifies the '''occurrence'''; for example, some articles require more than one inline cref to be placed in the text. Number the Cref2 in the order that they occur, starting at one; the limit is six for style purposes.
* The third optional parameter is the '''group''' from which the inline item belongs. For example, group of Cnote2 and Cref2, apply the group parameter to distinguish between each individual group.

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<pre>
{{Cref2|N}}
</pre>
<div style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fff;">
{{Cref2|N}}
</div>
</div>

If there are more than one Cref2 that needs to link to the "A" Cnote2, apply the second "occurrence" parameter.

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<pre>
first occurrence{{Cref2|A|1}} second occurrence{{Cref2|A|2}}
</pre>
<div style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fff;">
first occurrence{{Cref2|A|1}} second occurrence{{Cref2|A|2}}
</div>
</div>

If there are two groups of Cref2, you may either: (1) apply a slightly more descriptive "target", or (2) use the "group" parameter.

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<pre>
long target name;{{Cref2|nb N}} first group first occurrence;{{Cref2|N|group=1}}
second group first occurrence{{Cref2|N|1|group=2}} second{{Cref2|N|2|group=2}}
</pre>
<div style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fff;">
long target name;{{Cref2|nb N}} first group first occurrence;{{Cref2|N|group=1}}
second group first occurrence{{Cref2|N|1|group=2}} second{{Cref2|N|2|group=2}}
</div>
</div>

===Cnote2===

Cnote2 has five parameters: (1) the target, (2) the text, (3) the number, (4) the value (5) the group. The first two are required. The last three are optional. Each Cnote2 may be separated by a maximum of one line of whitespace; smaller lists may not require this separation, larger more complex lists may benefit from greater readability.

The target, which comes first, specifies ''which'' inline item, and should correspond with the Cref2 it will be linking to. The text specifies the content of the note. If any of these two required parameters are empty, an error message will appear.

Occasionally an article may have multiple inline occurrences. For example, a reference or explanatory note may be used more than once. Cnote2 is different from Cref2. "n=" the number of occurrences of Cref2. For example, if there are two occurrences, then n=2. In some cases it may be desired to remove all links to an inline occurrence, similar to either turning off the "backlinks" in [[m:Cite/Cite.php|Cite.php]], or giving the feel of a regular list; in these cases set n=0.

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<pre>
{{Cnote2 Begin}}
{{Cnote2|A|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|B|2= do this if you need to use an equal sign}}
{{Cnote2|C|n=1|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|D|n=6|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|E|n=3|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|F|n=0|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</pre>
<div style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fff;">
{{Cnote2 Begin}}
{{Cnote2|A|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|B|2= do this if you need to use an equal sign}}
{{Cnote2|C|n=1|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|D|n=6|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|E|n=3|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|F|n=0|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</div>
</div>

The fourth parameter, value=, allows the editor to interrupt the sequence from which the listed items are numbered or lettered. For example by default the order of list item goes A, B, C, D, E, F, G... or if the list style is numbered then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7... Pass a positive non-zero integer into the value= to change this sequence. For example, if a 3 was passed into the second Cnote2 then the order would go A, C, D, E, F, G, H... or 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8...

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<pre>
{{Cnote2 Begin}}
{{Cnote2|G|n=3|value=7|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|H|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|I|n=2|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|J|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</pre>
<div style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fff;">
{{Cnote2 Begin}}
{{Cnote2|G|n=3|value=7|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|H|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|I|n=2|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|J|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</div>
</div>

Some very large articles require more than one Cnote2 or Cref2 list. This parameter, group= may be accomplished with a more descriptive target, however to (1) reduce potential confusion between lists and (2) remain consistent and not change the appearance of the inline cref. Pass a string of character or character into the group parameter.

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<pre>
text{{Cref2|A|group=1}} text{{Cref2|B|group=1}}
text{{Cref2|A|group=2}} text{{Cref2|B|group=2}}

{{Cnote2 Begin}}
{{Cnote2|A|group=1|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|B|group=1|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}

{{Cnote2 Begin}}
{{Cnote2|A|n=3|group=2|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|B|n=5|group=2|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</pre>
<div style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fff;">
text{{Cref2|A|group=1}} text{{Cref2|B|group=1}}
text{{Cref2|A|group=2}} text{{Cref2|B|group=2}}

{{Cnote2 Begin}}
{{Cnote2|A|group=1|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|B|group=1|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}

{{Cnote2 Begin}}
{{Cnote2|A|n=3|group=2|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|B|n=5|group=2|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</div>
</div>

===Cnote2 Begin===

Cnote2 Begin, similar to {{tl|Refbegin}} has two parameters.

* '''colwidth''' enter the width of the dynamic column, such as ''30em''; this only works for certain web browsers. (Note, rather than using ''colwidth'', you can specify the number of columns exactly by replacing the ''colwidth=30em'' with either a "2" or "3".)
* '''liststyle''' enter the list style you wish to use, the default is ''upper-alpha''.

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<pre>
{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-roman|colwidth=30em}}
{{Cnote2|I|text text text text|group=roman sample}}
{{Cnote2|II|text text text text|group=roman sample}}
{{Cnote2|III|text text text text|group=roman sample}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</pre>
<div style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fff;">
{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-roman|colwidth=30em}}
{{Cnote2|I|text text text text|group=roman sample}}
{{Cnote2|II|text text text text|group=roman sample}}
{{Cnote2|III|text text text text|group=roman sample}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</div>
</div>

<div style="margin-left:40px;">
<pre>
{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=decimal-leading-zero|2}}
{{Cnote2|01|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|02|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|03|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</pre>
<div style="padding:5px; border:1px solid #ddd; background:#fff;">

{{Cnote2|01|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|02|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2|03|text text text text}}
{{Cnote2 End}}
</div>
</div>

{{CSS list-style-type values}}

===Cnote2 End===

Place {{tl|Cnote2 End}} at the end of the Cnote2 list.

==Example==

===Basic===

The Cnote2 template system is used similar to the &lt;reference /> tag. Place Cref2 inline and the Cnote2 in the standard appendicies. Remember to always keep Cnote2 in order, otherwise this may be confusing to the reader.

===Multiple occurrences===

References or explanatory notes should not be overused, the limit is six for style reasons. Often if the number of occurrences exceed six, editors often "turn-off the back links"; to do so in Cnote2 set n=0. This example demonstrates two occurrences and a possible use of whitespace.

Global warming is the increase in the average temperature of the
Earth's near-surface air and oceans since the mid-twentieth century
and its projected continuation. Global surface temperature increased
0.74 ± 0.18 °C (1.33 ± 0.32 °F) during the last century.{{cref2|1|1}}
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concludes that
anthropogenic greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed
temperature increase since the middle of the twentieth century,{{cref2|1|2}}
and that natural phenomena such as solar variation and volcanoes
probably had a small warming effect from pre-industrial times to
1950 and a small cooling effect afterward.{{cref2|2|1}}{{cref2|3}}
