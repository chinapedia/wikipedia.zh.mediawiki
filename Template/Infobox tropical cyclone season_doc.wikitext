! Parameter !! Type !! Description !! Example
|-
| {{{Basin}}} || Mandatory || A abbreviation denoting what basin is represented || Atl, EPac, WPac, NIO, SHem, SWI, SPac, SAtl and Aus currently defined
|-
| {{{Year}}} || Optional || The year of the season, if a multiple year span is covered, use the most recent || 2005
|-
| {{{Track}}} || Optional || The location of the track map, if present. || 2005 Atlantic hurricane season map.png
|-
| {{{Track alt}}} || Needed if {{{Track}}} is given || Alt text for the track map, for visually impaired readers; see ''[[Wikipedia:Alternative text for images]]'', particularly its ''[[Wikipedia:Alternative text for images#Maps|Maps]]'' section. || Tracks of about 28 tropical storms, including 15 hurricanes, cluster in the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico, with some scattered in the Atlantic. Seven hurricanes are major, and most of them make landfall on the U.S. Gulf coast.
|-
| {{{First storm formed}}} || Mandatory || Formation date (generally tropical storm-strength) of first storm (full date) Use {{tl|start date}} || <code><nowiki>{{start date|2005|06|08}}</nowiki></code>
|-
| {{{Last storm dissipated}}} || Mandatory || Dissipation date of last storm (full date). Use {{tl|end date}} || <code><nowiki>{{end date|2006|01|06}}</nowiki></code>
|-
| {{{Strongest storm name}}} || Mandatory || The name of the strongest storm(s). Wikilink if appropriate. || [[飓风威尔玛|威尔玛]]
|-
| {{{Strongest storm pressure}}} || Optional || The minimum pressure of the strongest storm in mbar/hPa. '''Must be a number'''. || 882
|-
| {{{Strongest storm winds}}} || Optional || The maximum windspeed of the strongest storm in knots. '''Must be a number'''. || 160
|-
| {{{Average wind speed}}} || Optional || The length of time used to find the average measurement of the storm's maximum sustained winds. || 10
|-
| {{{Total disturbances}}} || Optional || For the NIO this is defined as the number of Depressions in a season. For the rest of the basins it is the number of disturbances || 48
|-
| {{{Total depressions}}} || Optional || For the NIO this is defined as the number of Deep Depressions in a season for other basins this is the total number of depressions in a season || 31
|-
| {{{Total storms}}} || Optional || The total number of storms of at least TS strength || 28
|-
| {{{Total hurricanes}}} || Optional || The total number of hurricane-''strength'' systems || 15
|-
| {{{Total intense}}} || Optional || For all basins, the number of major storms that formed. (Major hurricanes, super typhoons, severe and intense cyclones) || 7
|-
| {{{Fatalities}}} || Optional || Total number of people killed (directly and indirectly) during the season.  Use a range of values if necessary. If not used gives "Unknown". || ≥2,280
|-
| {{{Damages}}} || Optional || Total damages from the season. This is expressed in millions of dollars in the year of the season. If not used gives "Unknown". '''If used must be a number'''. || 120000
|-
| {{{Inflated}}} || Optional || Gives the total damages from the season, in CURRENT year dollars. Use this parameter to call the number, and to state how many decimal places you want the figure to. || 2
|-
| {{{fiveseasons}}} || Mandatory || Links to the next and previous 2 seasons around this one.  In most cases this is just the previous 2 years and the following 2 years, with the current year in the center.  For multi-season articles it takes a little more thought. || [[2002年大西洋飓风季|2002]]、[[2003年大西洋飓风季|2003]]、'''2004'''、[[2005年大西洋飓风季|2005]]、[[2006年大西洋飓风季|2006]]
|-
| {{{Strongest CPac name}}} || Optional || For Pacific hurricane seasons only, the name of the strongest CPac storm. || [[颶風伊歐凱|伊歐凱]]
|-
| {{{Strongest CPac pressure}}} || Optional || As for the strongest storm, for the CPac only || 915
|-
| {{{Strongest CPac winds}}} || Optional || As for the strongest storm, for the CPac only || 140
|}

===計算===
* Pressure: If {{{basin}}} is one of Atl or EPac the template will calculate the pressure in inHg from the pressure in mbar and quote to 2dp.
* Windspeeds: The template takes parameters here in terms of knots and returns mph and km/h (the order depending on the basin). It returns these to the nearest 5.
