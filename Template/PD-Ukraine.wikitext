<hr><small>A Ukrainian or Soviet work that is in the public domain in Ukraine according to this rule is in the public domain '''''in the U.S.'' only''' if it had been in the public domain in Ukraine before January 1, 1996, e.g. if it was published '''before January 1, 1946''' ''and'' the creator died before that year, and no copyright was registered in the U.S. (This is the combined effect of the retroactive [http://www.cipr.org/legal_reference/countries/ukraine/Ukraine_Copyright_ENG.pdf Ukrainian copyright law], Ukraine's joining the [[:en:Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] in 1996, and of [http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#104a 17 USC 104A] with its critical date of January 1, 1996.)</small>}}
