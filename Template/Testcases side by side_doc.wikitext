This template is designed to provide side-by-side comparisons of template and sandbox code on the '''<code>/testcases</code>''' sub-page for a given template.

=== 用途 ===
<pre>
{{ Testcases side by side
| {{Template 1 |parameter1 |parameter2 |etc}}
| {{Template 1/sandbox |parameter1 |parameter2 |etc}}
}}
</pre>

=== 參數 ===
The template accepts three unnamed parameters, the first two of which should be the full code of the templates to be compared. The third allows for the comparison table to be centrally aligned: simply pass "center" as the third attribute, using: '''<code>|center</code>'''

Named parameters are:

*'''t1''': title for template 1, formatted as a template using '''{{tlc|tl}}'''; defaults to '''{{tlc|BASEPAGE}}
*'''t2''': title for template 2, formatted as a template using '''{{tlc|tl}}'''; defaults to '''{{tlc|BASEPAGE/sandbox}}}
*'''t3''': title for template 1, completely overrides '''t1'''; set '''{{para|t3}}''' with no value for no title
*'''t4''': title for template 2, completely overrides '''t2'''; set '''{{para|t4}}''' with no value for no title
*'''box=y''': sets table width to 90% and adds dashes to the template cells
*'''title''': sets table title, defaults to ''Side by side comparison''; set '''{{para|title}}''' with no value for no title
