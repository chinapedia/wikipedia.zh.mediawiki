{{tlx|Active politician}} is intended for use on article '''talk pages only''', and adds pages to [[:Category:Active politicians]].

This template has been mostly deprecated in favour of {{tlx|WikiProject Biography}}. Since active politicians are by definition living, please use {{tlx|WikiProject Biography|living{{=}}yes|activepol{{=}}yes}} on the article's '''talk page'''.

If {{tlx|WikiProject Biography}} is nested within {{tlx|WikiProjectBannerShell}}, please use {{tlx|WikiProjectBannerShell|activepol{{=}}yes}} to display this template outside of the banner shell.

In extremely rare cases where {{tlx|WikiProject Biography}} and {{tlx|WikiProjectBannerShell}} are not used and might not be relevant, {{tlx|Active politician}} may be placed on a talk page directly.
