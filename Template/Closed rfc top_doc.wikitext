{{NoteTA|G1=MediaWiki}}{{Documentation subpage}}

This template is used to close a '''[[WP:RfC|Request for comment (RfC)]]''' on a talk page or a noticeboard.

When used on a talk page this template '''should only be used by uninvolved editors or administrators''' in conjunction with the [[Wikipedia:Talk page guidelines|talk page guidelines]] and relevant advice at [[Wikipedia:Refactoring|refactoring]]. It should not be used by involved parties to end a 'Request for discussion' over the objections of other editors.

=== 用法 ===
Place the {{tlx|closed rfc top}} template '''below''' the header containing the discussion, then place {{tlx|closed rfc bottom}} at the end of the discussion.

Again: '''Place it below the header. Do not include the header, it will break archiving bots!'''

It is important to use the direct transclusions {{tlx|closed rfc top}}/{{tlx|closed rfc bottom}} since if the redirects {{tlc|rfc top}}/{{tlc|rfc bottom}} are used, {{user|Legobot}} can interpret them as ''open'' RfCs, making {{diff|Wikipedia:Dispute resolution/2017 RfC|792268722|792264830|edits like these}} with {{oldid|Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Unsorted|792268739|this result}}.

=== 參數 ===
This template employs just a single parameter, used for describing the result of the discussion.

=== 舉例 ===

<pre>== RfC header ==
{{closed rfc top|1=The result of this discussion was that there appears to be a clear consensus in '''support''' of the proposal... [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]])}}
I suggest that we make a template to close completed RfC discussions. {{User|Example2}}
* I think it should be called ''Rfc top'' and ''Rfc bottom''! -{{User|Example3}}
{{closed rfc bottom}}</pre>

Would produce:
{{closed rfc top|The result of this discussion was that there appears to be a clear consensus in '''support''' of the proposal...  [[User:Example|Example]] ([[User talk:Example|talk]])}}
I suggest that we make a template to close completed RfC discussions. {{User|Example2}}
* I think it should be called ''Rfc top'' and ''Rfc bottom''! -{{User|Example3}}
{{closed rfc bottom}}
