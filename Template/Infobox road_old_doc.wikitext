__NOTOC__
This is the basic syntax you need to get a complete routebox on the article page, just place this before any other text and fill in the variables. Note that this is a complete list of every variable that can be used with Infobox road and that many are unnecessary in most cases. Variables that are empty can be omitted.

注意：英文維基百科的Template:Infobox road與本模板有一些差異，複製英文維基百科條目內的Infobox road內容至中文維基百科時可能需要修改以避免顯示錯誤。（'''注：{{tl|Infobox road2}}支援新版英文维基的要素，只需要在模板名称后面加上2即可使用。'''）

==參數說明==
===政區===
Three parameters exist for supplying the political entity that the road is located in. '''Only one may be used''' on a given article, preferably the most applicable of the three.

{| class="wikitable"
!Parameter
!What it takes
!Suggested usage
|-
|'''state'''
|The two-letter abbreviation of the state that the article route is located in
|U.S. roads
|-
|'''province'''
|The two-letter abbreviation of the province that the article route is located in
|Canadian roads
|-
|'''country'''
|Full name of the country that the article route is located in
|International roads
|}

===Shields and highway names===
If no political entity is specified, two parameters may be used to add a shield and the highway name. If a political entity is specified, there is no need to use these parameters except to overwrite the text generated by the political entity, "type" and "route". 
* '''marker_File:''' shield image to be displayed
* '''highway_name:''' road name to be displayed, usually the number of the road (example: "New York State Route 5").

===長度===
Multiple scenarios for lengths have been detailed below.

*使用'''length'''指明「總長度」；或
*使用'''length_mi'''和'''length_km'''指明「總長度」，可僅指明'''length_mi'''或'''length_km'''兩者之一的數值。
*'''length_ref''', if defined, appears after the first length. Use a citation for the length or {{tl|fact}} here. Be sure that the first length is the one for which you have a reference.
*'''length_notes''', if defined, appears as a note below the length. This can be used to show former length, or future length, etc.

===General content===
* '''name_notes:''' foot notes that will be displayed in small text underneath the highway name
* '''type:''' usually the two-letter state abbreviation for state roads; see the state WikiProject for more details
* '''route:''' This is the number of the route the article is about ''(used only with a political entity)''
* '''alternate_name:''' Use in situations where the '''entire route''' has another name (i.e. NY 590 is called the Sea Breeze Expressway for its entire length)
* '''maint:''' 負責維護本公路的單位
* '''section''' The section of code that defines this route. Only CA and WA use this, and the appropriate subpage (<nowiki>[[/CA law]]</nowiki> for example) must be set up.
* '''map:''' 用法是 map = Filename.jpg 之類。Image name of a map for the route, width should be 250px; see the [[WP:USRD/MTF|maps task force]] for maps; set '''map_custom'''=yes（此項在中文維基百科暫時無效） for a nonstandard map
*'''map2:''' 暫時代替map_custom，用法是 map2 = <nowiki>[[File:Filename.jpg|width]]</nowiki> 之類。
* '''established:''' This is the date the route was commissioned or assigned to its current alignment
* '''decommissioned:''' date the route was decommissioned
* '''direction_a:''' 如為美國道路，本處應為「南向」或「西向」以便與 [[WP:USRD|the U.S. Roads project]]保持一致；該計畫是將公路終點與交會處由西向東以及由南向北標註的。.
* '''starting_terminus:''' This is where the route begins and, for U.S. roads, is either at the '''southern''' terminus or '''western''' terminus.
* '''beltway_city:''' for beltways. This is the city that the beltway encircles
* '''junction:''' 列出主要交匯處。Each WikiProject has different standards for major junctions, so consult the relevant WikiProject for more details.
* '''direction_b:''' The opposite of ''direction_a''
* '''ending_terminus:''' where the route ends, in accordance with the guidelines set forth with starting_terminus
* '''counties:''' a list of 縣 that the route enters
* '''rural_municipalities:''' a list of [[rural municipalities]] that the route enters (specific to Manitoba and Saskatchewan)
* '''cities:''' a list of 城市 that the route enters
* '''system:''' the highway system that the article route is part of
* '''previous_type:''' This is the type of route that proceeds the current one in the system. For U.S. roads, the value for this is: '''Interstate''', '''US''', or '''(State)''' for Interstates, U.S. Routes and other state roads, respectively. Each state has a different parameter for state roads, so consult the WikiProject if in doubt.
* '''previous_route:''' The number of the route preceding this one
* '''next_type:''' Same as ''previous_type'' but for the route following this one
* '''next_route:''' The number of the route succeeding this one
* '''browse:''' use to add additional browse lines
* '''commons:''' use to add link to image gallery or category in commons, input should be gallery, category, or left blank
* '''customcommons:''' ''(use with '''commons''')'' use to specify a different gallery/category than the default that is linked
