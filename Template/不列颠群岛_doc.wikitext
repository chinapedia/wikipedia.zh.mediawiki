== 关于本模板 ==
This template was developed based on a discussion on the [[:en:Talk:Ireland|爱尔兰岛讨论页（英文維基）]] regarding objection there to the use of the term “[[不列颠群岛]]。”It is based on the original British Isles template developed by [[:en:User:Lofty|Lofty]] for use on articles relating to those islands.  By default it will insert the above template but has the possibility to set a different title, if necessary.

It is proposed that articles where the community would prefer the use of a different term first reach a consensus with regard to what other term(s) to use and then insert the template, adjusting the title as necessary.
== 如何使用本模板 ==
The template can be inserted on a page in one of two ways:

:1. Where there are no objections to the use of the term "British Isles" on a page, use the following:

::<code><nowiki>{{British Isles}}</nowiki></code>

:2. On articles where there are objections, first reach a consensus as to what other term(s) to use, then insert the template using the following code (replacing "Title Will Go Here" with the agreed title):

::<code><nowiki>{{British Isles|Title Will Go Here}}</nowiki></code>

=== Collapsible option ===
