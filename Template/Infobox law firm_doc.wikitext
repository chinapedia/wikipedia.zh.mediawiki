== 使用方法 ==
This template creates an [[Wikipedia:Infobox templates|infobox]] with the general information relevant to a [[law firm]].  It is roughly based on [[Template:Infobox Company]] but with law firm-related fields added (e.g., Number of Attorneys) and non-relevant fields eliminated (e.g., Products).  The infobox is not designed to contain all the information about a law firm, just the quick facts people usually want to look up.

Simply copy the following code and paste it at the top of the law firm entry, then fill in the blanks.  The ''firm_name'', ''num_offices'', ''num_attorneys'', and ''date_founded'' fields are obligatory.  Other entries left blank will be excluded from the displayed infobox.  To change the label from "Attorneys" to "Lawyers", use {{para|num_lawyers}} instead of {{para|num_attorneys}}.

<pre style="overflow:auto">
{{Infobox law firm
| name            =
| logo            =
| headquarters    =   <!-- city or, e.g., "Decentralized" -->
| num_offices     =
| num_attorneys   =
| num_lawyers     =   <!-- alternative to num_attorneys where "Lawyers" is more appropriate label -->
| num_employees   =   <!-- Total employees, including attorneys and staff -->
| practice_areas  =   <!-- MAJOR practice areas only; if they do everything "General Practice" -->
| key_people      =   <!-- chairmen and CEOs, not every famous lawyer in the firm -->
| revenue         =   <!-- amount (year) -->
| date_founded    =
| founder         =
| company_type    =   <!-- e.g., [[Limited liability partnership]] or [[Professional corporation]] -->
| slogan          =   <!-- not all firms have a slogan, so use as necessary  -->
| homepage        =
| dissolved       =   <!-- Date/Reason the company dissolved, e.g., merger or bankruptcy -->
}}

{{Infobox law firm
| name            = Sample Law Firm LLP
| logo            = [[Image:Tux.svg|100px]]
| headquarters    = [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]]
| num_offices     = 7
| num_attorneys   = 250+
| num_employees   = 550+
| practice_areas  = General practice, especially [[admiralty law]]
| key_people      = Billy Bob Partner (Chairman), Missy Smith (CEO)
| revenue         = {{profit}} $1.7 billion (1997)
| date_founded    = September 20, 1997
| founder         =
| company_type    = [[Limited liability partnership]]
| slogan          = Trust us, we're lawyers.
| homepage        = {{URL|samplelawfirmllc.com}}
| dissolved       = September 21, 1997 (merger with Other Law Firm LLC)
}}
Suppose we fill in the blanks like this:

<pre style="overflow:auto">
{{Infobox law firm
| name            = Sample Law Firm LLP
| logo            = [[Image:MyFirmLogo.jpg]]
| headquarters    = [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]]
| num_offices     = 7
| num_attorneys   = 250+
| num_employees   = 550+
| practice_areas  = General practice, especially [[admiralty law]]
| key_people      = Billy Bob Partner (Chairman), Missy Smith (CEO)
| revenue         = {{profit}} $1.7 billion (1997)
| date_founded    = September 20, 1997
| founder         =
| company_type    = [[Limited liability partnership]]
| slogan          = Trust us, we're lawyers.
| homepage        = {{URL|samplelawfirmllc.com}}
| dissolved       = September 21, 1997 (merger with Other Law Firm LLC)
}}
</pre>
The infobox will display like this on the right.  Notice the ''founder'' field is not displayed because we left it blank.
