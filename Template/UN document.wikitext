== 用法 ==
This Citation Template Structure is to be used for referring to UN documents from a Wikipedia article.  Detailed instructions are available on [[WP:CITE#HOW]].  But for a very brief introduction by way of an example, see the [[Water for Life Decade]] page and click on "edit" to see the source text.  In it you should find:

<pre>
 <ref name="UN_ARES58217_page2">{{UN document |docid=A-RES-58-217 |
    type=Resolution |body=General Assembly |session=58 | resolution_number=217|
    highlight=rect_190,300_813,350 |page=2 |accessdate=2007-11-13|
    date=[[23 December]] [[2003]]}}</ref>
</pre>

This is a generic representation of the document containing its official symbol, a page number, several parameters such as session number, type, and finally a highlighting to bring the readers attention to a specific part of the page.  The &lt;ref&gt; part causes it to appear as a footnote.

At the moment, for technical reasons, these links redirect through a webpage called [http://www.undemocracy.com www.undemocracy.com].  When the [http://www.un.org/documents/ United Nations webpage] becomes able to serve these essential [[Deep linking|deep links]] itself, then all wikipedia links can be moved to point to their proper place.

For an explanation of the format of the docid (known as the document symbol), see [[United Nations Document Codes]].

==参数==
Some of these values are mutually redundant, but alternatives are necessary.  

* docid: Document code  (eg A-58-PV.12)
* anchor: a pointer of form pg(pageno)-bk(blockno)-pa(paragraphno)
* body: General Assembly, Security Council
* type: Presidential Statement, Resolution, Verbatim Report
* session: session number (eg 58)
* meeting: meeting number (eg 12) (when type=Verbatim Report)
* resolutionnumber: (when type=Resolution)
* title: title of section or document being referenced
* page: pagenumber
* highlight: overlays a shaded rectangle over a page
* date: date of publication (the one on the document)
* meetingtime: time of meeting (sometimes several happen on one day)
* speakername: name of the speaker whose speech is being referred to
* speakernation: nation of the speaker whose speech is being referred to
* accessdate: date of access
* language: defaults to english

A page of codes is at http://www.library.yorku.ca/ccm/ScottReference/govpubs/guides/unindex.htm

For reasons best known to itself, the UN site does not support links on their website that go directly to these documents.  For now everything is factored through http://www.undemocracy.com

It's possible to decode it into english without reference to all the fields, but it will require http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/StringFunctions to be installed.  

You can get to the documents through http://documents.un.org/simple.asp or through http://www.undemocracy.org

==最优方法==
If you are viewing a document on the [http://www.undemocracy.com] site and you want to reference it in a wikipedia article, it is recommended that you find the line at the top of a holding page which says:
: wiki <nowiki>[</nowiki>''(some greyed text here)''<nowiki>]</nowiki>
and cut and paste from the text box.  This will give provide a citation to the document in a correct form for use by this template. 

If you are reading transcripts of a speech, then you can click on the 
: <nowiki>[</nowiki>link to here<nowiki>]</nowiki> 
box to the side of the text and be presented with a similar text box as above from which to cut and paste the fully formed template citation.

Every official United Nations document has a unique ID.  An outline of the coding system is at [[United Nations Document Codes]].
