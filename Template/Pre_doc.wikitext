This template implements a version of the functionality provided by the [[HTML]] {{tag|pre|o}} tag.

===Usage===
{{markup
|<nowiki>{{Pre|
This Pre-format

can look

like this.
}}</nowiki>
|{{Pre|
This Pre-format

can look

like this.
}}
}}
Main differences include:
* It wraps text that overflows the page.
* It allows mid-line-breaks (but not always consistently).

Main limitations include:
* If the text is a single long word, it won't be wrapped and will still break out to the right hand of the page.
* HTML and wikimarkup aren't disabled as in {{tag|pre}} and are rendered as usual (thus if a parameter contains any wikimarkup, enclose it in {{tag|nowiki}}); similarly, multiple spaces are treated as a single one.
* If there are only two lines, they will be stuck together, even if the source has a blank line between them.

As with {{tag|pre|o}} and {{tag|code|o}}, {{tl|pre}} displays text in the font specified as the monospace font in the user's browser options, or specified in the user's CSS pages.

===Example===
'''Markup'''

<pre>
{{Pre|
'''First line, markup working:''' and HTML comment <!--HIDDEN--> hidden.

'''Second line, long text wrapping:''' all work and no play make jack a dull boy all work and no play make jack a dull boy all work and no play make jack a dull boy all work and no play make jack a dull boy all work and no play make jack a dull boy.

'''Third line with raw | pipe is handled''', but the space before the pipe is lost. Up to raw 19 pipes are handled, else use <nowiki><nowiki></nowiki>{{!}}<nowiki></nowiki></nowiki> and {{!}} it's {{!}} OK.

'''Fourth      line,     multiple spaces collapsed into one''' as in HTML and wikitext.
'''Fifth line, stuck with the previous one''' if no blank line between them.

'''Last line''', is actually standalone with or without a blank line.
}}
</pre>
