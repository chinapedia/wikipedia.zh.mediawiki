This infobox is intended for use with "hub" or "set index" articles. These are articles that give an overview of the characters that have used a particular alias or codename, but where each of those characters have their own articles which use {{tl|Infobox comics character}}. The articles will also cover or reference a comics series named for one or more of those characters. Examples of this are [[Robin (character)]] and [[Flash (comics)]].

Articles which cover multiple characters and only some of those characters have their own articles should use {{tl|Infobox comics character}}, leaving out all information save the alter ego for the character(s) with a stand-alone article. Examples of these are [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Atom (comics)]].

For cases where the character set and the title have separate articles, use {{tl|Infobox comics set index}} and {{tl|Infobox comic book title}} respectively.

Articles for character sets without a related comics series should use {{tl|Infobox comics set index}}.

===Parameter notes===

====Common elements====
*Most of the parameters are designed only to show in the infobox if something is entered. They can be left in the template and empty if the item does not pertain to the article or if the information is not known at the time the template is added.
*The '''code_name''' field is an exception. If left empty the infobox will not generate a title. If the title for the infobox is the same as the title of the article, '''code_name''' can either be deleted or commented out. The later is preferable since the name of the article, or the preferred name of the infobox may change.
*For multiple items in one field, '''separate each with <nowiki><br /></nowiki>'''.
*::''Example:'' creators=Stan Lee<nowiki><br /></nowiki>Jack Kirby
*Placing images in the infobox uses two fields:
**'''image''' which is just the filname of the image. The template will add the markup to show the image.
**::''Example:'' image= example.jpg 
**'''imagesize''' which is the ''width'' the image will display at. The template will only accept a number here. If left empty or if a string (such as "225px") is entered, the image will default to 250px wide.
***If you find the image to be too tall, reduce the size below 250px.
***The parameter is capped at maximum width of 250. Entering values grater than this will result in the default setting being used. 
***The image will also cap at 450 in height.
*The '''caption''' will appear below the image. Keep it short, but indicate the original source published source of the image and the artist(s).
*::''Example:'' A comic book issue cover would be captioned as "''Wolverine'' vol 2, #17. Art by John Byrne."
*To keep in line with [[Wikipedia:Alternative text for images]], '''alt''' needs to be updated with the "text alternative" of the image. This is ''not'' the same as the caption. It should also be kept short, but needs to be descriptive of the image.
*For '''debut''', provide the first appearance of the character concept.
**'''debutmo''' and '''debutyr''' can be used in conjunction with '''debut'''. When this is done:
***'''debut''' is only the title, volume number, and issue number
***'''debutmo''' is the month, season or week specified in the issue's cover date. This field is optional so it can be left out if no "month" is part of the cover date.
***'''debutyr''' is the four digit year noted in the cover date. This will automatically link the year to the appropriate "Year in comics" list article. If this field is not present, only the information in '''debut''' will show up in the infobox.
*'''title''' is the title of the publication. If left empty the infobox will generate this based on the title of the article.
*An image of an initial, relevant cover can be placed into the info box using '''cvr_image'''. Complete the field with just the filname of the image, as with '''image'''. The template will add the markup to show the image. 
**For use in the infobox, this image will be constrained to a maximum width of 100px and a maximum height of 180px. Uploading a 300px version is recommended since the intent is to allow readers to click through for the more detailed version.
**Please also keep in mind the [[WP:NFC|non-free content]] guidelines and policies. If a similar image is being used as the ''main'' '''image''', do ''not'' add an image here as it would be [[WP:NFCC#3|redundant]].
*The '''cvr_caption''' will appear to the right of the image. Keep it short, but indicate the original source published source of the image and the artist(s) just as with '''caption'''. '''cvr_alt''' should also be provided.

====Specific elements====
*For '''creators''', as with '''debut''', list only the creators responsible for the initial character concept.
*'''characters''' should list the relevant characters in publication order. Convention is that the current character(s) using the '''code_name''' should be bolded. This is not a guideline or part of an existing Manual of style, just how the template is currently being applied.
*'''seealso''' is a catch all for relevant team articles, expanded character lists, and/or specifically related articles..
*'''schedule''' is how frequently the title was published.
*'''format''' indicates if the title was an ongoing series, limited series, or a one-shot. It is normally generated selecting one of the following logical fields. However, an entry like "type=(vol. 1) Limited series<nowiki><br></nowiki>(vol. 2) Ongoing" will over ride them. Note that the logical fields are not mutually exclusive as title with multiple volumes may have been published on each format.
**'''limited''' for limited series. See also [[#Categories|Categories]].
**'''ongoing''' for a series that was not intended to have a finite run or set final issue number.
**'''1shot''' for one issues runs. See also [[#Categories|Categories]].
*'''genre''' is generally not a field for keying, but a set of logical fields which relate to the major genre(s) that the title uses for its stories. The fields will also put the article into the proper categories under [[:Category:Comics genres]].<br>If more than one genre is appropriate, adding '''<samp>|multigenre = y</samp>''' will allow for the genres to all show in the infobox, but the alphabetically first genre will need to use '''<samp>first</samp>''' to add it and not have "''', '''" precede the text.<br>The currently supported genres are listed [[#Genre list|here]].
*'''date''' is the period that the title was in publication. Normal convention is to list the [[cover date]]s, with the months not abbreviated. The year(s) can also be entered as <nowiki>[[YEAR in comics|YEAR]]</nowiki>.
**'''date''' should be used when additional information, such as references, or complicated date listings are needed. In other cases, a set of fields can be used to generate the date information. These fields are:
***'''1stishhead''' - Either the volume number or subtitle used to distinguish multiple volumes. This field is only needed if there are 2 or more volumes.
***'''1stishyr''' - The year, by the cover date, of the first issue.
***'''1stishmo''' - The month, season or week specified in the first issue's cover date. This field is optional so it can be left out if no "month" is part of the cover date.
***'''endishyr''' - The year, by the cover date, of the last issue.
***'''endishmo''' - The month, season or week specified in the last issue's cover date. This field is optional so it can be left out if no "month" is part of the cover date.
****If '''endishyr''' and '''endishmo''' are omitted, the template will assume that the volume is still being published and substiutute "Present" for a final cover date.
****Two or more volumes can be indicated by using '''1stishhead#''', '''1stishyr#''', '''1stishmo#''', '''endishyr#''', and '''endishmo#'''. Replace "#" with a number (currently the template is set up for 6 additional volumes) and enter the appropriate information.
*'''issues''' is the number of issues the title ran. This can be annotated with any odd numbering sequences. '''1shot''' will automatically enter a "1" here.
*Creators and primary characters/teams that are, or have been, involved with title can be listed with the following fields. These fields should be minimal, please keep this in mind when dealing with long running titles.
**'''main_char_team'''
**'''writers'''
**'''artists'''
***'''''NOTE:''''' '''artist''' should be used when listing creators who contributed in more than one capacity as a penciller, inker, and/or colorist. This would also include those who work in painted or photographic art.
**'''pencillers'''
**'''inkers'''
**'''letterers'''
**'''colorists'''
**'''editors'''
*'''creative_team_month''' and '''creative_team_year''' create and "as of" notation in the "Creative team" header. Care should be taken with using these fields in light of [[WP:DATED]].
*'''creators_series''' lists those that created the series. It should not include creators of previously existing characters that were brought into the title. If this field would be the same as '''creators''', leave this field blank.
*'''nonUS''' is a logical notation for items that were published using British instead of American spellings. At present this only affects the "Colorist/Colourist" field. 
*'''CEheader''' will change the page that '''Collected editions''' directs to. Defaults to <nowiki>#Collected editions</nowiki>. See [[The New 52]] as an example of how this is used.
*'''TPB''' and '''ISBN''' are used to list notable collected editions. Up to 10 can be accommodated (ISBN1, ISBN2, ... ISBN10). "Notable" in this case would be the first printing of one of the first few collections or a collection with citable critical acclaim (industry award nominee or winner for example).

====Categories====
This infobox has been designed to automatically place articles its added to into appropriate categories under [[:Category:Comics characters]] and [[:Category:Comics publications]]. To do this the following parameters are used. Please not that this infobox is structured to put the primary emphasis on the character.
*'''cat''' is used for cases where the primary category is a specific type of character. Due to the limitations of the template, the entry for this parameter cannot be capitalized.
**For ease of use "superhero" and "supervillain" should be shortened to just "super".
*'''subcat''' is used to specify a particular subcategory of [[:Category:Comics characters]] and [[:Category:Comics publications]]. This can be a publisher, imprint, or nation of original publication. Please review the noted categories for which subcategories exist.<br>This will interact with '''cat''' and the template has been set up to limit options to currently existing categories.
**If the initial publisher would be the first subcategory for the title but not for the character, use '''subcat''' for the character and '''subcat_pub''' for the series.
*'''altcat''' is used for cases where "character", a character type, or "titles" is not the ending of the appropriate category.
**'''''Note:''''' '''subcat''' and '''altcat''' are mutually exclusive. If both are left empty, the article will be placed into [[:Category:Comics characters]] and [[:Category:Comics publications]] by default.
*'''hero''' and '''villain''' are logical functions that work with "cat= super". Each will add the article to the publisher specific "superhero" and "supervillain" categories. 
*'''sortkey''' is the title by which the article will be sorted in the categories placed by the template. This sorting will default to <nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}</nowiki> and will override <nowiki>{{DEFAULTSORT}}</nowiki> listings in the article. Due to markup limitations, this parameter will not recognize a leading space.
**Due to different sorting conventions for characters and publications, '''sort_title''' should also be entered even if it is identical to '''sortkey'''.
*Additional categories similar to the one set by either '''subcat''' or '''altcat''' can be added with '''addcharcat#''' for character derived categories and '''addpubcat#''' for publication related categories. Replace "#" with a number (currently the template is set up for 6 additional categories of each type) and list the full category title. Please list the categories in publication order.
*If '''debutyr''' is present, the article will also be added to the appropriate "'Year' comics characters debuts" category. This category will list after the "Comics characters" categories.
*Additional debut categories can be added using '''debutyr#''' . Replace "#" with a number (currently the template is set up for 6 additional categories) and enter the appropriate year. Please keep the following in mind:
**A year should only be added once and the years should be in chronological order.
**Only add a year for a character that first appeared using a particular the name featured in the article. Do not add it for character that first adopt the name after they first appear.
**::''Example:'' For [[Ant-Man]] a debut category can be added for "Eric O'Grady", a character that was created and initially used as "Ant-Man", but one is not added for "Scott Lang", a character which did not first appear as "Ant-Man".
**'''debutyr1''' can be used to allow for an initial category if a non-standard '''debut''' is needed.
*Two of the logical fields for format will add the article to categories in addition to that set by '''subcat''' or '''altcat'''.
**'''limited''' This will also automatically sort the article into [[:Category:Comic book limited series]]. This will interact with '''subcat''' to a degree.
***In cases where there is an ongoing and a limited series where the subcategories are different, the use '''limsub''' for the subcategory for the limited series.
***::''Example:'' If DC Comics produced an onging that was cancelled prior to 1980, and then produced a limited series of the same title, but published under the Vertigo imprint, the following would be entered:<br><samp>|limited = y<br>|ongoing = y<br>|subcat  = DC Comics<br>|limsub  = Vertigo</samp>
**'''1shot''' This will also automatically sort the article into [[:Category:One-shot comic titles]]
*'''1stishyr''' will add the article to the appropriate "'Year' comics debuts" category. This category will list after the "Comics publications" categories.
*Additional debut categories can be added using '''1stishyr#''' . Replace "#" with a number (currently the template is set up for 6 additional categories) and enter the appropriate year. Please keep the following in mind:
**A year should only be added once and the years should be in chronological order.
**Only add a year based on the cover date of the first issue of the title.
*The '''genre''' logical fields will also add the appropriate categories.
