== Usage ==
The {{tl|" '}} template (or {{tl|Double single}} in long form) is for use at the beginning of a 'single-quoted' quotation that also begins a "double-quoted" quotation (or a double-quoted passage that begins with an apostrophe). Its purpose is to slightly space the double and single quotation marks apart for legibility, without actually inserting a space character. It does this with [[层叠样式表]], and does so because the insertion of an extranous space character of any kind would be a violation of the [[语义网]] of the article or other page in which it appeared.

;Example (with highlighting added for clarity):

*Using the template:

:<code>Gonzales added, <span style="color:fuchsia;"><strong><nowiki>{{" '}}</nowiki></strong></span>Interesting times' is quite a euphemism for this chaos."</code>

:Gonzales added, {{" '}}Interesting times' is quite a euphemism for this chaos."

*For comparison, here is the completely unspaced version:

:<code>Gonzales added, <span style="color:fuchsia;"><strong>"'</strong></span>Interesting times' is quite a euphemism for this chaos."</code>

:Gonzales added, "'Interesting times' is quite a euphemism for this chaos."

*And here is the version with a semantically incorrect non-breaking space character:

:<code>Gonzales added, <span style="color:fuchsia;"><strong>"&amp;nbsp;'</strong></span>Interesting times' is quite a euphemism for this chaos."</code>

:Gonzales added, "&nbsp;'Interesting times' is quite a euphemism for this chaos."

:When rendered, the non-breaking-spaced version looks similar to or the same as the template version, but improperly mixes content and presentation.

The equivalent template when used inside a template parameter that automatically provides double quotes (e.g. {{para|title}} in {{tl|cite web}}) is {{tl|-'}} ({{tsl|en|Template:Space single||Template:Space single}}).  See also {{tl|' "}} and {{tl|'-}} for the right-hand side versions (manual and parameter, respectively).
