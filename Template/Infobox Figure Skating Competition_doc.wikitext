==Usage==
This is an infobox for an article on a specific figure skating competition. The only required field is ''title''. If no fields are defined from a section, that section header will not be displayed.

Use the reigning fields for a future competition for which there are reigning champions. Use the defending fields for a future competition for which there are defending champions. Use the champions fields for a competition that has already crowned champions.
