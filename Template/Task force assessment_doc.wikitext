This template is used to display article assessment statistics tables.  It can be used to show either WikiProject or task force statistics.  The template takes two parameters: the first is the name of the WikiProject and the second is the name of the task force.

=== Usage ===
To display article statistics for WikiProject ''ProjectName'':
 {{tlc|Task force assessment|''ProjectName''}}
To display article statistics for WikiProject ''ProjectName''/''TaskForceName'' task force:
 {{tlc|Task force assessment|''ProjectName''|''TaskForceName''}}
For task forces that use non-standard prefixes for category naming:
 {{tlc|Task force assessment|''ProjectName''|''TaskForceName''|''CategoryName''}}
