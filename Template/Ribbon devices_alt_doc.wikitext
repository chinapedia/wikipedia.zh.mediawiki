This is a subsidiary template to {{tl|ribbon devices}}. This template takes a single argument, which is the name of a ribbon, and produces [[alt attribute|alt text]] for that ribbon. Please see ''[[Wikipedia:Alternative text for images]]'' for more about alt text.

To describe the ribbon "<code>File:<var>ID</var>.svg</code>", add a line:

: <code>|<var>ID</var>=<var>Description of the ribbon</var></code>

to the template. U.S. military ribbons are one and three-eighths inches wide, and by convention here they are divided into 44 units of width, each one thirty-second of an inch.

For example, for the ribbon whose ID is "Valorous Unit Award ribbon", the image is [[:File:Valorous Unit Award ribbon.svg]], which looks like this:

[[File:Valorous Unit Award ribbon.svg|thumb|center|alt=Width-44 Old Glory red ribbon surrounded by gold frame. The ribbon has a central width-3 Old Glory red stripe flanked by pairs of stripes that are respectively width-3 white, width-3 ultramarine blue, width one-half white and width-2 ultramarine blue.|Valorous Unit Award ribbon]]

The corresponding entry in this template's source code is:

<pre style="overflow:auto">
|Valorous Unit Award ribbon= Width-44 Old Glory red ribbon surrounded by gold frame. The ribbon has a central width-3 Old Glory red stripe flanked by pairs of stripes that are respectively width-3 white, width-3 ultramarine blue, width one-half white and width-2 ultramarine blue.
</pre>

Examples in this template should be sorted alphabetically. Each alt text entry should appear on a single line; it should not be broken into multiple lines.

For precise colors and measurements suitable for transcription into alt text, please see the official descriptions of U.S. ribbons.<ref>{{vcite web |url=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Awards/Ribbons/OrderofPrecedence.htm |title=United States armed forces awards, decorations, campaign & service medals |home=U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry |homeurl=http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/tioh.htm |location=Ft Belvoir, VA |homedate=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2010-01-24 }}</ref>
