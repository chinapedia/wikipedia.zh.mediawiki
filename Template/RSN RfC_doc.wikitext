This template produces a small [[Template:Ombox|messagebox]] that displays the status of a [[WP:RFC|request for comment]] (RfC) on the [[WP:RSN|reliable sources noticeboard]]. The template prevents the RfC from being [[H:ARC|automatically archived]] before it elapses, and shows one of three messages depending on the circumstances:

# If the RfC is active, the template tells the reader when the RfC will elapse.
# If the RfC has elapsed and is located on the reliable sources noticeboard, the template tells the reader that the RfC will be automatically archived after five days with no comments.
# If the RfC has elapsed and is archived, the template tells the reader that the RfC can be [[WP:CLOSE|closed]].

Remove this template while closing the RfC or when announcing that the RfC is no longer accepting comments.

== Usage ==

Place this template directly above the {{tlx|rfc}} template.

If you are starting a new RfC, use {{tlc|subst:RSN RfC}}. Otherwise, insert the timestamp of the RfC statement as the first parameter, as in {{tlc|subst:RSN RfC|00:00, 1 January 2020 (UTC)}}. This template should always be [[WP:SUBST|substituted]].

The template accepts two optional unnamed parameters:
# The timestamp of the RfC statement
#* This parameter defaults to the current time if left empty.
# The minimum duration of the RfC, in days
#* This parameter defaults to {{code|7}} if left empty.
#* The minimum duration of seven days was set in {{slink|Wikipedia:Reliable sources/Noticeboard/Archive 293#RfC: Deprecation and blacklisting process}} ([[WP:RSNRFC]]).
#* Only [[non-negative integers]] are accepted.
