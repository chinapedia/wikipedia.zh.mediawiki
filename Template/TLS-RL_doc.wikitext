The d-span and o-span parameters can be used to apply the same decay date and outcome to different payloads on the same rocket. If a number is entered, then that field will be applied to that many consecutive payloads (including the one for which it is specified). If it is set to "inherit" then it will inherit from the cell above. If it is not set to "inherit" but a span is specified above, then it will cause a syntax error. The d-span parameter should only be used where the payloads will be attached during re-entry/landing, and o-span should only be used in the event of a total launch failure{{#ifeq:{{{brief|no}}}|no|.
