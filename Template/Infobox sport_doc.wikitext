===Parameters===

All parameters are optional.

; <code>name</code>: The name of the sport; this is usually the same as the name of the article, unless it has been disambiguated. E.g., <code>Association football</code>. Capitalization should match article title. If this attribute is omitted, the name will be inferred from the page title.
; <code>image</code>: the filename of an image to use (without "File:" or "File:" prefix), e.g. <code>football iu 1996.jpg</code>
; <code>imagesize</code>: the width in pixels for the image, e.g. <code>275px</code> Larger that 300 is not recommended. If this attribute is omitted, the image will default to 125px width.
; <code>caption</code>: A caption for the image, e.g. <code>An attacking player (No 10) attempts to kick the ball past the goalkeeper to score a goal.</code>
; <code>union</code>: The highest officiating body associated with the sport, e.g. [[FIFA]] for association football.
; <code>nickname</code>: One or more (comma-separated) nicknames of the sport. Non-English names should ''not'' be put here, unless they are frequent in English. E.g., <code><nowiki>Football, soccer, futbol<!-- Commonly used in the USA to differentiate from American football (known as football) -->, footy/footie, "the beautiful game"</nowiki></code>. Capitalize only the first nickname (unless one or more other ones are proper names).
; <code>first</code>: Year (or century, if year unknown) and location the game was first played in some recognizable form. For very specific modern games (e.g. [[snooker plus]]), use as specific a date as possible, for that particular game not any ancestral forms.  For a broader sense of "sport", more generality may be used (e.g. for [[cue sports]]). Do not link these dates. Examples: <code>1942, <nowiki>[[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]</nowiki></code> or <code>1863, England, with roots in prehistory</code> or <code>15th century Europe</code>. For location, it is unnecessary to link countries or general regions unless obscure.
; <code>registered</code>:  How many players have registered to participate with this sport's affiliated governing bodies?
; <code>clubs</code>:  How many clubs have registered with this sport's affiliated governing bodies?
; <code>contact</code>: Is this a contact sport? Typical values are <code>No</code> or <code>Yes</code>, though something more specific could be put here (e.g. <code>With feet only</code>, etc.)
; <code>team</code>: Size of teams. Various values are possible, such as: <code>No teams, single competitors</code>, or <code>11 per side</code>, <code>single competitors, doubles, or teams of up to 5</code>, etc.
; <code>mgender</code>: Is this a mixed-gender sport? Various answers can be used here: <code>No</code>, <code>Yes</code>, <code>Yes, but usually in separate leagues/divisions</code>, etc.
; <code>category</code>: Whether it is an indoor or outdoor game, and any other categorizations that may be useful. Examples: <code>Outdoor or indoor, field</code>, or <code>Indoor, rink</code>, or <code>Indoor, table</code>, or <code>Indoor or outdoor, aquatic</code>. Links can be used.  More specific categorization can be used: <code>Outdoor, aquatic, <nowiki>[[motor sport]]</nowiki></code>
; <code>equipment</code>: Links to separate articles on key items of equipment used in the game, if any such articles exist. E.g., <code><nowiki>[[Billiard ball]]s, [[billiard table]], [[cue stick]]</nowiki></code>, or <code><nowiki>[[Football (ball)|Football]]</nowiki></code>.
; <code>venue</code>: Link to separate article on type(s) of venue that the game is played in, if any such articles exist.  E.g., <code><nowiki>[[足球场|Football pitch]]</nowiki></code>, or <code><nowiki>[[Billiard hall]] or home [[billiard room]]</nowiki></code>.
; <code>olympic</code>: <code>No</code> or year of acceptance into the [[奥运会]] and link to appropriate article (e.g. <code><nowiki>[[1904年夏季奥林匹克运动会|1904]]</nowiki></code>, if any. Other values can be used, e.g. <code>[[1900年夏季奥林匹克运动会|1904]]; removed from program in [[2004年夏季奥林匹克运动会|1904]]</code>, or <code><nowiki>Proposed for [[2010年冬季奥林匹克运动会|2010]]</nowiki></code>.  Omit this field entirely when non-relevant (e.g. medieval games that are now exinct).
; <code>obsolete</code>: Is this game obsolete? Any value, such as <code>y</code> or <code>yes</code> will cause this field to display as "Yes" ''Leave this field empty or omit it entirely if not obsolete; do not use <code>no</code> (that will not work).'' A game is obsolete if it has zero or near-zero living players.  Just because a folk game has been "replaced" by a standardized game with a national governing body does not necessarily mean that it is obsolete (cf. [[stickball]], which evolved into [[棒球]] but is still played).
