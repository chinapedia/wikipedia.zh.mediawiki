<!----
The banks in this template are derived from the "Top 50 bank holding companies" list published by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, an interagency body of the United States government.  Please DO NOT add banks to this list if they do not appear on the FFIEC's "Top 50" list!

Linking convention: The FFIEC list gives the name of the top American bank holding company regardless of if it is itself owned by a foreign bank.  As the intention of this template is to show the "fifty largest American banks and bank holding companies," the highest level American company has been included.

Naming convention: To reduce visual clutter, many common trailing words (bank, bancshares, capital, corporation, financial, group, etc.) have been edited out of the template when the holding company and the bank have very similar names (e.g. Sky Financial Group becomes Sky, Key Bank becomes Key, Associated Banc-Corp becomes Associated, etc.).  However when the holding company and the bank have dissimilar names, only common business suffixes (company, corporation, etc.) were edited out (e.g. BOK Financial Corporation operates several banks [Bank of Oklahoma, Bank of Texas, Bank of Albuquerque, etc.] with none of them named BOK, so it is listed in the template as BOK Financial).  Exceptions to these two naming conventions were made when necessary for disambiguation (e.g. many banks are named Citizens, so Citizens Financial Group retained its full name; Commerce Bancshares and the former Commerce Bancorp retained their full names; and City National Bank of California is identified as the one in California (as there are multiple banks with this name)).
