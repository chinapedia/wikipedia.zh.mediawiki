== Usage ==

: {{Tlx|Ambiguous|date{{=}}{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTYEAR}}}}

This is an inline maintenance template for ambiguous statements that need attention in Wikipedia articles.  It is not to be used in Wikipedia policy pages (was previously deleted when a similarly named template was used for that purpose).  

Use of this template will put the article in the [[:Category:Wikipedia articles needing clarification|Category:Wikipedia articles needing clarification]] category, or a monthly subcategory thereof.
