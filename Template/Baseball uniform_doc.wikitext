==Syntax==
[[:Template:Baseball uniform]] is a template for a basic baseball uniform. It is based on ideas from [[Template:Football kit]]. Home and away uniforms, using this template, are used by [[Template:Infobox baseball team]], which may be a useful [[:Category:Infobox templates|infobox]] for non-major league teams.

<div style="float:right; width: 100px;">
{{Baseball uniform
 | cap           = 0000AA
 | pattern_cap   = _redbill
 | leftarm       = 9999FF
 | pattern_la    = 
 | body          = 0000AA
 | pattern_b     = _baseball_whitepiping
 | rightarm      = 9999FF
 | pattern_ra    = 
 | pants         = 0000AA
 | pattern_pants = _pinstripesonwhite
 | socks         = AA0000
 | title         = Something
}}
</div>
<pre>
{{Baseball uniform
 | cap           = 0000AA
 | pattern_cap   = _redbill
 | leftarm       = 9999FF
 | pattern_la    = 
 | body          = 0000AA
 | pattern_b     = _baseball_whitepiping
 | rightarm      = 9999FF
 | pattern_ra    =

As with Template:Football_kit, patterns are suffixes to the basic images that make up the template. Thus, in the example above, ''_thinstripesonwhite'' gets the body pattern (i.e., ''pattern_b'') with pinstripes on a white field. There are many examples of shirts and sleeves at the talk page for the football kit template (i.e., [[Template talk:Football kit]]. However, for baseball we may need special patterns for caps and pants.

==Baseball-specific patterns==
For new patterns, please use the same dimensions as for the basic patterns. When you upload your pattern image (with the correct name, of course), please add it to the appropriate list below. If it is a shirt, please add it to the talk page for the football kit, as well.

When you create patterns, please ''use transparency!'' This allows other users of the template to use the images you've created.

===Caps===
The base image is called 'File:Kit_baseball_cap.png'. You might need to create a new pattern if the bill of the cap is different from the crown, etc.

{{Baseball uniform/pattern|baseball_cap}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|baseball_cap|_redbill}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|baseball_cap|_blackcrown}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|baseball_cap|_yellowbill}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|baseball_cap|_greenbill}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|baseball_cap|_greencrown}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|baseball_cap|_redcrown}}
{{brClear}}

===Pants===
I called the base image 'File:Kit_trousers.png' because I was gunshy about the word "pants."

{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers|_beltongrey}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers|_beltonwhite}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers|_greenbelt}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers|_pinstripesongrey}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers|_pinstripesonwhite}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers|_pinstripesonwhite_redbelt}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers|_redbelt}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|trousers|_redbelt_redsidestripe}}
{{brClear}}

===Baseball Shirts===
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball whitebuttons}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball_blackpiping}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball_doublegreenpiping}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball_doublepipingongrey}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball_doublepipingonwhite}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball_greypiping}}

{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball_unknown}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball_whitepiping}}
{{Baseball uniform/pattern|body|_baseball_classicalblackpiping}}
{{brClear}}

==Generic patterns==
The patterns below were created for use with the {{Tl|Football kit}} template and may not be appropriate for most baseball uniforms. However, they should give many ideas for what you can do with this framework.
