==註釋==

===適用性===
This template can be used to provide structured details of an infrastructure project that is planned on under construction. This is distinct from the completed project which might have its own infobox. For example a motorway may have been built and expanded in a number of separate projects - the mototway would have an infobox and the construction projects may also have separate infoboxes.

===字段用法===
所有字段的用法參見[[Template_talk:Infobox future infrastructure project|討論]]，然而這裡有一些字段的計劃用詞。
*status : 願望/計劃/核準/撤回/擱置/建設中/完工
*type : 道路/鐵路/機場/建築物 等
