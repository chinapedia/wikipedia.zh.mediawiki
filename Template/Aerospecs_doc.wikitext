<!-- for the documentation don't subst the result -->

This template was designed so that the data supported by it should be largely self-explanatory. A detailed description of the various fields, with examples, follows:

* '''ref''' – allows for the data in this section to be specifically sourced if necessary or desired

* '''met or eng?''' – switches the template from displaying English units first (by entering '''eng''') or SI units first (by entering '''met'''). There is a long-standing convention within WikiProject:Aircraft that specifications for US and UK aircraft should be given as English units first, and all others as SI units first.
:[[File:Nuvola apps important.svg|left|16px]] you ''must'' include either '''eng''' or '''met'''  in this field or the template won't display at all!

* '''genhide''' allows the "General characteristics" heading to be manually turned off in the rare case that none of the data in this section is available. Enter <code>|genhide=Y</code> to do this. If using this parameter, please leave a hidden note so that other editors will know to remove this line to turn the heading back on again. 
::Example 
:::<nowiki>|genhide=Y <!-- please remove this line if data on general characteristics becomes available --></nowiki>

* '''crew''' – the number of people typically required to operate the aircraft, and their positions (if known). For commercial aircraft, this may include cabin crew. If specific positions are not known, this field might just contain a number. If the number is "One", however, it's safe to assume that this person's job might be "pilot"! Drones and UAVs should have "None" in this field.

::Examples
:::Four
:::One pilot
:::None
:::Three: Pilot, co-pilot, and navigator/radio operator
:::Two: Pilot and tail-gunner
:::Five: Two pilots, flight engineer, two cabin crew


* '''capacity''' – the passenger and/or cargo carrying capacity of the aircraft. Typically, this may include some alternatives when a transport aircraft is typically configurable for a variety of cargo types. In these cases, the alternatives should be separated by ''or'' (in italics)

:: Examples
::: 32 passengers
::: 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) of cargo
::: 320 US gal (1,200 L) of chemicals
::: Eight 463L cargo pallets
::: Six passengers ''or'' two litters with attendants

* '''length''' – the overall length of the airframe. For rotary-wing aircraft, this is the fuselage length, not counting areas swept by turning rotors.

* '''span''' – the overall wingspan for fixed-wing aircraft. This does not count areas swept by turning propellers, but does include the width of tip-tanks, finlets, and non-removable wingtip weapons stations. For variable-geometry aircraft, this is the unswept span. For unequal-span biplanes, triplanes, and multiplanes, this is the greatest span.

* '''swept''' – the swept  wingspan variable-geometry fixed-wing aircraft

* '''rot number''' – the number of main (lifting) rotors on a rotary-wing aircraft. This will only be displayed if the number is greater than 1

* '''rot dia''' – the diameter of the main (lifting) rotor(s) on a rotary-wing aircraft

* '''dia''' – the diameter of an aircraft where this is the best way to describe it. This will most often be used for describing airships and balloons, but will also make sense for disc-shaped (Example: [[VZ-1 Pawnee]], [[Avro Avrocar]]) or cylindrical (Example: [[SNECMA Coléoptère]]) heavier-than-air aircraft. Please do not use this to express a fuselage diameter of a conventional heavier-than-air aircraft – mention that in the article text if it's relevant.

* '''width''' – the width of an aircraft in the few very rare cases where this is the best way to describe it (example: [[Rolls-Royce Thrust Measuring Rig]], [[LLRV]])

* '''height''' – the overall height of an aircraft, landing gear extended

* '''wing area''' – the area of the mainplanes of a fixed-wing aircraft. This excludes the area of horizontal stabiliser or canards. For biplanes, triplanes, and multiplanes, this is the sum of all mainplane areas. For variable-geometry aircraft, this is the unswept area 

* '''swept area''' – for variable-geometry aircraft where the mainplane area differs depending on whether the wings are swept or not.

* '''rot area''' – the area of the main (lifting) rotor(s) of a rotary-wing aircraft. For multi-rotor aircraft, this is the sum of all rotor areas.

* '''volume''' – the envelope volume of a lighter-than-air or hybrid aircraft. Please do not use this to express the volume of a cargo space – put that under "capacity" if it's relevant.

* '''aspect ratio''' – the ratio of the length of a wing to its chord. While measurable in any fixed-wing aircraft, please only provide this specification when describing sailplanes.

* '''empty weight''' – the unloaded, unfuelled, unoccupied weight of the aircraft. In most cases, this will be the Basic Aircraft Empty Weight. For lighter-than-air or hybrid aircraft, this will be the structural weight of the aircraft. 

* '''gross weight''' – the fully-loaded weight of the aircraft. In most cases, this will be the Maximum Take Off Weight.

* '''lift''' – the static lift of a lighter-than-air or hybrid aircraft. Please do not use this to describe dynamic lift.

* '''Engines''' – at present, the template allows for up to two different types of engines on an aircraft. Typically, this will be used for mixed-power aircraft with piston-engines and jets, or jets and rockets, but occasionally an aircraft will be fitted with more than one type of piston engine. Please do not use this for APUs, or for alternative engine fits.

* '''eng number''' – the number of this type of engine, expressed with a digit

* '''eng type''' – the manufacturer and model of the engine. Please make sure to wiki this to the engine article. Please do not simply link to the engine manufacturer to avoid a redlink here. Redlinks are good! They help us grow! 

* '''eng kw''' and '''eng hp''' – the rated power of a propeller engine (whether piston or turbine-driven)

* '''eng kn''' and '''eng lbf''' – the rated dry thrust of a jet or rocket engine

* '''eng kn-ab''' and '''eng lbf-ab''' – the afterburning thrust of a jet engine so equipped.

* '''perfhide''' allows the "Performance" heading to be manually turned off in the rare case that none of the data in this section is available. Enter <code>|perfhide=Y</code> to do this. If using this parameter, please leave a hidden note so that other editors will know to remove this line to turn the heading back on again. 
::Example 
:::<nowiki>|perfhide=Y <!-- please remove this line if performance data becomes available --></nowiki>

* '''max speed''' – the maximum speed of the aircraft

* '''cruise speed''' – the maximum cruising speed of the aircraft (usually only specified where the maximum speed is unknown)

* '''range''' – the maximum unrefuelled range of the aircraft

* '''endurance''' – the maximum flight endurance of the aircraft, where the range is unknown (this is particularly common in specifications of early aircraft).

* '''ceiling''' – the service ceiling of the aircraft

* '''glide ratio''' – the maximum glide ratio of an aircraft. Please only include this specification when describing gliders and sailplanes.

* '''climb rate''' – the maximum rate of climb for a powered aircraft

* '''sink rate''' – the minimum rate of sink for an aircraft. Please only include this specification when describing gliders and sailplanes.

* '''armament''' – the armament of a military aircraft. Six fields have been provided. Please make sure to wiki weapons to their articles – don't simply link to the manufacturer to avoid a redlink here. Redlinks are good! They help us grow! Typically, this may include some alternatives when an aircraft can carry a variety of weapons. In these cases, the alternatives should be separated by ''or'' (in italics)

::Examples: 
:::2 × rearward-firing .303 [[Vickers machine gun]]s in flexible mount for observer
:::1 × fixed, forward-firing 20 mm [[M61 Vulcan]] cannon
:::2,000 lb (909 kg) of bombs ''or'' 1 × [[Mark 48 torpedo]]
:::1,500 kg (3,300 lb) of disposable stores on two underwing and one underfuselage pylons.
:::2 × [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] missiles on wingtip stations
:::4 × [[SC 250]] bombs carried in internal bay
