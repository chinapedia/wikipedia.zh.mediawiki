<!-- 在本行下編輯模板說明 -->

== 概要 ==
本模板用于国际[[足球]]锦标赛统计数据条目，如[[2014年世界杯足球赛统计数据]]。
== 參數及使用方法 ==
=== 基本用法 ===
<pre style="overflow:auto; word-wrap: break-word;">
<nowiki>{{</nowiki>International football competition statistics
| type = <!-- scoring / wins-losses / discipline -->
| line-breaks = <!-- enable line breaks between statistics instead of commas (yes/no) -->
| updated = <!-- the date and/or time at which the statistics were last updated-->
}}
</pre>

本模板包含三对参数：得分、赢输球和停赛。因此，不能同时使用两种类型（例如当“停赛”正在进行时，得分参数不能使用）。而{{param|line-breaks}}和{{param|updated}}是通用的，不受限制。
=== “得分”模板用法 ===
除“类型”和“比赛”外，所有参数都可以选择。
