<!--{{Extrasolar planet counts}} begin--><includeonly><!--

## This template centralizes the counts of verified extrasolar planets, and systems.  These are used in several articles, and sometimes
## more than once.  Placing them here allows them all to be updated at once, and avoids the problem of only one count in an article
## getting updated. 

## param 1 specifies the parameter to be inserted:
##    asof - the date as of which the data is valid
##       param 2 on asof specifies the date format, as used in template:date
##    planet_count - the number of extrasolar planets
##    system_count - the number of systems with extrasolar planets
##    multiplanetsystem_count - the number of systems with more than one extrasolar planet

## These numbers are sourced from the Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog, http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php
## In the switch statement below, asof and planet_count should be copied directly from the first few lines ("update"
## and "all candidates detected").  system_count and multiplanetsystem_count must be totaled manually from the four
## categories listed:
##    Candidates detected by radial velocity or astrometry
##    Candidates detected by microlensing
##    Candidates detected by imaging
##    Candidates detected by timing
## Note: do not add the "transiting planet" subcategory numbers - these numbers are already included in the "Candidates
## detected by radial velocity or astrometry" category.
