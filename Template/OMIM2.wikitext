==Usage==
This template creates a very concise reference citation to a specific numbered page at the Online [[Mendelian Inheritance in Man]] database.

'''<nowiki>{{OMIM2|#####}}</nowiki>''', where "#####" is the OMIM page number.

Results: {{OMIM2|12345}}

This template is good to use when there is a long series of OMIM citations in a row and one wishes to be as concise as possible with them.  Generally, it should be immediately preceded by use of the {{tl|OMIM}} template, or {{tl|OMIM3}} (or its plainlinks variant {{tl|OMIM5}} if {{tl|OMIM}} was already used earlier in the article/section; without preceding {{tl|OMIM2}} with one or the other, it will be unclear to the reader what the citation is citing.   {{tl|OMIM2}} is also used (and was created) for [[Template:Infobox Disease]].  There is a plainlinks version of {{tl|OMIM2}}, at {{tl|OMIM4}}, that does not show the external link icon, for use infoboxes where the context already makes it clear that the links are external.
