This template is intended to be used on feedback pages and talk pages for software deployments. It floats right-aligned next to whichever content it precedes. Imagine we see a comment like the following:

<div style="margin-left:4em;">
{| class="wikitable" width="500px"
|-
| 
Your software is broken. It doesn't even work on Windows ME. When I try to load it, Bill Gates appears on my screen and laughs manically. --[[Special:Mypage|Dogmaster3000]] 01:17, 14 December 2011 (PST)
|}
</div>

Now let's say we want to note that there's a task on Phabricator for this. We'll add the following code: <code><nowiki>{{tracked|T123}}</nowiki></code> (where T123 is the identifier of the task).

<div style="margin-left:4em;">
'''Sample output:'''
{| class="wikitable" style="width: 500px;"
|-
| 
{{Tracked|T123}}

|}
</div>

We can leave it at that. If we'd like to note the fact that the task's been resolved, we can note its status, via <code><nowiki>{{tracked|T123|resolved}}</nowiki></code>. In addition to <code>resolved</code>, we support <code>invalid</code>, <code>duplicate</code>, <code>declined</code>, <code>stalled</code> and <code>open</code>. Example with the <code>resolved</code> keyword:

<div style="margin-left:4em;">
'''Sample output:'''
{| class="wikitable" width="500px"
|-
| 
{{tracked|T123|resolved}}

Of course, feel free to avoid using this template if tracking a comment is not useful.

: You appear to be running the new IE toolbar. This is expected behavior. However, if you upgrade, it will show the angry dancing Ballmer instead. --[[Special:Mypage|GNUnicorn]] 01:38, 14 December 2011 (PST)

==Bugzilla tickets==
For backwards compatibility, this template also accepts the number of a Bugzilla ticket as the first parameter, and the following resolutions: <code>fixed</code>, <code>wontfix</code>, <code>later</code>, <code>invalid</code>. Last but not least, we can mark a bug as critical. We deliberately aren't using this keyword for bugs which are resolved one way or another -- the point of adding this to the template is to note to all readers of the page that the seriousness of a bug has been critical. '''This keyword should only be used if the bug has also been marked as critical in Bugzilla.''' Example usage: <code><nowiki>{{Tracked|300|critical}}</nowiki></code>

<div style="margin-left:4em;">
'''Sample output:'''
{| class="wikitable" width="500px"
|-
| 
{{Tracked|300|critical}}

</div>

If you need the [[phabricator:|Phabricator]] task for a migrated Bugzilla ticket, add 2000 to the BZ bug number and prefix with '''T''', e.g., [[phabricator:T2300|T2300]] replaced [[bugzilla:300]].
