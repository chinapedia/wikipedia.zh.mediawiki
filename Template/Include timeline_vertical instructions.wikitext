'''You're ready to create a template!'''

Just follow these simple steps and you'll be up and running in no time!

* '''Fill in''' the "from" and "to" parameters: these are the only parameters that are required
* '''Copy''' as many bars, notes etc as you need, replacing <code>#</code> with numbers 1, 2, 3… etc.
* '''Delete''' any parameters you don't need

''Remember'':
* You can set <code>help</code> to <code>on</code>, the press "preview", to view useful information
* You must use <tt>{</tt><tt>{!}}</tt> wherever you want a | to be rendered in the timeline
* Large borders will displace bars in many browsers
* Text should not be wider than its containing bar, as this may cause compatibility issues - use <<code>br</code>> to create a new line
* Units default to [[em (typography){{!}}em]], the height and width of an 'M'.
