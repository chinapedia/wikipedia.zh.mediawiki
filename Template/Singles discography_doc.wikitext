{{intricate template}}

== Usage ==
This template is for rendering tables of [[single (music)|single]] releases in artist discographies (both as separate articles and sections of another article).

== Parameters ==
*''title<sub>n</sub> (title1, title2, ...)'' – The title of the nth single in the table. Required for every single. Automatically placed in quotes. A current maximum of twenty singles is in effect.
**''note<sub>n</sub> (note1, note2, ...)'' – An optional note to be displayed in brackets after the title. Useful for denoting alternative versions of songs.
**''ref<sub>n</sub> (ref1, ref2, ...)'' – Adds a reference for the nth single, taking this parameter as both name and label. Either single letters or numbers are recommended. Useful for longer notes such as release information. See the {{tl|Ref}} template documentation for more information.
**''title_width'' – The width of the title column in pixels. Defaults to ''200''.

*''year<sub>n</sub> (year1, year2, ...)'' – The release year of the nth single in the table. Required for every single (see below).
**''yearspan<sub>n</sub>'' – Sets the rowspan of ''year<sub>n</sub>''. Repeated year parameters should be removed accordingly.

*''all_albums'' – Adds the column titled "Album" when set to the value ''yes''.
**''album<sub>n</sub> (album1, album2, ...)'' – The album from which the nth single in the table was taken. Required, and only rendered, for every single if ''all_albums'' is set (see below). Automatically placed in italics. In the absence of an album, set to <code><nowiki></i>Non-album single<i></nowiki></code> to bypass the italics.
**''albumspan<sub>n</sub>'' – Sets the rowspan of ''album<sub>n</sub>''. Repeated album parameters should be removed accordingly.
**''album_width'' – The width of the album column in pixels. Defaults to ''150''.

*''all_certs'' – Adds the column titled "Certifications" when set to the value ''yes''.
**''cert<sub>n</sub> (cert1, cert2, ...)'' – Any certifications received by the nth single in the table. Only rendered if ''all_certs'' is set. Include any references, and line breaks between certifications.
**''cert_width'' – The width of the certifications column in pixels. Defaults to ''150''.

*''charts'' – The number of charts to be rendered in the table. Charts are rendered in order and surplus charts are ignored, even if rendered charts contain no data. If unspecified no charts are included in the table. A current maximum of ten charts is in effect.
**''chart<sub>x</sub> (chartA, chartB, ...)'' – Details for each chart in the table. Include the country code, a link to the relevant chart, and any references for the chart. Only rendered for the number of charts specified by ''charts''.
**''chart<sub>x</sub>_width'' – The width of the chart<sub>x</sub> column. Defaults to ''3em'', a value of ''4.5em'' is recommended for component charts.
**''peak<sub>nx</sub> (peak1A, peak2B, ...)'' – The peak chart position of the nth single in the table in chart<sub>x</sub>. Only rendered for the number of charts specified by ''charts''. If left blank or not included, this parameter defaults to an em dash (—).

*''include_footnote'' – Adds a footnote to the table containing the text: ''"—" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that country.'' Advised if there are any singles which did not appear in one of the rendered charts.
