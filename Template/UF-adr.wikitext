The HTML mark up produced by this template includes an [[HCard#Adr| ADR microformat]], which makes postal addresses (or their component parts, such as regions, postal codes or country-names) [[Parsing|parsable]] by computers, either acting automatically to catalogue articles across Wikipedia, or via a browser tool operated by a person, to (for example) add the subject to an address book. For more information about the use of [[microformat]]s on Wikipedia, please see [[WP:UF|the microformat project]].

ADR uses HTML classes including:
{{Flatlist/microformat|
*adr
*country-name
*extended-address
*locality
*postal-code
*region
*street-address
}}

Please do not rename or remove these classes.
