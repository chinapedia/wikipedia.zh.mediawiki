'''<nowiki>{{Infobox artist discography}}</nowiki>''' is the standard infobox for [[discography]] articles, and is within the purview of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Albums|WikiProject Albums]]. Please discuss major changes on the [[Template talk:Infobox artist discography|talk page]] before making them.

This template is designed for use in discography articles within [[:Category:Discographies]]. It displays the number of [[studio album]]s, [[live album]]s, [[compilation album]]s, [[Single (music)|singles]], [[VHS single|video releases]], [[Extended play|EPs]], etc., by an artist or group.

==Placement==
This template should be placed in an article at the top of the page, before the introduction.

===Basic usage===
{{Infobox artist discography

===Fields===
When using the template, it is not necessary to delete any fields that are not being used. Most fields are optional; if no data is supplied, the row will simply not appear once the page is saved.

====Artist====
The name of the group or artist ("the act") in plain text only. Logos and other graphics are to be avoided in this field in accordance with [[WP:ACCESS]] and [[WP:FAIR]]. Use an internal link or [[Wikipedia:Piped link|piped]] internal link  to the main article about the artist. For help with internal links, see the [[Wikipedia:Editing FAQ#How do I make links?|Editing FAQ]]. This field is mandatory.

====Image====
An image of the act, sufficiently clear for display at 200 pixels' width. Set to only the image name, e.g. {{xt|Example.png}}, not {{!xt|Image:Example.png}} or {{!xt|<nowiki>[[Image:Example.png|200px|abc]]</nowiki>}}. Images used should ideally be free images; that is, not subject to copyright restrictions. If no free image is available it may be possible to use a non-free image under a claim of fair use, provided the image meets Wikipedia's non-free content criteria (for more information see [[WP:NFCC]] and [[WP:NFC]]).

====Alt====
Alt text for the image, as per [[WP:ALT]]. This is for describing the image to people who cannot see the image, and typically should not be the same as the caption.

====Caption====
Caption for the image to be displayed. Do not link years in the caption e.g. '''do not''' link <nowiki>[[2007]]</nowiki>.

====Types of releases====
There are individual fields for the various types of releases (studio, live, compilation, video, music videos, tribute, EP, singles, b-sides, and soundtrack). In each field place the number of each type that the artist has released. Use only numeric values in these fields. For other types of releases, see "Advanced usage" below.

===Advanced usage===
====Optional labels====
:''Please use these functions sparingly.''
As not all musical artists are the same, some will have the need to have different labels for their discography, such as a collaboration or unreleased songs. To list these options, use {{para|Option}} and {{para|Option name}} and up to three additional options, as in the example below.

{{Infobox artist discography

| Alt             = Photograph of band playing
