===Description of fields===
(See [[Template talk:Infobox Block cipher|talk page]] for an example)

All fields except for ''name'' are optional.

====Header====
;''name''    : Name of the cipher or hash function (or preferably its abbreviation if the expansion contains multiple words and would not fit well).
;''image''   : An illustrative image for the cipher or hash function; e.g. for Feistel-structured ciphers, this would typically be an illustration of the cipher's Feistel function.
;''caption'' : (Only if the image field is specified) caption for the image.

====General====
;''designers''     : Names of the designers/authors of the cipher or hash function, separated by commas. Should not contain organization names ''unless'' names of the real authors are unknown. The names should be linked if articles about them exist.
;''publish date''  : Date that the cipher or hash function was first presented. If the exact date is unknown, this should at least contain the year number.
;''series''        : A comma-separated list of ciphers or hash functions in a series, usually named similarly. For example, <!--... (block cipher);--> "MD, [[MD2]], MD3, [[MD4]], [[MD5]]" (hash function).
;''derived from''  : A comma-separated list of ciphers or hash functions that inspired the design of the block cipher or hash function. (Do not duplicate ''series'' here.)
;''derived to''    : A comma-separated list of ciphers or hash functions whose design was inspired by the block cipher or hash function. (Do not duplicate ''series'' here.)
;''related to''    : A list of ciphers or hash functions that are otherwise related to the cipher or hash function. This field should be used minimally, and only when the relation is clearly significant.
;''certification'' : Cryptography expert groups that have selected or recommended this algorithm. For example, "[[AES finalist]]", "[[NESSIE]]", "[[CRYPTREC]]".

====Detail====
;''digest size''     : (hash functions only) Size of hash function digest output in bits. Should include the suffix "bits"; for example, "128 bits".
;''key size''        : (block or stream ciphers only) Key size or sizes that the cipher was originally designed to operate with, in bits. Should contain the suffix "bits". May contain multiple sizes. For example, AES submissions would have "128, 192 or 256 bits"
;''security claim''  : Any security claim or claims that the cipher or hash function was originally designed to achieve, in bits. Should contain the suffix "bits". May contain multiple sizes. For example, "128, 192 or 256 bits".
;''block size''      : (block ciphers only) Size or sizes of the input and output blocks of the block cipher. Should contain the suffix "bits". May contain multiple sizes.
;''state size''      : (stream ciphers only) Size of the stream cipher's internal state. Should contain the suffix "bits".
;''structure''       : If the cipher or hash function follows a common structure. For example, typical block ciphers should state "[[Feistel network]]" or "[[Substitution-permutation network]]" here.
;''rounds''          : The number or numbers of rounds the cipher or hash function was originally designed to work with.
;''speed''           : Speed of the algorithm, usually given in cpb (''[[cycles per byte]]''). NB! Do not conduct [[WP:OR|your own measurements]]; only cite published analysis. Also useful to include the [[processor architecture]] where measurements were done.
;''cryptanalysis''   : The best-known cryptanalysis for the cipher or hash function. Should contain a brief overview of the vulnerabilities and a [[WP:FOOT|footnote]] link to a relevant reference or references.
