This template is to be used in the references section of an article in order to identify that it contains text taken from the {{tsl|en|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships||Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships}} (DANFS). If the article does not contain text from DANFS, it should not be used. 

*Placing the template <nowiki>{{DANFS}}</nowiki> on the article results in:
:{{DANFS}}

*The template allows for directly linking to the DANFS article in question. For example: using <nowiki>{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c13/constellation-i.htm}}</nowiki> links directly to the article on {{USS|Constellation|1797}} and results in: 

:{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c13/constellation-i.htm}}

*The template also allows linking for two DANFS articles. By using the parameters <nowiki>{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c13/constellation-i.htm|http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/frigates/constell.htm}}</nowiki> you may link to the more recent DANFS article and the original DANFS article listed at Hazegray. This results in:

:{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/c13/constellation-i.htm|http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/frigates/constell.htm}}
