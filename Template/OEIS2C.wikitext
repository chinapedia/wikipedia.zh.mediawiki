This template, primarily meant for mathematical articles, provides a means to include links to Neil Sloane's [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] (OEIS). If the article has more than one OEIS citation, consider using [[Template:OEIS]] for the first citation and this template for the second and all later citations. That template provides a link to Wikipedia's article about the OEIS, while this template only provides a link to the desired OEIS sequence page.

Example: Either {{tlp|OEIS2C|id{{=}}A001420}} or {{tlp|OEIS2C|A001420}} makes {{OEIS2C|id=A001420}}
