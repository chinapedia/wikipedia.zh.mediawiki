This is the template for encoding the left side of a tropical cyclone statistics table line, including the new row start.

== Usage ==

The invoking syntax of this template is <nowiki>{{TC stats cyclone|cat=|name=|dates=|max-winds=|min-press=|ace=|mult-landfalls=}}</nowiki>.

:* ''cat'' must be a value from the left-side column of the following table
::{{TC stats cat doc table}}
:* ''name'' is the name/designation of the storm 
:** Do not include qualifiers such as "Hurricane" in the name.  For example, for the 11th named storm of the [[2005 Atlantic hurricane season]], this parameter should read "Katrina", '''not''' "Hurricane Katrina".)
:* ''dates'' is the active date range of the storm.  
:** The suggested format is "day1 - day2 Month",  with the month abbeviated if its name is longer than four characters.
:** When a storm starts and ends in different month, the suggested syntax is "day1 Month1 - day2 Month2".
:** The months should be a link to that month, and the days and link to that day of its month.
:* ''max-winds'' is the maximum winds in [[miles per hour]].
:* ''min-press'' is the minimum pressure in [[millibars]].
:* ''ace'' is the total [[Accumulated Cyclone Energy]] (ACE) for the cyclone.
:* ''mult-landfalls'' is optional.  It indicates that number of landfalls the cyclone had when more than one occurred.  (This controls the number of rows used by the cells created.  The default value is 1.)
