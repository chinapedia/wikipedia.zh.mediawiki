本模板為實現與[[英文維基百科]]相容之模板所創建，如有任何問題，請於[[Template talk:Weather box|討論頁]]提出。對於較短的形式，見下文：[[#精簡版|精簡版]]。

*可選擇以[[#僅填寫英制的模板|英-{制}-單位]]、[[#僅填寫公制的模板|公-{制}-單位]]或[[#全空模板|兩者]]輸入數據。
*沒有使用的參數項可刪去。
*所有項目是選填，<code>location</code>和<code>source</code>（或<code>source 1</code>）除外。
*如果12個月的數據已填入，「全年」的數值會自動產生。
*同一行的所有數據請使用同一精確度，例如 Jan 是0而 Feb 是0.3，則 Jan 填0.0。
*如果同一頁面使用多個表格，或上面有圖像或信息框，請檢查模板不會在該頁面遮蓋其它「物件」或被其它「物件」遮蓋。請使用「顯示預覽」及不同的「字體縮放」測試。如有需要，可在「氣候」章節前加上 {{Tlx|Clear}}，或在表格前加 <nowiki><div style="width:50%;"></nowiki>及在表格後加 <nowiki></div></nowiki>。
