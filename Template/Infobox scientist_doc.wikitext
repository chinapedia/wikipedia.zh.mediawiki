===Guidelines===
Note: "Lists" in the following are usually suitable for presentation using {{tl|ublist}} (unbulleted list, one item per line) or {{tl|hlist}} (horizontal list, item by item with linewrap).
; name          : This is the name that scientist was usually known by. Do not put the full expanded name here.
; image         : This is the portrait or photo of the scientist. If there is a choice between good images, chose the one from a period where the scientist's work flourished. Avoid photos where the scientist was a child or very elderly, unless there is nothing else available.
; image_size    : This should normally be left at the default image size which will let users change the size to their own preference.
; alt           : This should describe only the visual appearance of the image, for visually-impaired readers. It should not repeat the caption. See [[WP:ALT]].
; caption       : The caption should contain the full expanded name of the scientist, year or birth and death, if available, and any relevant details about the photo or portrait.
; birth_name    : Birth name of scientist. Use only if different from name in header. This parameter will be displayed in the "born" field, before birth date and birthplace.
; birth_date    : Birth date of scientist. Use the full formatting that computes the scientist's age.
; birth_place   : Birthplace of scientist. Put town/city followed by country.
; death_date    : Death date of scientist. Use the full formatting that computes the scientists age.
; death_place   : Death place of scientist. Put town/city followed by country. Note: this is the place where the person died, which might be different from burial place.
; resting_place : Where the scientist was buried, or their ashes scattered
; resting_place_coordinates: WGS84 coordinates for {{para||resting_place}}. Only use if known precisely (i.e. do not give generic coordinates for the cemetery). Use {{Tl|Coord}}. 
; residence     : List countries only. Put a line break after each one. These are places where the scientist lived for significant periods. The intention is that these are countries of domicile. Do not include countries where the scientist temporarily resided for brief collaboration or study leave.
; citizenship   : List countries only. Put a line break after each one. This is the scientist's citizenship, which often can be different from country of domicile or residency.
; nationality   : List country only. Only insert this if it is different from citizenship.
; fields        : List the scientist's principal field or fields of work as described in the article, e.g. Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Physiology, Molecular biology, Electronic engineering etc. Avoid using occupations, e.g. Physicist, Zoologist, Surgeon, Inventor. 
; workplaces    : List the key work places, universities, companies, organizations etc. that the scientist worked at. The intention is to not list minor places that the scientist performed collaborative visits at. The intention is to list places where the scientist was officially appointed with a payroll (i.e. don't list places that represent adjunct appointments).
; patrons       : List notable benefactors who financially supported the scientist's education and/or research.
; alma_mater    : List the universities where the scientist obtained all his/her degrees from. In anomalous cases where a degree was carried out remotely or in a different university to the university that administered the degree, insert the administering university. The main article can then discuss the specific situation.
; thesis_title  : (or ''thesis1_title'' and ''thesis2_title'')&nbsp; If the scientist obtained a [[doctorate]] or doctorates, insert the thesis/theses titles, otherwise leave blank.
; thesis_url    : (or ''thesis1_url'' and ''thesis2_url'')&nbsp; A link or links to e.g. abstract/s of the scientist's thesis/theses at a university library, or their homepage, etc.
; thesis_year   : (or ''thesis1_year'' and ''thesis2_year'')&nbsp; The year/s in which the scientist's thesis/theses were published.
; doctoral_advisor  : (or ''doctoral_advisors'')&nbsp; If the scientist obtained a doctorate, insert their doctoral advisor or advisors, otherwise leave blank.
; academic_advisors : Insert names of significant academic teachers other than the doctoral advisor: e.g. Master's advisor, postdoctoral supervisor, significant undergraduate mentor/teacher etc. In Cambridge, before 1919, there was no doctorate and so you can insert the relevant Cambridge tutor.
; doctoral_students : Insert names of doctoral students supervised by the scientist. If a student does not have a wiki article, then comment the name out. It can be reinstated once such an article appears. The idea is to list only those students who are significant enough to warrant their own article.
; notable_students  : Insert names of any notable non-doctoral students taught or supervised by the scientist. These can be undergraduates, postdocs, masters students etc. If a student does not have a wiki article, then comment the name out.
; known_for     : Insert the key topics/areas for which the scientist is notable, e.g. "discovering the electron". In the case of prolific scientists, preferably list the discoveries named after the scientist, e.g. "Maxwell's equations". In the case where a scientist is so prolific that a whole wiki article listing the discoveries exists, insert a link to that page under the label (in italics) "''see list''" (i.e. {{mono|100%|<nowiki>''[[(link)|see list]]''</nowiki>}}).
; author_abbrev_bot : If a scientist is the author of a botanical species, insert their [[Author citation (botany)|botanical author abbreviation]] here. Otherwise leave blank.
; author_abbrev_zoo : If a scientist is the author of a zoological species, insert their [[Author citation (zoology)|zoological author abbreviation]] here. Otherwise leave blank.
; spouse        : (or ''spouses'')&nbsp; Name/s of{{\}}link/s to the scientist's spouse/s.
; partner       : (or ''partners'')&nbsp; Name/s of{{\}}link/s to the scientist's partner/s.
; influences    : List names of any notable people who influenced the scientist significantly. Influences should be restricted to a small number, i.e. two or three, where the scientist was clearly and directly building on the work of a predecessor (for example, the scientist may have identified a predecessor as providing the foundation for one of their major achievements). Unless the scientist was clearly building on an earlier work, avoid adding influences that were only via study, as such influences are generally too many and hard to separate. Only list influences who are notable enough to warrant their own wiki article.
; influenced    : List names of any notable people who were significantly influenced by the scientist. Influenced should be restricted to a small number (perhaps two or three), where the scientist clearly and directly provided the foundation for work by a later thinker. For example, the scientist may be named by the later thinker as providing the basis for one of their major works. Unless the later thinker was clearly building on the scientist's work, avoid adding names that were only influenced by study of the scientist, as such influences are generally too many and hard to separate. Only list influenced people who are notable enough to warrant their own wiki article.
; awards        : List major awards. Put year of award in brackets after name of award. Insert a line break after each award. Avoid awards that are not significant enough to withstand their own wiki article description.
; signature     : Filename of an image of the scientist's handwritten signature (if available).
; signature_alt : Alt text for the signature. Typically this is just the text of the signature (e.g. "Is. Newton" for [[:File:Isaac Newton signature.svg]]).
; website       : Official website only. Unofficial websites should be placed under <nowiki>==External links==</nowiki> in the body of the article. Use {{tl|URL}} as <nowiki>{{URL|www.example.com}}</nowiki>.
; footnotes     : For any footnotes needed to clarify entries above. This section is also often used to add extra notable items, typically, if the scientist is a relative of another person with a wiki article.

; Common errors to avoid
:* Always copy and paste the infobox template from here, not another article, in order to guarantee the full correct version.
:* If a field does not apply, leave it blank. Do not delete it. This is because is acts as a place-holder and future editors may find a field applies after all. You may put a comment in the blank field that it is not applicable if you are sure of this.
