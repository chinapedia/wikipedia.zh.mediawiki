=== 目的 ===

In North America elevations are given using either {{tsl|en|Sea Level Datum of 1929||Sea Level Datum of 1929}}, also called the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD 29) or the {{tsl|en|North American Vertical Datum of 1988||North American Vertical Datum of 1988}} (NAVD 88). Confusion often occurs when a user sees an elevation value using the newer datum. The typical reaction is to assume the elevation is incorrect and in fact the user can find reliable documentation based on the Sea Level Datum of 1929 to support their assumption. This simple template will aid editors to document that the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 is being used.

=== 用法 ===
<code><nowiki>The elevation of [[惠特尼峰|Mount Whitney]] is {{convert|14505|ft}}{{NAVD88}}</nowiki></code> → The elevation of [[惠特尼峰|Mount Whitney]] is {{convert|14505|ft}}{{NAVD88}}
