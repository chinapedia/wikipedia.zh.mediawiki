== 模板介紹 ==

本模板用於展示一場選舉中的候選人和選舉結果，其效果如下:

{{Election box begin |名稱=[[United Kingdom general election, 2005|General Election 2005]]: Strangford}}
{{Election box candidate with party link
  |政黨      = Labour Party (UK)
  |候選人    = Tony Blair
  |票數      = 9,999
  |百分比    = 50.0
  |增減      = +10.0
}}
{{Election box candidate with party link
  |政黨      = Conservative Party (UK)
  |候選人    = Michael Howard
  |票數      = 9,999
  |百分比    = 50.0
  |增減      = +10.0
}}
 {{Election box majority
   |票數      = 9,999
   |百分比    = 50.0
   |增減      = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box turnout
   |票數      = 9,999
   |百分比    = 50.0
   |增減      = +10.0
 }}
{{Election box end}}

== 使用方法 ==
===基本===
整個模板由以下三部份構成：
*{{tl|Election box begin}}
*{{tl|Election box candidate}}
*{{tl|Election box end}}

''begin''及''end''兩個部分分別用於開啟和結束本模板，而''candidate''部分則用於展示其中一位候選人的資料及在表格中構建一個新橫行。有多少個候選人，就需要多少個''candidate''部分。

使用此模板時，請'''務必'''使用''election box end''部分，若此部分被<nowiki>|}</nowiki>代替，將產生需要人手修正的錯誤，帶來麻煩。 

舉個例子:
 <nowiki>
 {{Election box begin 
   |名稱=[[United Kingdom general election, 2005|General Election 2005]]: Strangford}}
 {{Election box candidate
   |政黨      = Labour Party (UK)
   |候選人    = Tony Blair
   |票數      = 9,999
   |百分比    = 50.0
   |增減      = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box candidate
   |政黨      = Conservative Party (UK)
   |候選人    = Michael Howard
   |票數      = 9,999
   |百分比    = 50.0
   |增減      = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box end}}
 </nowiki>

將產生以下效果:
 {{Election box begin 
   |名稱=[[United Kingdom general election, 2005|General Election 2005]]: Strangford}}
 {{Election box candidate
   |政黨      = Labour Party (UK)
   |候選人    = Tony Blair
   |票數      = 9,999
   |百分比    = 50.0
   |增減      = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box candidate
   |政黨      = Conservative Party (UK)
   |候選人    = Michael Howard
   |票數      = 9,999
   |百分比    = 50.0
   |增減      = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box end}}

===政黨連結===
請參見[[Template:Election box candidate with party link]]。

===多數票及投票率===
以下是兩個進階模板:

* {{tl|Election box majority}}
* {{tl|Election box turnout}}

上述兩個模板分別用於展示一場選舉中的多數票及投票率。(''多數票''在此表示得票第一高與第二高的候選人之間的得票差距)。

舉個例子:
 <nowiki>
 ...
 {{Election box majority
   |votes      = 9,999
   |percentage = 50.0
   |change     = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box turnout
   |votes      = 9,999
   |percentage = 50.0
   |change     = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box end}}
 </nowiki>

將產生以下效果:
{{Election box begin |title=[[United Kingdom general election, 2005|General Election 2005]]: Strangford}}
{{Election box candidate with party link
  |party      = Labour Party (UK)
  |candidate  = Tony Blair
  |votes      = 9,999
  |percentage = 50.0
  |change     = +10.0
}}
{{Election box candidate with party link
  |party      = Conservative Party (UK)
  |candidate  = Michael Howard
  |votes      = 9,999
  |percentage = 50.0
  |change     = +10.0
}}
 {{Election box majority
   |votes      = 9,999
   |percentage = 50.0
   |change     = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box turnout
   |votes      = 9,999
   |percentage = 50.0
   |change     = +10.0
 }}
{{Election box end}}

===選舉結果===
還有兩個模板:

* {{tl|Election box hold with party link}}
* {{tl|Election box gain with party link}}

上述模板用於總結選舉結果，指出現任議員是否連任成功。

舉個例子:
 <nowiki>
 ...
 {{Election box hold with party link
   |winner     = Labour Party (UK)
   |swing      = +10.0
 }}

 or...

 {{Election box gain with party link
   |winner     = Conservative Party (UK)
   |loser      = Labour Party (UK)
   |swing      = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box end}}
 </nowiki>

將產生以下效果:
{{Election box begin |title=[[United Kingdom general election, 2005|General Election 2005]]: Strangford}}
{{Election box candidate with party link
  |party      = Labour Party (UK)
  |candidate  = Tony Blair
  |votes      = 9,999
  |percentage = 50.0
  |change     = +10.0
}}
{{Election box candidate with party link
  |party      = Conservative Party (UK)
  |candidate  = Michael Howard
  |votes      = 9,999
  |percentage = 50.0
  |change     = +10.0
}}
 {{Election box majority
   |votes      = 9,999
   |percentage = 50.0
   |change     = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box turnout
   |votes      = 9,999
   |percentage = 50.0
   |change     = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box hold with party link
   |winner     = Labour Party (UK)
   |swing      = +10.0
 }}
{{Election box end}}

另一個例子:

{{Election box begin |title=[[United Kingdom general election, 2005|General Election 2005]]: Strangford}}
{{Election box candidate with party link
  |party      = Labour Party (UK)
  |candidate  = Tony Blair
  |votes      = 9,999
  |percentage = 50.0
  |change     = +10.0
}}
 {{Election box candidate with party link
  |party      = Conservative Party (UK)
  |candidate  = Michael Howard
  |votes      = 9,999
  |percentage = 50.0
  |change     = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box majority
   |votes      = 9,999
   |percentage = 50.0
   |change     = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box turnout
   |votes      = 9,999
   |percentage = 50.0
   |change     = +10.0
 }}
 {{Election box gain with party link
   |winner     = Conservative Party (UK)
   |loser      = Labour Party (UK)
   |swing      = +10.0
 }}
{{Election box end}}

Notes:
*The ''swing'' parameter represents [[Peter Snow]]'s [[Swingometer]] measure, ie the percentage change (or swing) in the vote since the last election.
*When preparing the tables in advance of an election, it may be convenient to include these two templates but commented out (using <code> &lt;!-- and --> </code>) until the outcome is known.
*Potentially there is a need for versions of these templates that do not have the ''party link'' mechanism.  However, it can be argued that any party that has a successful candidate deserves an article about them and the full /meta/color treatment.  The one obvious exception to this is, of course, independent candidates, who won't actually have a party.  If / when there's a need, just create a non ''party link'' version of these templates.

{{List of Election Box Templates}}

===Blanks by country===
* [[Template:Election box/UK-blanks|United Kingdom]]

===Extensions===
*[[Template:Election FPTP begin]] As 1, but includes an additional column for expenditures. [[Bulkley Valley-Stikine|Example]]
*[[Template:Election box begin for list]] As 1, but better suited to list-based multi-member constituencies. [[London (European Parliament constituency)|Example]]
*[[Template:Election box candidate for alliance]] As 3, with an additional "side" party. [[Newbury (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections_in_the_1980s|Example]]
