{{tl|{{PAGENAME}}}} is a utility which superimposes one image over another, and positions it relative to the top left corner of the bottom image. Although [[w:Template:GBthumb|the original idea]] was to place a dot on a locator map based on editable coordinates, it can be used to precisely overlay any two images for any reason.

==Usage==

===Example===

<div style="float: right;">
{{Superimpose
  | base = US_Locator_Blank.svg
  | base_width = 288px
  | base_alt = Located in north central Colorado, which in turn is just west of the center of the U.S.
  | base_caption = United States Locator Map
  | float = Red Dot.svg
  | float_width = 10px
  | x = 95
  | y = 80
}}
</div>
<pre style="overflow:auto;">
{{Superimpose
  | base = US_Locator_Blank.svg
  | base_width = 288px
  | base_alt = Located in north central Colorado, which in turn is just west of the center of the U.S.
  | base_caption = United States Locator Map
  | float = Red Dot.svg
  | float_width = 10px
  | x = 95
  | y = 80
}}
</pre>

<div style="clear: both"></div>

=== Using the Template ===

To get started, you can simply copy this blank definition into your page, and fill in the data.

<pre>
{{Superimpose
  | base = 
  | base_width = 
  | base_alt = 
  | base_caption = 
  | float = 
  | float_width = 
  | x = 
  | y = 
}}
</pre>

The following blank definition includes all the parameters, including those less-commonly used.

<pre>
{{Superimpose
  | base = 
  | base_width = 
  | base_alt = 
  | base_caption = 
  | base_link = 
  | float = 
  | float_alt = 
  | float_width = 
  | float_caption = 
  | float_link = 
  | x = 
  | y = 
}}
</pre>

=== Parameter Definitions ===

* '''base:''' File name of the base (bottom) image
* '''base_width:''' Width to display the base image, ''in pixels''
* '''base_alt:''' [[Alt text]] for the image, for visually impaired readers; see ''[[Wikipedia:Alternative text for images]]''. This normally describes the combination of the two images.
* '''base_caption:''' Text to show when a user's mouse hovers over the base image; ignored if '''base_link''' is specified to be empty
* '''base_link:''' Name of page that the user should be sent to if they click on the base image. The special value "<code>file:</code>", stands for the file page for the base image. If empty, nothing happens if the user clicks on the base image. The default is "<code>file:</code>".
* '''float:'''  File name of the top image
* '''float_width:'''  Width to display the top image, ''in pixels''
* '''float_alt:''' Alt text for the top image. This is needed only if '''float_link''' is nonempty. Normally the alt text for the base image describes the combination of the two images, and this parameter is not needed.
* '''float_caption:''' Text to show when a user's mouse hovers over the top image; ignored if '''float_link''' is missing or empty
* '''float_link:''' Name of page that the user should be sent to if they click on the top image. This acts like '''base_link''', except it is for the top image, and it defaults to empty.
* '''x:''' distance to offset the top image from the left edge of the base image, ''in pixels or any other CSS-standard units''
* '''y:''' distance to offset the top image from the top edge of the base image, ''in pixels or any other CSS-standard units''

=== A Note about the Locator Dot ===

I originally built this template thinking I could use an SVG file with transparency (mostly for the dot in locator maps). However, it seems Internet Explorer users can't handle transparent PNGs without a fix that Wikimedia's not yet delivering, so for now I recommend using the GIF version in the example above. When IE better supports PNGs, we can swap the better format back in.
