{{{icon|[[File:Information.svg|25px]] }}}歡迎蒞臨維基百科。 Your recent contributions to {{<includeonly>safesubst:</includeonly>#if:{{{1|}}}|the Wikipedia article [[:{{{1}}}]]|Wikipedia}} are very much appreciated.  However, please take a moment to review your contributions for spelling, grammatical, capitalization, and punctuation errors before you save. This will help lessen the amount of copyediting others must do on the article, and will help maintain a consistent, encyclopedic appearance of Wikipedia. You might want to consider using the [http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/ Firefox] web browser, which has spell-check built-in, installing the [http://www.iespell.com/ ieSpell] extension for Internet Explorer, or [http://www.opera.com/support/tutorials/opera/spellcheck/ setting up spell-check for Opera].

This message is not meant to discourage you from editing Wikipedia but rather to encourage the best possible writing from our authors. Please take a look at the [[Wikipedia:MOS|Manual of Style]] and the [[Wikipedia:Welcome|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. {{<includeonly>safesubst:</includeonly>#if:{{{2|}}}|{{{2}}}|Thank you.}}<!-- Template:uw-spellcheck --><noinclude>
