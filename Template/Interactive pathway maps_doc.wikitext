__NOTOC__
This template is the product of a custom export process of [http://www.wikipathways.org WikiPathways] content as interactive pathway maps for Wikipedia articles. Please do not edit these templates directly as they include calculated hyperlinks and annotations based on original content curated at [http://www.wikipathways.org WikiPathways]. Please feel free to edit and update the pathway content at [http://www.wikipathways.org WikiPathways]. Your changes will be reflected here when the template is regenerated. 

The collaborative design of this template, which is actually a set of nested templates with an image map at the core, was [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology/Proposals/Archive 4#Adding interactive pathway maps|initially proposed and refined]] in collaboration with [[Portal:Gene Wiki|Gene Wiki]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Molecular and Cellular Biology|MCB]]. Please review the background of this discussion before making edits. Feel free to make suggestions in the associated talk pages.

== 模板介紹 ==
* '''Gene links''' - click on blue-underlined gene boxes in pathway to go to the corresponding Gene Wiki article
* '''Metabolite links''' - click on blue-underlined metabolite boxes in pathway to go to the corresponding metabolite article
* '''Start new pages''' - click on red-underlined boxes to start a ''new'' Wikipedia article where one currently does not exist
* '''Bold self links''' - the gene or metabolite focused on in the current article is displayed as a bold-bordered self link
* '''Pathway links''' - click anywhere in the background on the pathway to go to the corresponding pathway article with an expanded view of the interactive pathway map
* '''Variable-controlled cropped view''' - pathway maps can be cropped by referencing a gene or metabolite ''(see Usages #2 and #3 below)''.
* '''Variable-controlled scroll view''' - pathway maps can be viewed in a scrollable window at a particular width and height ''(see Usage #4 below)''.

== 參數及使用方法 ==
This template is commonly transcluded into the following types of articles in the following ways:
<br>1. '''Pathway articles'''
:: Where you want to see the full pathway
 <nowiki>{{</nowiki>TCACycle_WP78<nowiki>}}</nowiki>
<br>2. '''[[Portal:Gene Wiki|Gene Wiki]] articles'''
:: Where you want to crop the pathway view to center on a particular gene
 <nowiki>{{</nowiki>TCACycle_WP78|highlight=Dihydrolipoyl_transacetylase<nowiki>}}</nowiki>
<br>3. '''Metabolite articles'''
:: Where you want to crop the pathway view to center on a particular metabolite
 <nowiki>{{</nowiki>TCACycle_WP78|highlight=Fumaric_acid<nowiki>}}</nowiki>
<br>4. '''Miscellaneous'''
:: Where you override default views and specify the width and height of a scrollable window in which to view the entire pathway
 <nowiki>{{</nowiki>TCACycle_WP78|width=600|height=300<nowiki>}}</nowiki>
*<code>width</code>: the width of the scrollable window
*<code>height</code>: the height of the scrollable window
<br>5. '''PLEASE DO NOT'''
:: Please do not transclude below the References section or into other templates commonly transcluded below the Reference section. This produces a red warning (missing refs tag) due to the use of in-line references. Thank you!

== 範例 ==
* [[Citric acid cycle|Citric acid cycle pathway]]
* [[Dihydrolipoyl_transacetylase#Interactive_pathway_map|DLAT gene wiki article]]
* Where is [[Special:WhatLinksHere/{{NAMESPACE}}:{{PAGENAME}}|this template]] used?

== Known Issues ==
* When there is more than one copy of a gene or metabolite on a pathway, clicking on any copy will lead to the same page (as expected) and to the same highlighted and centered view (which may or may not be the particular copy you clicked on). This is because the highlighting and centering are determined by the variable passed in to the template and not by what exactly you click on. So, when using this template on a gene or metabolite article, take note of which copy (if there is more than one) is being highlighted in the view. The template knows about the other copies and you can choose which is the best representative copy to highlight by passing in the right variable. The first copy is given the name of the article (e.g., '''Apple_acid'''); additional copies are named "alt1", "alt2", etc. (e.g., '''Apple_acid__alt1'''). Note the two underscore characters between the name and the "alt" designation.  In this way you can preview and decide which copy you want to highlight on a given gene or metabolite article.
