Walraversijde was discovered on the Belgian coast by the archeologist Marnix Pieters in 1992 in a dune area, near a medieval dyke. Prior to discovery, Walraversijde was a lost village, with no obvious remains above ground. Two related sites were excavated, one on a beach and the other on a [[polder]]. The beach site was inhabited between 1200 and 1400, and the polder site was inhabited between 1400 and 1630. The excavations also found evidence of activities during the Roman era, such as a Roman dyke.

Walraversijde played a role during the [[Siege of Ostend]] of 1601-1604, when a Spanish cavalry camp operated from the site. The artefacts and remains are well preserved, and there have been many finds. The sites have been excavated systematically and thoroughly, and have produced unusually rich findings.
