==Usage==
Authors [[Brian Herbert]] and [[Kevin J. Anderson]] used the outlines, notes and unpublished writings of [[Frank Herbert]], found after his death, as supplementary material for their [[Dune (franchise)|''Dune'' universe]] [[prequel]]s and [[sequel]]s, including the ''[[Prelude to Dune]]'' and ''[[Legends of Dune]]'' series, ''[[Hunters of Dune]]'' and ''[[Sandworms of Dune]]''. As the above references to Herbert's notes are therefore cited in many articles, this template keeps them in an easily-implemented and more manageable form.

It should be noted that the very existence of Frank Herbert's notes is a much-debated issue, making references required in any article which mentions them.

Brian Herbert also touches on the topic in the Afterword of ''[[Dune: House Atreides]]''.
