</pre>

== 用法 ==
Using this template for your portal page is easy! Just include these parameters

* '''header''': The header text of the box.
* '''footer''': (optional) The footer text in the box; it link to an archive page that is located at '''Portal:yourportal/Subpage name''' e.g. /Selected picture. If no footer text is passed the default Text is Archive
* '''subpage''': The subpage of the transcluded page, e.g. Selected picture
* '''max''': The maximum number of sub-subpages. Must be a positive integer. Default max=1.
* '''seed''': (optional) The default seed is 17 and can be set to any other integer value (used to generate distinct values on the same page).  Prime numbers work best, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, and 113.

=== Prerequisites ===
* Create a sub-page first. If your portal is '''Portal:''Foo''''', then a sub-page could be '''Portal:''Foo''/Selected ''bar''''';
* On the '''Portal:Foo/Selected ''bar''''' sub-page, place the template {{tl|numbered subpages}} on the page and save it. The template will default to 50 subject sub-pages;
* Once the list of subject links have been created, use one of the '''Selected ''subject''''' templates from below to format each of the subject sub-pages.

== Example ==
<pre>
{{Box-header
|title      = header
|editpage   = Template:Lorem ipsum
|border     = Black 
|titleforeground = #ffe247
|titlebackground = #A9A9A9
|background = #FFFFFF
|foreground = black
}}
{{Lorem ipsum}}
{{Box-footer |Suggest • Archive }}
</pre>

will produce

{{Box-header | title=header
|editpage   = Template:Lorem ipsum
|border     = Black 
|titleforeground = #ffe247
|titlebackground = #A9A9A9
|background = #FFFFFF
|foreground = black
}}
{{Lorem ipsum}}
{{Box-footer |Suggest • Archive }}

== Notes ==
'''Suggest''': a link to a nominate page that is located at '''Portal:yourportal/Nominate/Subpage name''' e.g. /Nominate/Selected picture.
I have found after attempting to get a portal featured that most people want to see a suggest link for all selected content. I loved the original random portal component but in order to add a second link to the bottom of a section you had to turn off the footer and create your own footers (for subpage and suggestions on each content page. So, instead of spending all that time to create links on subpages I thought my time would be better spent adding suggestions to the component itself. 

If you have found this page but don't want to add a suggest link to your section, the original Random portal component can be found at [[Template:Random portal component]].
