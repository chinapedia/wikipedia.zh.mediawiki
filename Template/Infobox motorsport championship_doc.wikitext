# Use ''inaugural2'' instead when no category exists for the championship's first year, or additional text is needed, such as a footnote.
# eg. LMP1, LMP2, GTE
# The total number of drivers/riders from the current or most recent entry list.
# List the current chassis, engine and tyre suppliers with line breaks. If the list is very long, just enter a number.
# Normally only applicable to championships with separate titles for teams and manufacturers/constructors, such as the [[British Touring Car Championship|BTCC]].
