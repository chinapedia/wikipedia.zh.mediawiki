The '''[[French Republican Calendar]]''' was a highly structured, if short-lived, calendar intended to make its users more aware of the natural world around them, and the agricultural processes and products of each season.  The year was divided into 12 months of 30 days, with an extra block of 5 or 6 days to keep it aligned with the solar year.  The days numbered 10, 20 and 30 in each month were associated with an agricultural tool, and the days 5, 15, and 25 were associated with an animal.  The remainder of the days were associated with plants.

== Usage ==
This template formats the information for a given day as a table row, tinting the background of every 5th and 10th day, showing the relevant day and month in the Gregorian calendar, and wikilinking the animals, plants and tools.

Each block of calls to format table rows with {{tl|FrRepCalLine}} should be preceded by a call to {{tl|FrRepCalHead}} to start the table, and followed by a {{tl|FrRepCalFoot}} to close it.

== Syntax ==
 <nowiki>{{ FrRepCalLine | DayNum | Gregorian | FrName | EnName }}</nowiki>
where
* ''DayNum''. The day number (1&ndash;30) for this entry.
* ''Gregorian''.  The associated day number and month name in the Gregorian calendar.
* ''FrName''.  The name of the associated plant, animal or tool.  This is a free text field that is displayed as-is.  It can contain wikilinks.
* ''EnName''.  Optional additional field displayed in the same table cell as the FrName content.  Can be used to define the English translation of the name in French.

== Example ==
 <nowiki>{| style="background:#ffffff;"
 |-
 {{FrRepCalHead | [[Ventôse]] (19 February ~ 20 March) }}
 {{FrRepCalLine | 4 | 22 Feb | Troène | [[Privet]] }}
 {{FrRepCalLine | 5 | 23 Feb | Bouc  | [[Goat|Billygoat]] }}
 {{FrRepCalFoot}}
 |}</nowiki>

is displayed as
{| style="background:#ffffff;"
|-
{{FrRepCalHead | [[Ventôse]] (19 February ~ 20 March) }}
{{FrRepCalLine | 4 | 22 Feb | Troène | [[Privet]] }}
{{FrRepCalLine | 5 | 23 Feb | Bouc  | [[Goat|Billygoat]] }}
{{FrRepCalFoot}}
|}
