<!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE -->
:''Pages with this template are placed in the appropriate category depending on the status selected as shown below.

*<tt>|active</tt> or if left blank = [[:Category:Active WikiProjects]]
*<tt>|Semi-active</tt> = [[:Category:Semi-active WikiProjects]]
*<tt>|inactive</tt> = [[:Category:Inactive WikiProjects]]
*<tt>|defunct</tt> = [[:Category:Defunct WikiProjects]]

Examples:
With no parameters or with the <tt>|active</tt> parameter:
{{WikiProject status}}

=== Usage: Semi-active projects ===
Place this template at the top of any WikiProject that appears to be barely active:
: {{tlx|WikiProject status|Semi-active}}

A project is generally considered semi-active when:
* there have been some, but relatively few, significant changes to the main project page for several months ''or''
* there have been some, but relatively few, discussions on its talk page for several months.

Minor fiddling with formatting, automatic archiving, and unanswered messages to the WikiProject from outsiders ("Could someone with this project please help me with...") or from bots do not count as signs of project activity.

Any editor may add this template to the top of any apparently semi-active WikiProject.  Any member of the project may remove it if it is placed in error.  Upon removal, please consider placing a message on the WikiProject's talk page to indicate that the group is still active.

Example:
{{WikiProject status|Semi-active}}

=== Usage: Inactive projects===
Place this template at the top of any WikiProject:
: {{tlx|WikiProject status|Inactive}}

A project is generally considered inactive when:
* there are no editors listed as members ''or''
* there have been no significant changes to the main project page for four months ''or''
* there have been no discussions on its talk page for four months.

Minor fiddling with formatting, automatic archiving, and unanswered messages to the WikiProject from outsiders ("Could someone with this project please help me with...") or from bots do not count as signs of project activity.

Any editor may add this template to the top of any apparently inactive WikiProject.  Any member of the project may remove it if it is placed in error.  Upon removal, please consider placing a message on the WikiProject's talk page to indicate that the group is still active.

Example:
{{WikiProject status|Inactive}}

=== Usage: Defunct projects ===
Place this template at the top of any WikiProject that appears to be defunct:
: {{tlx|WikiProject status|Defunct}}

Replace the {{tl|inactive}} tag if it is present, or remove the <tt>inactive=yes</tt> parameter from {{tl|Infobox WikiProject}}, if present.

'''Before applying the tag, '''
# process the list of project members, placing indefinitely blocked editors and editors inactive on Wikipedia for more than a year in separate subheadings. Check the project's userbox category/ies for unlisted members. If one or more active editors remain but it is still reasonable to think the project may be defunct, check with those editors individually if they agree.
# if the project has a working assessment system (typically a [[WP:1.0]] banner/category structure), consider whether this information exists elsewhere. Even without activity, it may be useful. Consider proposing a merger with a related project if appropriate.
# consider the likelihood the project may be revived in future. A few projects have a purpose which is so specific that the project may simply be complete (or obsolete). In general, the narrower the scope, or the more it overlaps with other projects, the more reasonable to consider the project defunct. The less the project achieved (some hardly get beyond the proposal stage), the less likely it will be revived. Consider marking or leaving the project marked as merely "inactive".
# consider whether the project may be relevant for [[WP:CSB|Countering Systemic Bias]]. Discuss at [[WP:CSB]] if necessary. If it is, remind relevant related projects of the project's existence, and suggest possible merger.

Any editor may add this template to the top of any apparently defunct WikiProject, after following the steps above.  Any member of the project may remove it if it is placed in error.  Upon removal, please consider placing a message on the WikiProject's talk page to indicate that the group is still active or at least revivable.

Example:
{{WikiProject status|Defunct}}

===Optional parameters===
* <tt>parent=</tt> ''name of parent project, eg Wikipedia:WikiProject South America = <tt>South America</tt>. Providing this adds <tt>"and/or the parent project"</tt> to the "why not join" message.''
* <tt>wp=yes</tt> ''puts the page in [[:Category:Inactive Wikipedia WikiProjects]] instead of [[:Category:Inactive WikiProjects]]''
* <tt>type=</tt> choose from <tt>band, TV show, geo, sports, edu, game, anime and manga</tt>
* <tt>project-type=topic</tt>
* <tt>topic=Foo</tt>
* <tt>taskforce=yes</tt>
