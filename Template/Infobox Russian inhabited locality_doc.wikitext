{{Uses Wikidata|P2046|P2044|P1549|P721|P281|P571|P41|P94|P190|P1082}} 

A live example of the template can be seen in the [[Nizhny Novgorod]] article.

If the settlement was known by another name in the past, the infobox should use the modern name (in accordance with [[WP:MODERNPLACENAME]]), while the article body should use former names where appropriate.
