This template is based on {{tl|archive list}}, but produces a longer three-column list, suitable for '''up to 48''' archives. This template can be applied to any talk page or discussion archive, and will return links to all the numbered archives of that page or its parent page. In order for the template to work, the archives must follow the naming convention specified at [[WP:ARCHIVE]], <tt>Talk:PAGENAME/Archive 1</tt>, with a capital A, a space before the number, and no leading zeros. This template should not be substituted – that way, the list of links will update itself whenever a new numbered archive is added. This template can be used with {{[[Template:archive box|archive box]]}} to produce a box of numbered archive links without entering them all manually. To do this, use <tt><nowiki>{{archive&nbsp;box|auto=long}}</nowiki></tt>.
