== Usage ==
This template shows all text in {{smallcaps|smallcaps}} as a hard format. That is, the caps are permanent, regardless of user preferences. For example:
* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}

The template performs two steps: bare text is changed into uppercase, and it is shown in small caps.

===Difference from {{tlx|smallcaps}}===
The {{tlx|smallcaps}} template is for soft formatting, which is more often what is desired. There are three differences between the templates:<br/>

1. '''All input text is shown in {{smallcaps|small caps}}''', not just the lowercase input. Compare:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps|Hello World}} &rarr; {{smallcaps|Hello World}}
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}
::Note that the initial full capitals are gone.
2. '''The bare, unstyled text is changed into uppercase'''. This is relevant for non-CSS browsers, and when one copy-pastes the page. Compare:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps|Hello World}} &rarr; {{smallcaps|Hello World}}. Copy-paste produces: <code>Hello World</code>
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}. Copy-paste produces: <code>HELLO WORLD</code>
3. '''To maintain initial full capitals, a second parameter is to be used'''. Doing this has no effect on how text is displayed in non-CSS browsers and with copy-paste. Example:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|H|ello}} {{tlx|smallcaps all|W|orld}} &rarr; {{smallcaps all|H|ello}} {{smallcaps all|W|orld}}. Copy-paste produces: <code>HELLO WORLD</code>

===Usage===
{{main|Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Capital letters#Acronyms and initialisms}}
This template should only be used for words, such as acronyms, that should be capitalized regardless of typographic style. Examples are {{smallcaps all|NASA}} and {{smallcaps all|BC/AD}}, which are stylistic variants of NASA and BC/AD. 

It should not be used for things that are not inherently capitalized, such as the use of small caps to distinguish given from family names, because it makes the capitalization permanent, and the reader cannot override it. In such cases, the template {{tl|smallcaps}} should be used instead.

;Examples
To lighten ALL-CAP words, abbreviations, or [[acronym]]s, as a matter of typographic style
* The initialism [[UNESCO|{{smallcaps all|U|nesco}}]] (instead of UNESCO)
* The trademark [[Time (magazine)|{{smallcaps all|T|ime}}]] (instead of TIME)
* Dates such as 625&nbsp;{{smallcaps all|BCE}}

If the template is placed outside a link, it will capitalize the link itself, so in some cases it needs to be placed inside the link.

For the special case of transliterating [[tetragrammaton|''{{smallcaps all|Y|HWH}}'']] as ''the {{lord}}'', as in the King James Bible, there is a dedicated template, {{tl|LORD}}.

Templates that change the display (copy-paste will get the original text):

* {{tl|Allcaps}}   – upper-case display
* {{tl|Nocaps}}    – lower-case display
* {{tl|Smallcaps}} – small-caps display

[[Help:Magic words#Formatting|Magic words]] that rewrite the output (copy-paste will get the text as displayed):

* <nowiki>{{</nowiki>lc:}}      – lower case output of the full text
* <nowiki>{{</nowiki>uc:}}      – upper case output of the full text
* <nowiki>{{</nowiki>lcfirst:}} – lower case output of the first character only
* <nowiki>{{</nowiki>ucfirst:}} – upper case output of the first character only
