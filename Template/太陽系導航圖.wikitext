# - setting this to "bottom-right" will display a (rather large) icon linking to the graphic, if desired

#Notes:
#Details on the new coding for clickable images is here: [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ImageMap]
#The smaller planets have a bit of an overlap just to ensure they're locatable, especially in the belts.
#While it may look strange, it's important to keep the codes for a particular system in order. The clickable coding treats the first object created in an area as the one on top.
# - I've placed moons on "top" so that their smaller circles won't disappear "under" their respective planets or dwarf planets.
#The "poly" code would be more appropriate for the moons of Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. However, there appears to be a bug with that aspect of the code.
# - I've compensated by using oversized circles for those moon groups, and tucking them UNDER their planets for now.
#The Sun is a rectangle as that approximates the edge closely enough for the purposes of this template.
#I've guessed as to the boundaries for the KB, SD, and OC - if they need adjustment, load the image into Paint and use the pencil tool to find the appropriate coordinates.
