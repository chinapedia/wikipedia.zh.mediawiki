''This template is a shortcut template of sorts. ''Nrut7'' stands for "national rugby sevens team". It is used thus: [[Luke Morahan]] plays for <nowiki>{{nrut|Australia}}</nowiki>, which comes out as [[Australia national rugby sevens team|Australia]]''.

'''Please note:''' The display of this template is usually a "deceptive" plain country-name link that readers are unlikely to click on. It is often better to use the template in a compound item that includes "team" or "national team", so the reader knows where it goes.
