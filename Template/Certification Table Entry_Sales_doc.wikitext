== 模板介紹 ==
This is a helper template for [[Template:Certification Table Entry]]. It returns the certification threshold for the specific certification.
It receives the following parameters.

; Mandatory
* <code>award</code> - Silver/Gold/Platinum/Diamond/Million/Billion
* <code>region</code>
* <code>type</code> - album/single/video. If the type set is not supported for the specific region the results are indeterminable 

; Nonmandatory
* <code>number</code> - number of awards certified, for example for a double platinum this will be 2. Default is 1.
* <code>year</code>, <code>month</code>, <code>day</code> - release year, month and day, given as numbers. This is required for some certifications which changed over the years, and the certification threshold goes by release date. The template returns 0 if no sufficient release date is provided or if there isn't a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] about the certification levels at the release date.
* <code>certyear</code>, <code>certmonth</code> - certification year, month, given as numbers. This is required for some certifications which changed over the years, and the certification threshold goes by certification date. The template returns 0 if no sufficient certification date is provided or if there isn't a [[WP:RS|reliable source]] about the certification levels at the certification date.
* <code>discount</code> - set to <code>true</code> for discount albums in regions for which there is a different certification threshold for discount albums.
* <code>domestic</code> - set to <code>true</code> for domestic repertoire in regions for which there is a different certification threshold for domestic repertoire.
* <code>Spanish</code> - set to <code>true</code> for RIAA latin album certification.
* <code>digital</code> - set to <code>true</code> for digital download certification. Note that this is supported only in very specific cases, consult {{tl|Certification Table Entry}}. If you wish for this to be supported in any other region, please leave a note on the talk page.
* <code>multidisc</code> - the number of discs in a multidisc box, for regions in which these are certified multiple times. The template will divide by the number of discs to get the actual threshold in number of boxes sold. Note that this is supported only in very specific cases, consult {{tl|Certification Table Entry}}. If you wish for this to be supported in any other region, please leave a note on the talk page.
