== Usage ==

This template is intended for use within (Philippine) municipality or city infoboxes.  It emits a formatted {{tl|Collapsible list}} of Council members, together with footnote reference(s).  It allows inclusion too of 
* the designated local ABC chapter president, who is an ex officio council member
* the local SK chairman, also ex officio but whose position is under current review
* IP representative, also ex officio
* additional footnote.

==Parameters==

*Up to 40 member names are given as unnumbered parameters (municipality council comprises 8 members, city council can be 10 or more).
* {{para|abc}} which declares the ABC president
* {{para|sk}} which declares the SK chairman
* {{para|ip}} which declares the Indigenous People's representative
* {{para|extra}} which allows a footnote to be added

Note that the output order of these is fixed regardless of input order.
