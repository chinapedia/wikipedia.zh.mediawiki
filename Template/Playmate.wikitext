==Usage==
'''<nowiki>{{</nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}<nowiki>|2006|10}}</nowiki>''' will provide: {{playmate|2006|10}}
where the word "Playmate" is replaced with the model's name.

This is for use in the external links section of Playmate's articles.

Notes:
* The year of their centerfold should be the first value and the month should be the second. Single digit months need not have a leading zero. Thus January would be 1, not 01.
* If the article's name has a disambiguator in it such as Christine Smith (adult model) then a third value should be used which would be her name. i.e. <nowiki>{{playmate|2005|12|Christine Smith}}</nowiki> would yield {{playmate|2005|12|Christine Smith}}
