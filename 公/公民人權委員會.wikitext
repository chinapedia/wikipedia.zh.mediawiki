{{cite news|title=[ Fence Post ]|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Chicago Daily Herald|date=4 January 2001|format=Letters to the Editor|quote=Dangerous program / In a letter to Fence Post (Dec. 12), Susan Stozewski of the Chicago Church of Scientology attempts to promote a drug rehab program called Narconon. I wish to warn readers that Narconon is a front group for the Church of Scientology.  I found from personal experience that Narconon is a sham and is, in fact, a slick device to lure unsuspecting people into Scientology. An acquaintance of mine recently discovered that she had serious liver damage from Narconon's bogus "purification" program and she now cannot get health insurance coverage.  Another Scientology front group to beware of is the CCHR or Citizens Commission on Human Rights. The CCHR is using tax-exempt funds in a covert campaign to discredit psychiatric-psychology treatment. The CCHR has an extensive network of agents that are distributing distortions about psychiatric treatment and medications such as Prozac and Ritalin. This is a very dangerous thing and people should be aware that it is going on. / Jim Beebe / Northbrook}}</ref>

{{cite news|title=U.S. Food and Drug Administration rejects Scientologists' petition|accessdate=23 September 2012|newspaper=Business Wire (reprinting Eli Lilly press release)|date=1 August 1991|quote=The petition sought the removal of Prozac (fluoxetine hydrochloride, Dista) from the market and was filed in October 1990 by the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), a Scientology front group. The FDA is to be commended on its careful review of pertinent scientific data, which led to this most recent reaffirmation of the safety and effectiveness of Prozac.  From the start, the campaign against Prozac, of which the CCHR petition was a part, has been a dangerous deception. Scientology's disinformation is a menace to the public health as it attempts to frighten patients away from appropriate medical care and safe and effective medicines.}}</ref>

== 委員會對精神病的看法 ==
公民人權委員會對[[精神病學|精神病學]]的看法，直接反映了山達基創始人[[L·羅恩·賀伯特|L·羅恩·賀伯特]]的立場，其作品表達了非常強烈地反精神病學的觀點。根據賀伯特的認知， 所有[[精神科醫生|精神科醫生]]都是罪犯<ref>{{cite web | author=賀伯特, L·羅恩 | year=1969 | title=犯罪和精神病 | format= | work= | url=http://humanitarian.lronhubbard.org/psych2.htm | accessdate=2006-06-12 | language=en | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619143712/http://humanitarian.lronhubbard.org/psych2.htm | archivedate=2006-06-19 }}</ref>。

雖然公民人權委員會陳述其創會宗旨是“調查和揭露精神科違反人權”，但在山達基自己內部的募款出版物上，其目標是完全消除「精神疾病」這個詞彙，並請會員實現這一目標：「參加消除精神病的學隊」、「現在該是制止精神病學和它的犯罪行為的時候了」、「消除精神科醫生正是公民人權協會正在做的事！」。<ref>{{cite web
