McInnes joined West Bromwich Albion in the summer of 2000, but a [[cruciate_ligament|cruciate ligament]] injury ended his season in October. He returned the following season to captain West Brom to a place in the [[Premier_League|Premier League]]. He also won West Brom's Goal of the Season award at the end of the promotion campaign, for his 25-yard strike against [[Sheffield_United_F.C.|Sheffield United]] in the [[Battle_of_Bramall_Lane|Battle of Bramall Lane]].<ref>{{cite book | author = West Bromwich Albion Football Club | title = Official West Bromwich Albion Season Review 2001/02 | publisher = West Bromwich Albion Football Club | date = 2002 | pages = 226 & 237 | isbn = 0-9505585-7-5}}</ref>

McInnes was the first West Brom player to be sent off in the Premier League. He was dismissed in the second half of the club's first Premier League match against Manchester United at Old Trafford in August 2002.<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd vs WBA |url=http://www.wba.co.uk/page/MatchReport/0,,10366~17651,00.html |publisher=West Bromwich Albion F.C.|date=17 August 2002|accessdate=15 February 2010}}</ref> He played in the majority of West Brom's Premier League games during the 2002–03 season but was unable to prevent them from being relegated. He made 88 league appearances and scored six times for the [[West_Midlands_(county)|West Midlands]] club.

;登地聯
McInnes joined Dundee United on 11 July 2003, and was immediately installed as team captain by manager [[Ian_McCall|Ian McCall]]. In his first full season at [[Tannadice_Park|Tannadice]], McInnes missed only three league and one cup game. He helped the club to a 5th place finish in the [[Scottish_Premier_League|Scottish Premier League]] and scored twice — his first coming in the [[Scottish_Cup|Scottish Cup]] against [[Dunfermline_Athletic_F.C.|Dunfermline]] and his second in a league match against [[Heart_of_Midlothian_F.C.|Hearts]]. After an unsteady start to the [[2004-05_in_Scottish_football|2004–05 season]], McInnes began to take control again in the centre of midfield. He then picked up an injury with a third of the season remaining but managed to return to the first team for the Scottish Cup final at the end of the season.

In April 2006, United manager [[Craig_Brewster|Craig Brewster]] announced that McInnes was free to leave the club at the end of the season, despite having a year of his contract left to run.<ref>{{cite news
