'''德意志博物馆'''（{{lang-de|'''Deutsches Museum'''}}）是世界上最大的科技[[博物馆|博物馆]]，位于[[德国|德国]][[慕尼黑|慕尼黑]]，有50个科学技术领域的大约28,000件展品，每年有大约130万访问者。该博物馆开放于 1903年6月28日，Oskar von Miller召集了德国工程师学会（Verein Deutscher Ingenieure，VDI）会议。

德意志博物馆的主馆位于慕尼黑[[伊萨尔河|伊萨尔河]]的一个小岛上，该岛自中世纪起曾用作rafting wood ，在1772年以前，由于会定期被洪水淹没，岛上没有任何建筑物。 

1772年，在岛上修建了伊撒尔兵营。1899年洪水之后建筑物得到重建，增建了防洪设施。1903年，市议会宣布在该岛修建德意志博物馆。该岛的名称也由煤炭岛（Kohleinsel）更名为博物馆岛（Museumsinsel）。

德意志博物馆除了主馆以外，在慕尼黑附近和波昂还有两个分馆。波恩分馆开放于1995年，集中展示1945年以后德国的科学技术。德意志博物馆最新的一个分馆位于慕尼黑的Theresienhöhe，开放于2003年，展示交通技术。<!--Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum and is focused on 。

''Flugwerft Schleißheim'' branch is a 12.7 hectare site and includes additional flight air aeronautics exhibits. -->

The [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] electricity exhibition in 1891 and several power plants contributed to the reputation of Oskar von Miller. 
In the early years, the exhibition and the collection of the Deutsches Museum were strongly influenced personally by Oskar von Miller. -->
<!-- ==历史==
A few months prior to the summer 1903 meeting of the Society of German Engineers Oskar von Miller gathered a small group who supported his desire to found a science and technology museum. In a showing of support this group spontaneously donated 260,000 marks to the cause and elected a "Provisional Committee" to get the ball rolling. -->
<!-- In June of 1903 things really started coming together. Prince Ludwig agreed to act as patron of the museum and the city of Munich donated Coal Island as a site for the project. In addition exhibits begin to arrive from Munich, Germany and abroad including collections from the Bavarian Academy. As no dedicated museum building existed the exhibits were displayed in the National Museum.

1906年11月12日 the temporary exhibits at the National Museum are ceremonially opened to the public and on November 13 the foundation stone was laid for the permanent museum. 

该博物馆最初的名称是“German Museum for Masterpieces of 自然科学 and Technology", was not meant to limit the museum to German advances in science and technology, but to express the importance of science and technology to the German people.

Oskar von Miller opened the new museum on his seventieth birthday, 2 May, 1925 after a delay of almost ten years. From the beginning the museum displays are backed up by documents available in a 公共图书馆 and archives which are open seven days a week to ensure access to the working public. -->

<!-- followed by the congress hall in January 1946. A special exhibit on fifty years of the [[Diesel_engine|Diesel engine]] was able to open in October of 1947 and the regular exhibits began reopening in May 1948. Not until 1965, more than twenty years after the end of the war in Germany, did the exhibit area match (and then exceed) pre-war size.

During the 1950s the museum focused on natural sciences rather than technology and many of the traditional large exhibits, such as civil engineering, were reduced in size to make way for more modern technological advances.

In August of 1969 the [[Apollo_8|Apollo 8]] space capsule was shown in a special exhibit entitled "Man and Space" and in 1970 the first full-time director, Theo Stillger, was appointed. In the 1970s the mission statement of the museum was modified to encourage the explanation the cultural significance of science and technology in exhibits.

The early 1980s saw severe damage to several exhibits due to arson resulting in the smallest exhibit space of 34,140 square meters. This was followed by an extensive reconstruction effort and additional building bringing the total exhibit space to 55,000 square meters by 1993. The 1980s and 90s also brought agreements with the Science Center in Bonn and the government resulting in the creation of [[Deutsches_Museum_Bonn|Deutsches Museum Bonn]] and the  Flugwerft [[Schleißheim|Schleißheim]] airfield exhibit.

In 1996 the Bavarian Government gave buildings at the historic [[Theresienhöhe|Theresienhöhe]] site in Munich to the Deutsches Museum resulting in the creation of the new transportation museum, the Deutsches Museum Verkehrszentrum, which opened in 2003 and now houses the automobile and train exhibits which were removed from the original Deutsches Museum site. -->
