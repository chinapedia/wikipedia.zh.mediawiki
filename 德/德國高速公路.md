'''德國高速公路'''是[[德國|德國]]的全國[[高速公路|高速公路]]系統，其德文名称（{{lang|de|'''Autobahn'''}} {{IPA|[ˈaʊtoːbaːn]}} {{audio|De-Autobahn.ogg|德文發音}}）是“高速公路”的意思。被稱為{{lang|de|Autobahn}}的高速公路並不僅有德國的高速公路，[[瑞士|瑞士]]和[[奧地利|奧地利]]的高速公路也被稱為{{lang|de|Autobahn}}，但通常{{lang|de|Autobahn}}專指德國高速公路，其德文正式名稱為{{lang|de|'''Bundesautobahn'''}}（BAB，'''聯邦高速公路'''）。德國高速公路傳統上是沒有速度限制的，但是隨著車輛的增加，許多經過城鎮的路段都先後設立了速限，此外速度越快在意外訴訟中，駕駛人與陪同乘客所負擔的肇事責任也會顯著增加，保險也可能減少理賠額度。一份2008年的評論顯示，德國高速公路路網的52%無速限（有130km/h的[[建議速限|建議速限]]以節省油耗，調查顯示德國駕駛者一般保持時速約142km/h），剩下的15%會有因天氣（北方冬季會下雪）或交通狀況而設立的暫時速限，33%有永久速限，例如市區或山路等<ref>http://archive.etsc.eu/documents/Speed_Fact_Sheet_1.pdf</ref>。

== 興建時期 ==
[[File:Bundesautobahn_8_number.svg|100px]]
德國高速公路與世界上其他高速公路一樣，都是擁有多線道、雙向分離行駛、完全控制出入口、全部採用兩旁封閉和天橋與道口以及容許高速行駛的道路。第一條德國高速公路是在1932年建成，位於[[科隆|科隆]]與[[波恩|波恩]]之間。有些人以為這是高速路的起源，但更早的一條具有現代高速公路標準的公路，其實是在義大利已經鋪設的，也是高速公路真正的始祖<ref> [http://german.about.com/library/blgermyth08.htm German Myth 8 Hitler and the Autobahn] German.about.com</ref>。剛開始時的路面是以水泥構成的，在二次世界大戰後才逐漸的以[[瀝青|瀝青]]加以覆蓋。當初興建時的最高設計速度為大約每小時160公里，還有最大8%的横坡（路面横向的坡度），這在戰後修復時期更被改為4%，以確保駕駛人有更穩定的行車品質。

現在的公路編號系統是在1974年開始使用的，所有的高速公路都以A開頭後接一個空白與數字編號，例如：[[德国8号高速公路|A 8]]。穿越德國全國的東西向主要高速公路以偶數編號，南北向的道路則以單數編號。用來連接區域性重點城市的較短高速公路則以兩位數字來編號。

[[File:Autobahn_10-999.png|thumb]]

* A 10至A 19位於德國東部，包括[[柏林|柏林]]及[[薩克森-安哈特州|薩克森-安哈特州]]；

== 歷史 ==
[[File:Autobahn_Overhead_Sign.jpg|thumb]]


The idea for the construction of the Autobahn was first conceived during the days of the [[Weimar_Republic|Weimar Republic]], but apart from the [[AVUS|AVUS]] in [[Berlin|Berlin]], construction was slow, and most projected sections did not progress much beyond the planning stage due to economic problems and a lack of political support. One project was the private initiative ''HaFraBa'' which planned a "car only road" (the name ''autobahn'' was created in 1929) crossing Germany from [[Hamburg|Hamburg]] in the North via central [[Frankfurt_am_Main|Frankfurt am Main]] to [[Basel|Basel]] in [[Switzerland|Switzerland]]. Parts of the HaFraBa were completed in the 1930s and early 1940s, but construction eventually was halted by [[World_War_II|World War II]]. 
During the 1950s, the West German government restarted the construction program; it continuously invested in new sections and in improvements to older ones.  The finishing of the incomplete sections took longer, with some stretches being opened to traffic as late as the 1980s. Some sections cut by the [[Iron_Curtain|Iron Curtain]] in [[1945|1945]] were only completed after [[German_reunification|German reunification]] in [[1990|1990]]. Finally, certain sections were never completed, as more advantageous routes were found. Some of these sections stretch across the landscape forming a unique type of [[industrial_archaeology|modern ruin]], often easily visible on satellite photographs.

The autobahns in [[East_Germany|East Germany]] (GDR) and the former German provinces of [[East_Prussia|East Prussia]], eastern [[Pomerania|Pomerania]] and [[Silesia|Silesia]] in [[Poland|Poland]] and the [[Soviet_Union|Soviet Union]] after 1945 were grossly neglected in comparison to those in West Germany and Western Europe in general. They received minimal maintenance during the years of the [[Cold_War|Cold War]].  The speed limit on the GDR autobahns was 100 km/h (62 mph), however lower speed limits were frequently encountered due to the poor condition of the road surface, changing quickly in some instances.  The speed limits on the GDR autobahns were rigorously enforced by the [[Volkspolizei|Volkspolizei]], whose patrol cars were frequently encountered hiding under camouflage waiting for speeders.  In the 1970s and 80s, the West German government paid millions of [[Deutsche_Mark|Deutsche Mark]]s to the GDR for construction and maintenance of the transit autobahns between West Germany and [[West_Berlin|West Berlin]], although there were indications that the GDR diverted some of the earmarked maintenance funds for other purposes.

===Switzerland===
A short stretch of autobahn around the [[Lucerne|Lucerne]] area in 1955 created [[Switzerland|Switzerland]]'s first autobahn. For [[Expo|Expo]] 1964, an autobahn was built between [[Lausanne|Lausanne]] and [[Geneva|Geneva]]. The [[Bern|Bern]]-[[Lenzburg|Lenzburg]] route was inaugurated in 1967.

==Current density==
[[File:Autobahn_1-999.png|thumb]]
[[File:Autbahn_switzerland.png|thumb]]
Today, Germany's autobahn network has a total length of about 11,980 km (as of [[January_1|January 1]], 2003), third after the [[United_States|United States]]' [[Interstate_Highway|Interstate Highway System]] and the [[National_Trunk_Highway_System|National Trunk Highway System]] (NTHS) of the [[People's_Republic_of_China|People's Republic of China]]. 

The Swiss autobahn network has a total length of 1,638 km (as of 2000) and has, by an area of 41,290 km², also the one of the highest [[motorway|motorway]] densities in the world. The Swiss autobahn network has not yet been completed; priority has been given to the most important routes, especially the north-south and the west-east axis. The gaps in the autobahn network are apparent in the graphic.

===Germany===
Many sections of Germany's autobahns are modern, containing three lanes in addition to an emergency lane. Some other sections remain in their original state, with two lanes, no emergency lane, short ramps, etc. Such a combination of the two types of autobahn can be seen on the [[Bundesautobahn_9|A 9]] autobahn ([[Munich|Munich]]-[[Berlin|Berlin]]). Heading out from [[Munich|Munich]], the autobahn starts off as a modern, four lane in each direction + emergency lane autobahn. However, after heading into [[Thuringia|Thuringia]], which was formerly part of [[East_Germany|East Germany]], parts of the autobahn are no wider than two lanes and no emergency lane exists (only rare emergency bays with a telephone post in orange-yellow). Ongoing roadworks will eventually bring the entire A 9 to three-lane standard.  Another large project involves the extension of the A 6 at its eastern end to connect [[Nürnberg|Nürnberg]]/[[Amberg|Amberg]] with the Czech motorway D 5 running from Rozvadov to [[Prague|Prague]].

===Switzerland===
    Coincidentally, this very autobahn is constantly being repaired.
Swiss autobahns very often have an emergency lane except in tunnels. Some newly built autobahn sections, like the lone section crossing the [[Jura_mountains|Jura]] region in the north-western part of Switzerland, only have emergency bays. This may be due to the improved reliability of automobiles.

==Speed limits==
A hard limit is imposed on some vehicles:

{|
|-
!60 km/h (37 mph)
|
* Buses carrying standing passengers (except in Switzerland)
* Motorcycles pulling trailers (in Switzerland: 80 km/h)
|-
!80 km/h (50 mph)
|
* Vehicles with maximum allowed weight exceeding 3.5 t (except passenger cars)
* Passenger cars and trucks with trailers
* Buses (in Switzerland: 120 km/h)
|-
!100 km/h (62 mph)
|
* Passenger cars pulling trailers certified for 100 km/h
* Buses certified for 100 km/h not pulling trailers
|}

===Germany===
[[File:Zeichen_282.png|thumb]]
The German autobahns are famous for being some of the few public roads in the world without blanket [[speed_limit|speed limit]]s for cars and motorcycles. Lack of blanket speed limits does not appear to negatively impact the [[Road_safety#Motorway|road safety of autobahns]] compared with motorways in other countries; motorways are safer than other road types. Perhaps this is due in part because [[traffic|traffic]] can be heavy enough to restrict speeds to little above the typical motorway speeds found elsewhere.
      Another theory is that driving faster can increase concentration, leading to less accidents.
Certainly, speed limits do apply at junctions and other danger points, like sections under construction or in need of repair. Speed limits at non-construction sites are generally 100 km/h (62 mph), 120 km/h (75 mph), or sometimes even 130 km/h (81 mph); construction sites have a usual speed limit of 80 km/h (50 mph) but may be as low as 60 km/h (37 mph) or even 40 km/h (25 mph). Certain stretches have separate, and lower, speed limits used in cases of wet lanes. 

Some limits were imposed to reduce pollution and noise. Limits can also be put into place temporarily through dynamic traffic guidance systems that display the according traffic signs. If there is no speed limit, the recommended speed limit is 130 km/h (81 mph), referred to in German as the ''[[Richtgeschwindigkeit|Richtgeschwindigkeit]]''; this speed is not a binding limit, but being involved in an accident at higher speeds can lead to being deemed at least partially responsible due to "increased operating danger" (''Erhöhte Betriebsgefahr''). The average rate of speed traveled on the autobahn in unregulated ares by automobiles not regulated by other laws is about 150 Km/h (93 mph). On average, about half of the total length of the German autobahn network has no speed limit, about one third has a permanent limit, and the remaining parts have a temporary limit for a number of reasons.

In places without a general limit, there are mostly also no restrictions on overtaking. Therefore, those traveling at high speeds may often encounter trucks running side-by-side at only about 80 km/h (50 mph). In theory, trucks are not allowed to overtake others unless they drive 20 km/h (12 mph) faster than whomever they are overtaking, but truck drivers are generally under pressure to arrive in time, and such laws are rarely enforced for economic and political reasons, as many trucks are from foreign countries. On most days, the right lane of a typical autobahn is crowded with trucks, and too often, trucks pull out to overtake. Due to size and speed this is often referred to as 'Elefantenrennen' (Elephant Race).  In some zones with only two lanes in both directions there is no speed limit, but a special overtaking restriction for trucks and/or cars pulling trailers. (An exception is Sundays, on which trucks usually are not allowed to drive, except for trucks with perishable goods and certain other exceptions.)

Modern cars easily reach well over 200 km/h (124 mph), and most large car manufacturers follow a ''[[gentlemen's_agreement|gentlemen's agreement]]'' by artificially limiting the top speed of their cars to 250 km/h (155 mph) for safety reasons (inexperienced drivers and risk of [[tire|tire]]s failing, especially when underinflated). Yet, these limiters can easily be defeated, so speeds over 300 km/h (186 mph) are not uncommon. But due to common speed limits and other [[traffic|traffic]], such speeds are rarely attainable. Most unlimited sections of the autobahn are located in the south of Germany, where many of the large automobile production companies such as [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes-Benz]], [[Audi|Audi]], [[Porsche|Porsche]] and [[BMW|BMW]] reside. The [[Bundesautobahn_8|A 8]] at [[Stuttgart|Stuttgart]] is one such example.

Vehicles unable to attain speeds in excess of 60 km/h (37 mph) are not allowed to use the autobahn. Though this limit is not high for most modern vehicles, it prevents very small cars (e.g. [[All-terrain_vehicle|Quads]]) and motor-scooters (e.g. Mofas) from using autobahns. To comply with this limit, several heavy-duty trucks in Germany (e.g. for carrying tanks or cranes) have a design speed of 62 km/h (usually denoted by a round black-on-white sign with "62" on it).
=====Accident Record=====

The overall [[Road-traffic_safety#Motorway|safety record]] of autobahns is comparable to other European motorways and motorways are safer than other road types. A 2005 study by the Federal Minister of the Interior indicated there were an equal number of accidents per mile on the autobahn in sections without any speed limits. However, the same

==Toll requirements==
===Germany===
A recent development involves the introduction on [[January_1|January 1]], 2005 of mandatory tolls ''(Mautpflicht)'' for heavy trucks (weighing more than 12 metric tons) while using the German autobahn system.  The German government contracted with a private company, ''[[Toll_Collect|Toll Collect GmbH]]'', to operate the toll collection system, which involves the use of vehicle-mounted transponders and roadway-mounted sensors installed throughout Germany.  The introduction of this system experienced several technical delays resulting in the loss of millions of [[Euro|Euro]]s in potential revenue to the government.  One result of the new toll policy has been an increase in heavy truck traffic on regular highways (''Bundesstraßen'' and ''Landesstraßen'') in order to avoid paying tolls.  There have been recent discussions about extending the toll requirement to include passenger cars, however this has proven so far to be very unpopular with a majority of the public and politicians of the major parties have denied they are considering such measures.

===Austria and Switzerland===
Both the Swiss and Austrian autobahn systems require the purchase of a [[Vignette_(road_tax)|vignette]] (toll sticker) in order to use their respective roadways, for both passenger cars and trucks. 
But there is also the possibility of some routes where you have to pay an extra toll in case of  more expensive cost of preservation by the autobahn-company.
The Swiss vignette is offered only as an annual toll sticker, while the Austrians offer their vignettes in varying lengths of validity (10 days, 2 months or a year).
Since 2005 trucks have to have a Go-Box, a little white box which counts the length of the used autobahn with electrical control points. In Austria the Go-Box is queried by overhead [[DSRC|DSRC]] microwave radio transceivers at each exit. As only trucks need to carry a Go-Box, overhead 3-D infrared laser scanners are used to detect and photograph trucks without Go-Box.

==交通規則以及執法=
德國高速公路網路由配有攝影機的便衣警車進行巡邏; 執法透過錄影蒐證的方式舉發(例如：跟車太近). 
值得關注的法規包含以下幾條:
* 外側車道暢通無阻時必須使用,內側車道僅供超車;用路人在外側車道無車的情況下使用內側車道過久,會被高速公路警察罰款.
* 用閃大燈或跟車太近的方式迫使內側較慢車輛到外側可能會犯法.
* 嚴禁外側車道超車, 但是嚴重塞車時可以考慮但需要提高警覺. 若塞車,車流速度低於20公里/小時,甚至定點,可用外側車道超車,速限60公里/小時.這個不稱為"超車",稱為"從旁邊開過去".事實上違法,但說左側車道用路人違法佔用超車道過久的理由交通仲裁時將不被接受,這種情形警察會處罰兩造用路人.無論如何,有時還是會有一些例外.
* 奧地利與德國的高速公路僅提供在設計上最高速度能夠超過時速60公里/小時（瑞士:80公里/小時）以上的動力車輛使用.
* 塞車的狀下,用路人需要開出一條路,確保緊急車輛能夠到達事故現場.這條路線必須在內側車道跟次內側車道之間.
* 除了緊急事故或不可避免的因素(像是塞車或者意外),任何理由停下來都視作違法.這個包含了停在外側緊急車道.車輛沒有油料而顧路是可以事先避免的,所以要罰. 某些情況下, (危及身家性命財安全,例如車輛或高速公路設施)可能被視為犯罪,而且駕駛人可拘役最高五年.
* 在德國有救人的一般性義務.如果有事故,可能的話,駕駛人要停下來幫忙.
* 在德國,參加過緊急救護訓練才能取得駕照.
* 2006年五月起跟車的罰單增加了.時速超過100公里/小時, 保持低於30%的建議車距,現在會扣照1-3個月. 所以右側超車跟緊急車道超車罰則還不比高速跟車. 外籍的駕駛當場開罰, 國籍駕照當場沒收,車輛租用約定當場取消.
* 由於法律規定(Straßenverkehrsordnung) 允許閃車頭燈 (Lichthupe) 以告知超車的意圖, 但仍要和前車保持適當距離. 與前車未保持安全距離又閃車頭燈是違法的.駕駛會因為Nötigung (coercion)受罰.
* 車胎必須是證明通過該車最高速的測試(冬季輪胎 (泥巴 + 雪)會低一些. (比高速胎稍微便宜一點的廉價胎)也是允許的, 駕駛座必須有一張貼紙提示最大速度).
* 冬季月份,冬天用輪胎是強制必需的. M+S ((泥巴 + 雪)胎 or 全年通用的輪胎) 是可以接受的. 用不合法的輪胎,一旦肇事,除了可能要面對法律責任,還要牽涉到保險理賠的問題.


[[File:Zeichen_620_rechts.png|right]]

* The distance to the vehicle in front (in meters) should be at least half the speed (in km/h) at all times (e.g. at least 60 meters at 120 km/h).  This corresponds to a "lead time" of just under 2 seconds. As a reference: The white-and-black reflection posts to the right have a distance of 50 m to each other. Again, the fact that the car in front is illegally occupying the left-hand lane when the right-hand lane is free does not excuse following too close.
*:Fines for [[tailgating|tailgating]] have been increased in May 2006. At speeds over 100 km/h, keeping less than 30 percent of the recommended distance now results in a suspension of one's driver's license for one to three months.
* Due to legal regulations (''Straßenverkehrsordnung'') it is allowed to flash headlights (''Lichthupe'') in order to indicate the intention of overtaking, but a proper distance to the vehicle in front must be obtained. Driving at insufficient distances and flashing headlights is illegal.
* The tires must be approved for the vehicle's top speed (winter tires (mud + snow) for lower speeds (i.e. cheaper than high-speed tires) are allowed, the driver has to have a sticker in the cockpit reminding of the maximum speed).

== 基本駕駛原則 ==
* 盡可能靠右側行駛。
* 左側超車。
上述原則產生之結果：左側車永遠比右側車快，佔據左側超車道者禮讓。

== 收費 ==
德國高速公路原則上不收費。2005年1月開始，對重量超過12噸的貨車開始收費，平均每公里收15歐分的使用費。因為重量太重的大車，對公路損害程度較大，對環境的污染也較大，應該承擔一些公路的維護費用及環保成本。這種作法可刺激運輸公司換用更小的貨車，以降低對公路的損害及提升對環境的保護，降低汙染<ref>[http://photo.chinatimes.com/20150723004956-260804 《別人家的高速公路怎麼收費？》]</ref>。而對歐盟與國外的駕駛人而言，德國部分政治家曾提出建議，考慮對外國使用者採用不同的收費方案，因為德國高速公路的維護費用驚人卻主要是由德國人納稅負擔，但目前處於爭辯而尚未實施。
