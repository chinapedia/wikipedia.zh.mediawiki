'''非已然語氣'''（{{lang|en|irrealis moods}}、[[縮寫|縮寫]] {{lang|en|IRR}}、非現實式/非實現狀/非實然/未來式）為[[语气|语气]]的主要集合體，表明了說話人在說話時某種情況或動作不知道已經發生。與此相反，稱之為[[已然語氣|已然語氣]]。<ref>蕭惠帆(Hsiao Hui-Fan),"5.2 實然--非實然與時--位的概念/從語法到教學論詞彙來去的趨向和情態（The Modality of lai and qu 'come/go' in Mandarin Chinese）"[http://etds.lib.ntnu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/gs/ntnugsweb.cgi?o=dntnucdr&i=sid=%2292NTNU0612010%22.],碩士論文[<small>92NTNU0612010</small>],臺灣師範大學,2003,ch5:p.7-9.</ref>

每一種語言都有"非現實式"的語式。西北太平洋地區的原住民語言有多達五個層次的"非現實式"(unreality)。

==主要非已然語氣==
===假設語氣===
{{main|假設語氣}}

[[英語|英語]]範例: "{{lang|en|If I loved you...}}(如果我愛你...)" / "{{lang|en|May I love you}}(我可以愛你嗎)"

'''假設語氣'''，有時也被稱為'''連接語氣'''(conjunctive mood)，在[[從屬子句|從屬子句]](dependent clause)裡有幾種用法。例子包括討論到假設的或不可能的事件，表達意見或情感，或則表現禮貌的請求(確切的範圍是特定的語言)。一種假設語氣存在於英語，但它往往不是強制性的。例如："{{lang|en|I suggested that Paul eat an apple}}(我認為保羅吃一個蘋果)", Paul is not in fact eating an apple.(保羅其實也不是吃一個蘋果)。對比這一句"{{lang|en|Paul eats an apple.}}(保羅吃一個蘋果)"，其中動詞"to eat(吃)"為現在式，直陳語氣(indicative mood)。另一種方式，尤其是在[[英國英語|英國英語]]中，表達了這句可能為 "{{lang|en|I suggested that Paul should eat an apple.}}(我認為保羅應該吃一個蘋果)"”，源於"Paul should eat an apple.(保羅應該吃一個蘋果)。 

在英語中虛擬語氣的其他用法，例如"{{lang|en|And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his trespass...}}(如果他不能夠獻一隻羊，因而為他的罪他就要獻...)"([[钦定版圣经|钦定版圣经]][[利未記|利未記]]5:7)，已經成為過時的用法。有一些語句比如"{{lang|en|I shall ensure that he leave immediately.}}(我要確保他立即離開)"通常聽起來過於正式，而且往往已經被直陳語氣結構所取代，諸如"{{lang|en|I'll make sure [that] he leave'''s''' immediately.}}(我會確保[是]他立即離開)"。
<!--
The subjunctive mood figures prominently in the [[grammar|grammar]] of the [[Romance_languages|Romance languages]], which require this mood for certain types of dependent clauses. This point commonly causes difficulty for English speakers learning these languages.

In certain other languages, the dubitative or the conditional moods may be employed instead of the subjunctive in referring to doubtful or unlikely events (see the main article).-->

===條件語氣===
{{main|條件語氣}}

英語範例: "I would love you.(我會愛你)"
<!--
The '''conditional mood''' ([[list_of_glossing_abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''cond'''}}) is used to speak of an event whose realization is dependent upon another condition, particularly, but not exclusively, in [[conditional_sentence|conditional sentence]]s. In Modern English, it is a [[periphrasis|periphrastic construction]], with the form ''would'' + infinitive, e.g. ''I would buy''. In other languages, such as Spanish or French, verbs have a specific conditional [[inflection|inflection]]. This applies also to some verbs in German, in which the conditional mood is conventionally called ''Konjunktiv II'', differing from ''Konjunktiv I''. Thus, the conditional version of "John eats if he is hungry" is:

: ''John '''would eat''' if he were hungry'', in English;
: ''Johannes '''äße''', wenn er Hunger hätte'', in German;
: ''Jean '''mangerait''' s'il avait faim'', in French;
: ''Juan '''comería''' si tuviera hambre'', in Spanish.
: ''Giovanni '''mangerebbe''' se avesse fame'', in Italian;

''Johannes '''würde essen''', wenn er Hunger hätte'' is also acceptable in German.

In the [[Romance_languages|Romance languages]], the conditional form is used primarily in the [[Conditional_sentence|apodosis]] (main clause) of conditional clauses, and in a few [[set_phrase|set phrase]]s where it expresses courtesy or doubt. The main verb in the [[Protasis_(linguistics)|protasis]] (dependent clause) is either in the subjunctive or in the indicative mood. However, this is not a universal trait: among others in German (as above) and in [[Finnish_language|Finnish]] the conditional mood is used in both the apodosis and the protasis. A further example is the sentence "I would buy a house if I earned a lot of money", where in Finnish both clauses have the conditional marker ''-isi-'': ''Osta'''isi'''n talon, jos ansaits'''isi'''n paljon rahaa''. In Polish the conditional marker ''-by'' also appears twice: ''Kupił'''by'''m dom, gdy'''by'''m zarabiał dużo pieniędzy''. Because English is used as a lingua franca, a similar kind of doubling of the word ''would'' is a fairly common way to misuse an English language construction.

In English, too, the ''would'' + infinitive construct can be employed in main clauses, with a [[subjunctive_mood|subjunctive]] sense: "If you '''would''' only '''tell me''' what is troubling you, I might be able to help".

=== Optative ===
{{main|Optative mood}}
The '''optative mood''' expresses hopes, wishes or commands and has other uses that may overlap with the subjunctive mood. Few languages have an optative as a distinct mood; some that do are [[Albanian_language|Albanian]], Ancient [[Greek_language|Greek]], [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit]], [[Finnish_language|Finnish]], as well as [[Avestan|Avestan]], [[Old_Persian|Old Persian]], [[Middle_Persian|Middle Persian]], and [[New_Persian|New Persian]].

In Finnish, the mood may be called an "archaic" or "formal imperative", even if it has other uses; nevertheless, it does express formality at least. For example, the ninth Article of the [[Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights|Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] begins with ''Älköön ketään pidätettäkö mielivaltaisesti'', "'''Not''' anyone '''shall be arrested''' arbitrarily", where ''älköön pidätettäkö'' "shall not be arrested" is the optative of ''ei pidätetä'' "is not arrested". (Also, using the conditional mood ''-isi-'' in conjunction with the clitic ''-pa'' yields an optative meaning, e.g. ''olisinpa'' "if I only were". Here, it is evident that the wish is not, and probably will not be fulfilled.)

In Sanskrit, the optative is formed by adding the secondary endings to the verb stem. The optative, as other moods, is found in active voice and middle voice. Examples: ''bhares'' "may you bear" (active) and ''bharethaas'' "may you bear [for yourself]" (middle). The optative may not only express wishes, requests and commands, but also possibilities, e.g. ''kadaacid goshabdena budhyeta'' "he might perhaps wake up due to the bellowing of cows".,<ref>Gonda, J., 1966. A concise elementary grammar of the Sanskrit language with exercises, reading selections, and a glossary. Leiden, E.J. Brill.</ref> doubt and uncertainty, e.g. ''katham vidyaam Nalam'' "how would I be able to recognize Nala?" The optative may further be used instead of a [[conditional_mood|conditional mood]].

=== Jussive ===
{{main|Jussive mood}}
The '''jussive mood''' ([[list_of_glossing_abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''jus'''}}) expresses plea, insistence, imploring, self-encouragement, wish, desire, intent, command, purpose or consequence. In some languages, this is distinguished from the cohortative mood in that the cohortative occurs in the first person and the jussive in the second or third. It is found in [[Arabic_language|Arabic]], where it is called the '''مجزوم'''  ''majzūm''. The [[ʾIʿrab#Verbs|rules governing the jussive]] in Arabic are somewhat complex.

===Potential===
The '''potential mood''' ([[list_of_glossing_abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''pot'''}}) is a mood of probability indicating that, in the opinion of the speaker, the action or occurrence is considered likely. It is used in many languages, including in [[Latin|Latin]], [[Persian_language|Persian]], [[Finnish_language|Finnish]], [[Japanese_language|Japanese]], in [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] and in the [[Sami_languages|Sami languages]].  (In Japanese it is often called something like '''tentative,''' since '''potential''' is used to refer to a [[grammatical_voice|voice]] indicating capability to perform the action.)

In Finnish, it is mostly a literary device, as it has virtually disappeared from daily spoken language in most dialects. Its suffix is ''-ne-'', as in *''men'' + ''ne'' + ''e'' → ''mennee''  "(s/he/it) will probably go". Some kinds of consonant clusters simplify to [[Gemination|geminates]]. This simplification occurs progressively (*''rne → rre'') with the resonant consonants ''l'', ''r'', and ''s'', and regressively with stops (*''tne → nne'') and is meant to prevent the violation of [[Phonotactics|phonotactical]] rules concerning [[sonority_hierarchy|sonority hierarchy]]. For example, ''korjata'' → *''korjat'' + ''ne'' + ''t'' → ''korjannet'' "you will probably fix", or ''tulla'' → *''tul'' + ''ne'' + ''e'' → ''tullee'' "s/he/it will probably come". The potential mood can be used only in present and perfect tenses. The verb ''ole-'' "be" is replaced by ''lie'', so that "(it) is probably" is ''lienee'' (not *''ollee''). Thus, in the perfect tense, which is formed with an auxiliary verb, the auxiliary verb ''lie'' is used instead of ''ole-'' as ''liene-'', e.g. ''lienet korjannut'' "you have probably fixed" (not *''ollet korjannut''). In spoken language, the word ''kai'' "probably" is used instead, e.g. ''se kai tulee'' "he probably comes", instead of ''hän tullee''.

=== Imperative===
{{main|Imperative mood}}

The '''imperative mood''' expresses direct commands, requests, and prohibitions. In many circumstances, using the imperative mood may sound blunt or even rude, so it is often used with care. Example: "Paul, do your homework now".  An imperative is used to tell someone to do something without argument.

Many languages, including English, use the bare verb stem to form the imperative (such as "go", "run", "do").  Other languages, such as [[Seri_language|Seri]] and [[Latin|Latin]], however, use special imperative forms. 

In English, second person is implied by the imperative except when first-person plural is specified, as in "Let's go" ("Let us go").

The prohibitive mood, the negative imperative may be grammatically or morphologically different from the imperative mood in some languages. It indicates that the action of the verb is not permitted, e.g. "Do not go!" (archaically, "Go not!")

In English, the imperative is sometimes used to form a [[conditional_sentence|conditional sentence]]: e.g. "Go eastwards a mile, and you will see it" means "If you go eastward a mile, you will see it".

== Less common irrealis moods ==
=== Desiderative ===
{{main|Desiderative mood}}
Whereas the optative expresses hopes, the '''desiderative mood''' expresses  wishes and desires. Desires are what we want to be the case; hope generally implies optimism toward the chances of a desire's fulfillment. If someone desires something but is pessimistic about its chances of occurring, then one desires it but does not hope for it. Few languages have a distinct desiderative mood; two that do are [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit]] and [[Japanese_language|Japanese]].

In Japanese the verb inflection ''-tai'' expresses the speaker's desire, e.g. ''watashi wa asoko ni ikitai'' "I want to go there". This form is treated as a pseudo-adjective: the auxiliary verb ''garu'' is used by dropping the end ''-i'' of an adjective to indicate the outward appearance of another's mental state, in this case the desire of a person other than the speaker (e.g. ''Jon wa tabetagatte imasu'' "John wants to eat").

In Sanskrit, the infix -''sa''-, sometimes -''isa''-, is added to the replicated root, e.g. ''jijiivishati'' "he wants to live" instead of ''jivati'' "he lives".<ref>Van Der Geer, AAE. 1995. ''Samskrtabhasa B1, cursus Sanskrit voor beginners'' and  ''Samskrtabhasa B2, cursus Sanskrit voor gevorderden''. Leiden: Talen Instituut Console</ref> The desiderative in Sanskrit may also be used as imminent: ''mumuurshati'' "he is about to die".

===Dubitative===
{{main|Dubitative mood}}
The '''dubitative mood''' is used in [[Ojibwe_language|Ojibwe]], [[Turkish_language|Turkish]], and other languages.  It expresses the speaker's doubt or uncertainty about the event denoted by the verb. For example, in Ojibwe, ''Baawitigong igo ayaa noongom'' translates as "he is in [[California|California]] today." When the dubitative suffix ''-dog'' is added, this becomes ''Baawitigong igo ayaa'''dog''' noongom'', "I guess he must be in California.<ref>[http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/document/curricul/ojibwe.pdf Ontario Curriculum Support Document for the Teaching of Language Patterns]</ref>

===Hypothetical===
{{main|Hypothetical mood}}

E.g.: "I could love you [if...]"

The '''hypothetical mood''', found in [[Russian_language|Russian]], [[Lakota_language|Lakota]], and other languages, expresses a [[counterfactual_conditional|counterfactual]] but possible event or situation.

===Presumptive===
E.g.: There is no exact English example, although it could be translated as: "[Even] If I loved you [...]"

The '''presumptive mood''' is used in [[Romanian_language|Romanian]] to express presupposition or hypothesis, regardless of the fact denoted by the verb, as well as other more or less similar attitudes: doubt, curiosity, concern, condition, indifference, inevitability. For example, ''acolo s-o fi dus'' "he might have gone there" shows the basic presupposition use, while the following excerpt from a poem by [[Eminescu|Eminescu]] shows the use both in a conditional clause ''de-o fi'' "suppose it is" and in a main clause showing an attitude of submission to fate ''le-om duce'' "we would bear".

: ''De-o fi una, de-o fi alta... Ce e scris și pentru noi,''
: ''Bucuroși le-om duce toate, de e pace, de-i război.''

: Be it one, be it the other... Whatever fate we have,
: We will gladly go through all, be it peace or be it war

=== Permissive ===
{{main|Permissive mood}}

The '''permissive mood''' indicates that the action is permitted by the speaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/linguistics/GlossaryOflinguisticTerms/WhatIsPermissiveMood.htm|title=What is permissive mood?|publisher=SIL International|work=Glossary of linguistic terms|last=Loos|first=Eugene E.|coauthors=Susan Anderson; Dwight H. Day, Jr.; Paul C. Jordan; J. Douglas Wingate|accessdate=2009-12-28}}</ref>

===Admirative===
{{see also|Mirative}}
The '''admirative mood''' ([[list_of_glossing_abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''mir'''}}) is used to express surprise, but also doubt, irony, sarcasm, etc. In Indo-European languages, the admirative, unlike the optative, is not one of the original moods, but a later development. Admirative constructs occur in Balkan Slavic (Bulgarian and Macedonian), [[Tosk_Albanian|Tosk Albanian]], and [[Megleno-Romanian|Megleno-Romanian]]. A form of the admirative, derived from the Albanian pattern, can be found in Frasheriote Arumanian.

===Hortative===
{{main|Hortative}}
The '''hortative mood''' (alternatively, "hortatory") is used to express plea, insistence, imploring, self-encouragement, wish, desire, intent, command, purpose or consequence. It does not exist in English, but phrases such as "let us" are often used to denote it. In Latin, it is interchangeable with the jussive.

===Eventive===
The '''eventive mood''' is used in the [[Finnish_language|Finnish]] epic poem ''[[Kalevala|Kalevala]]''. It is a combination of the potential and the conditional. It is also used in dialects of [[Estonian_language|Estonian]]. In Finnish, there are theoretically forms such as ''kävelleisin'' "I would probably walk".

=== Precative ===
E.g.: "Will you love me?"

'''Precative''' ([[list_of_glossing_abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''prec'''}}) mood is a grammatical mood which signifies requests, e.g. "Will you pass me the salt?"

=== Volitive ===
{{main|volitive modality}}
The '''volitive mood''' ([[list_of_glossing_abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''vol'''}}) is used to indicate the speaker's desires, wishes, or fears.

=== Inferential or renarrative===
{{main|Inferential mood}}

The '''inferential mood''' ([[list_of_glossing_abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''infer'''}} or {{sc|'''infr'''}}) is used to report a nonwitnessed event without confirming it, but the same forms also function as admiratives in the [[Balkan|Balkan]] languages in which they occur. The '''inferential mood''' is used in some languages such as [[Turkish_language|Turkish]] to convey information about events that were not directly observed or were inferred by the speaker. When referring to [[Bulgarian_language|Bulgarian]] and other Balkan languages, it is often called '''renarrative mood'''; when referring to [[Estonian_language|Estonian]], it is called '''oblique mood'''. The inferential is usually impossible to be distinguishably translated into English. For instance, indicative Bulgarian той отиде (''toy otide'') and Turkish ''o gitti'' will be translated the same as inferential той отишъл (''toy otishal'') and ''o gitmiş'' — with the English indicative ''he went''.'''<ref>For a more precise rendering, it would be possible to also translate these as "he reportedly went" or "he is said to have gone" (or even "apparently, he went") although, clearly, these long constructions would be impractical in an entire text composed in this tense.</ref>''' Using the first pair, however, implies very strongly that the speaker either witnessed the event or is very sure that it took place. The second pair implies either that the speaker did not in fact witness it take place, that it occurred in the remote past or that there is considerable doubt as to whether it actually happened. If it were necessary to make the distinction, then the English constructions "he must have gone" or "he is said to have gone" would partly translate the inferential.

=== Interrogative ===
{{main|Interrogative mood}}
The '''interrogative mood''' ([[list_of_glossing_abbreviations|abbreviated]] {{sc|'''int'''}}) is used for asking questions. Most languages do not have a special mood for asking questions, but [[Welsh_language|Welsh]] and [[Nenets_languages|Nenets]] do.-->
