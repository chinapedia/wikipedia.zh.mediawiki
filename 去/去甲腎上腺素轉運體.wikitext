==Gene==

The norepinephrine transporter gene, SLC6A2 is located on human [[16號染色體|chromosome 16]] locus 16q12.2. This gene is encoded by 14 [[外显子|exon]]s.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> Based on the nucleotide and amino acid sequence, the NET transporter consists of 617 amino acids with 12 membrane-spanning domains. The structural organization of NET is highly homologous to other members of a sodium/chloride-dependent family of neurotransmitter transporters, including dopamine, epinephrine, [[血清素|serotonin]] and {{tsl|en|GABA transporter 1||GABA transporters}}.<ref name="pmid14987367"/>

=== Single nucleotide polymorphisms ===
A [[單核苷酸多態性|single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) is a genetic variation in which a genome sequence is altered by a single nucleotide ([[腺嘌呤|A]], [[胸腺嘧啶|T]], [[胞嘧啶|C]] or [[鳥嘌呤|G]]). NET proteins with an altered amino acid sequence (more specifically, a {{tsl|en|missense mutation||missense mutation}}) could potentially be associated with various diseases that involve abnormally high or low plasma levels of [[去甲肾上腺素|norepinephrine]] due to altered NET function.

== Function ==

NET functions to transport synaptically released [[去甲肾上腺素|norepinephrine]] back into the presynaptic neuron. As much as 90% of the norepinephrine released will be taken back up in the cell by NET. NET functions by coupling the influx of sodium and chloride (Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>−</sup>) with the transport of norepinephrine. This occurs at a fixed ratio of 1:1:1.<ref name="Galli">{{cite journal | vauthors = Galli A, DeFelice LJ, Duke BJ, Moore KR, Blakely RD | title = Sodium-dependent norepinephrine-induced currents in norepinephrine-transporter-transfected HEK-293 cells blocked by cocaine and antidepressants | url = https://archive.org/details/sim_journal-of-experimental-biology_1995-10_198_10/page/2197 | journal = The Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 198 | issue = Pt 10 | pages = 2197–212 | date = Oct 1995 | pmid = 7500004 | doi =  }}</ref> Both  the NET and  the {{tsl|en|dopamine transporter||dopamine transporter}} (DAT) can transport norepinephrine and dopamine.

[[File:Norepinephrine_structure.svg|thumb]]
Norepinephrine (NE) is released from [[去甲肾上腺素|noradrenergic]] neurons that innervate both the [[中樞神經系統|CNS]] and [[周围神经系统|PNS]]. NE, also known as noradrenaline (NA), has an important role in controlling mood, arousal, memory, learning, and pain perception. NE is a part of the [[交感神经|sympathetic nervous system]].<ref name=Schroeter /><ref name="pmid16871320">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhou J | title = Norepinephrine transporter inhibitors and their therapeutic potential | journal = Drugs of the Future | volume = 29 | issue = 12 | pages = 1235–1244 | date = Dec 2004 | pmid = 16871320 | pmc = 1518795 | doi = 10.1358/dof.2004.029.12.855246 }}</ref> Dysregulation of the removal of norepinephrine by NET is associated with many neuropsychiatric diseases, discussed below . In addition, many antidepressants and recreational drugs compete for the binding of NET with NE.<ref name=Stober />

== Transport mechanisms ==

The transport of norepinephrine back into presynaptic cell is made possible by the cotransport with Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup>. The sequential binding of the ions results in the eventual reuptake of norepinephrine. The ion gradients of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> make this reuptake energetically favorable. The gradient is generated by the [[鈉鉀泵|Na+/K+-ATPase]] which transports three sodium ions out and two potassium ions into the cell.<ref name=Torres /> NETs have conductances similar to those of {{tsl|en|ligand-gated ion channel||ligand-gated ion channel}}s. The expression of NET results in a leak-channel activity.<ref name=Galli /><ref name=Torres />

== Location in the nervous system ==

NETs are restricted to [[去甲肾上腺素|noradrenergic]] neurons and are not present on neurons that release dopamine or epinephrine.<ref name=Schroeter /><ref name=Sager /><ref name=Torres />  The transporters can be found along the cell body, [[轴突|axon]]s, and [[树突|dendrite]]s of the neuron.<ref name=Schroeter /> NETs are located away from the synapse, where norepinephrine is released. They are found closer to the plasma membrane of the cell. This requires norepinephrine to diffuse from the site it is released to the transporter for reuptake.<ref name=Torres /> Norepinephrine transporters are confined to the neurons of the sympathetic system, and those innervating the adrenal medulla, lung, and placenta.<ref name=Torres />

==Regulation==

Regulation of NET function is complex and a focus of current research. NETs are regulated at both the cellular and molecular level post-translation. The most understood mechanisms include phosphorylation by the second messenger [[蛋白激酶C|protein kinase C]] (PKC).<ref name=Sager />  PKC has been shown to inhibit NET function by sequestration of the transporter from the plasma membrane.<ref name="Gether">{{cite journal | vauthors = Gether U, Andersen PH, Larsson OM, Schousboe A | title = Neurotransmitter transporters: molecular function of important drug targets | journal = Trends in Pharmacological Sciences | volume = 27 | issue = 7 | pages = 375–83 | date = Jul 2006 | pmid = 16762425 | doi = 10.1016/j.tips.2006.05.003 }}</ref> The amino acid sequence of NET has shown multiple sites related to protein kinase phosphorylation.<ref name=Torres /> Post-translational modifications can have a wide range of effects on the function of the NET, including the rate of fusion of NET-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane, and transporter turnover.<ref name=Gether />

== Clinical significance ==

=== Orthostatic intolerance ===
{{Main|Orthostatic intolerance}}
Orthostatic intolerance (OI) is a disorder of the [[自主神经系统|autonomic nervous system]] (a subcategory of [[自主神经紊乱|dysautonomia]]) characterized by the onset of symptoms upon standing. Symptoms include fatigue, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, increased heart rate/[[心悸|heart palpitations]], anxiety, and altered vision.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> Often, patients have high plasma [[去甲肾上腺素|norepinephrine]] (NE) concentrations (at least 600 pg/ml) in relation to sympathetic outflow upon standing, suggesting OI is a hyper{{tsl|en|adrenergic||adrenergic}} condition.<ref name="pmid14987367"/><ref name="pmid10684912"/>
The discovery of identical twin sisters both suffering from OI suggested a genetic basis for the disorder.<ref name="pmid14987367"/><ref name="pmid10684912"/> A {{tsl|en|missense mutation||missense mutation}} on the NET gene (SLC62A) was discovered in which an [[丙氨酸|alanine]] residue was replaced with a [[脯氨酸|proline]] residue (Ala457Pro) in a highly conserved region of the transporter.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> The patients’ defective NET had only 2% of the activity of the [[野生型|wild-type]] version of the gene.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> The genetic defect in the NET protein results in decreased NET activity that could account for abnormally high NE plasma levels in OI. However, 40 other OI patients did not have the same missense mutation, indicating other factors contributed to the phenotype in the identical twins.<ref name="pmid14987367"/> This discovery of the linkage with NET mutations that results in decreased norepinephrine {{tsl|en|reuptake||reuptake}} activity and orthostatic intolerance suggests faulty NE uptake mechanisms can contribute to cardiovascular disease.<ref name="pmid11804991">{{cite journal | vauthors = Schroeder C, Tank J, Boschmann M, Diedrich A, Sharma AM, Biaggioni I, Luft FC, Jordan J | title = Selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibition as a human model of orthostatic intolerance | journal = Circulation | volume = 105 | issue = 3 | pages = 347–53 | date = Jan 2002 | pmid = 11804991 | doi = 10.1161/hc0302.102597 }}</ref>

== Therapeutic uses ==

Inhibition of the norepinephrine transporter (NET) has potential therapeutic applicationsin the treatment of  [[注意力不足過動症|attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD), [[物質濫用|substance abuse]], neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., [[阿兹海默病|Alzheimer's disease]] (AD) and [[帕金森氏症|Parkinson's disease]] (PD)) and [[重性抑郁障碍|clinical depression]].<ref name="pmid16871320"/>

== Further research ==
The role of the NET in many brain disorders underlies the importance of understanding the (dys)regulation of the transporter. A complete model of the proteins that associate with the transporter will be useful in designing drug therapies for diseases such as [[精神分裂症|schizophrenia]], [[情感障礙|affective disorder]], and autonomic disorders. Recently discovered mechanisms of the NET, including the ability to act reversibly and as an ion channel, provide other areas of research.<ref name=Sager /><ref name=Torres />

The role of NE in [[精神分裂症|schizophrenia]] has not been fully understood, but has stimulated research into this topic.<ref name = "Decaire">{{Cite web
