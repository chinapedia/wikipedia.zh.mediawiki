'''社会人格学'''（[[英語|英語]]：Socionics）是一种1970年诞生，将人格分为16种类型的[[心理学|心理学]]理论。此理论可以帮助预测人与人之间的关系<ref name=blunter2010>{{cite journal |author=Blutner R., Hochnadel E. |title=Two qubits for C.G. Jung’s theory of personality |journal=Cognitive Systems Research |year=2010 |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=243-259 |url=http://blutner.de/Documents/Jung_rev.pdf |access-date=2015-07-30 |archive-date=2015-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715070310/http://blutner.de/Documents/Jung_rev.pdf |dead-url=no }}<blockquote>"Socionics was developed in the 1970s and 1980s mainly by the Lithuanian researcher Ausˇra Augustinavicˇiute. The name ‘socionics’ is derived from the word ‘society, since Augustinavicˇiute believed that each personality type has a distinct purpose in society, which can be described and explained by socionics. The system of socionics is in several respects similar to the MBTI; however, whereas the latter is dominantly used in the USA and Western Europe, the former is mainly used in Russia and Eastern Europe. For more information, the reader is referred to the website of the International Institute of Socionics and to several scientific journals edited by this institution（see http://socionic.info/en/esocjur.html#top） {{Wayback|url=http://socionic.info/en/esocjur.html#top） |date=20150722000516 }}. Despite of several similarities there are also important
differences. For instance, the MBTI is based on questionnaires with so-called forced-choice questions. Forcedchoice means that the individual has to choose only one of two possible answers to each question. Obviously, such tests are self-referential. That means they are based on judgments of persons about themselves. Socionics rejects the use of such questionnaires and is based on interviews and direct observation of certain aspects of human behavior instead. However, if personality tests are well constructed and their questions are answered properly, we expect results that often make sense. For that reason, we do not reject test questions principally, but we have to take into account their self-referential character. Another difference relates to the fact that socionics tries to understand Jung’s intuitive system and to provide a deeper explanation for it, mainly in terms of informational metabolism（Kepinski & PZWL, 1972）. Further, socionics is not so much a theory of personalities per se, but much more a theory of type relations providing an analysis of the relationships that arise as a consequence of the interaction of people with different personalities."</blockquote></ref>。

人与人之间的关系是可以预测的，坚信此点的人们将他／她们的期望寄托于社会人格学之上。它是一个崭新的心理学理论，而体现这一关系的是被定义的16种[[人格|人格]]类型。

人格类型，也作社会人格类型，并非是短期存在的，也不是在一天或一年内就能被改变的。人格类型无关于个人的教育背景，所属的文化阶层以及他所从事的职业，它关乎的是日常环境中人与人间信息上的交换和行为上的互动<ref> '' Fink G. and Mayrhofer W . '' [http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/h040q1h67200h2n4/fulltext.html Cross-cultural competence and management] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121206034915/http://inderscience.metapress.com/content/h040q1h67200h2n4/fulltext.html |date=2012-12-06 }}   - setting the stage // European J. Cross-Cultural Competence and Management.   - 2009 .   - Vol. 1.   - No. 1. <blockquote> Personality profiling encompasses numerous models that arise from personality trait theory. In the context of this article, four models deserve special attention due to their importance in personality research and / or their appropriateness for the topic: Socionics（founded in the 1970s by Ausra Augustinavichiute, eg, Augustinavichiute, 1994, 1998）; cybernetic mindscape theory（Maruyama, 1980; Boje, 2004）; the five factor model (FFM), commonly called the 'big five "personality trait model（Costa and McCrae, 1992）; the personality type theory of the Myers-Briggs type inventory（MBTI, see McKenna et al., 2002）</blockquote> </ref>。每一种人格类型既有它的优势也有它的劣势：在社交过程中的能动性便在于多少地受到互动一方的牵制。很多时候，属同一类型的两个人看似是一对双胞胎，但事实上，他们并不存在血缘上的联系。这可能是人格类型由遗传基因所决定的一个证据。

人格类型在人际关系中扮演比教育更重要的角色。心理学包含有若干种各不相同的人际关系学理论。但很多心理学家会忽略人格类型在人际关系中的影响力，而认为所有现象都取决于人后天所受的影响，如背后的文化背景，所处的社会阶层，个人的成长过程和他们拥有的职业等等。就算某些接受了这人格类型一观点的专家，他们也无法给出一个统一的答案。
