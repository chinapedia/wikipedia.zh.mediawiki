== 個人生活 ==
利米·森的臉形有些令人想到印度的原著居民，她身材上也有完好的曲線，便利她獲得某些角色。

== 電影事業 ==
利米·森原先到[[孟買|孟買]]應徵[[可口可樂|可口可樂]]的廣告模特，得到[[Priyadarshan|Priyadarshan]]導演賞識而進入電影界，今天她已經在寶萊塢站住了腳跟。 

以下為近年的主要電影：
* [[Amitabh_Bachchan|Amitabh Bachchan]]的電影《''[[Baghban|Baghban]]''》
* Yash-Raj2004年大片《''[[Dhoom|Dhoom]]''》
* <!-- Her next releases--> 《''[[Phir_Hera_Pheri|Phir Hera Pheri]]''》
* 《''[[Golmaal_(film)|Golmaal]]''》 
* Yash-Raj的2006年大片《''[[Dhoom_2|Dhoom 2]]''》
<!--
have been successful at the box office. Her latest release ''[[Dhoom_2|Dhoom 2]]'', released on November 24, 2006, is another big hit, though she has very little presence in the film.

Rimi is now going by the screen name ''Rimii''. She explains the name change as a career move: there are many other Sens working in Bollywood right now, and a single name may help her stand out from the crowd and stay apart from others.She has indigeneous look of an Indian in her face which hasn't been yet properly tapped and the roles often are meant to show her curves and fairer body parts(in song ''Shikidum'' of Dhoom etc) than the artist in her. And she has also succumbed herself into such roles explicitly without any hesitations.
 
==Controversial Comments==
[[File:RimiSen2.jpg|right]]
Glamsham.com interviewed Sen in July 2006 about her work in the movie ''Golmaal''. In the interview Sen said, "I play a sweet and beautiful girl in the film. The best thing that I like about the film is that though it has four heroes, I am the only heroine. Rohit Shetty is amazing as a director. He can make even a black African look pretty." 

* [[Ligali|Ligali]], an African British group, condemned her statements and said it showed "how normalized anti-African ideology is within [[Bollywood|Bollywood]] and its audiences. It would be unlikely that her racist comments will hinder her career or that of the journalist and media organisation that published this anti-African statement." 

* Jaspreet Pandohar, Bollywood film critic for BBC Movies Online, said that Sen's comments were "shameful but not entirely surprising. It not only reflects her ignorance of other cultures and belief that black people can’t be naturally beautiful, but also illustrates India and Bollywood’s long-running obsession with fair skin. The sad thing is Rimi probably doesn’t even realise her comments can be construed as offensive and maybe sometimes even racist . It would be practically unheard of a British actor making these kinds of racist comments in the open and to the media. She's currently still in Indian Cinema."-->
