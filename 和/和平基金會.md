The Fund for Peace also considers, "Threat Convergence," or the idea that weak and failing states may contribute to global security threats such as the proliferation of [[weapons_of_mass_destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] and [[terrorism|terrorism]]. 

Another ongoing project is the Fund for Peace's Regional Responses to Internal War Program. This project is meant to enrich the international debate on humanitarian and military intervention in internal state conflicts. The program attempts to bring regional leaders together to discuss regional values in the hopes of reaching a consensus on how to handle regional humanitarian crises should they arise. The program's focus is on four geographic regions: [[Africa|Africa]], [[Asia|Asia]], [[the_Americas|the Americas]], and [[Europe|Europe]]. --><!-- Since 1996, Dr. Pauline H. Baker has been President of The Fund for Peace. Dr. Baker developed the methodology on which the Failed States Index is based. Her analytical model, the Conflict Assessment System Tool, furnishes early warning of internal state conflicts and assists in assessing post-conflict policies. Before coming to the Fund for Peace, Dr. Baker taught at the [[University_of_Lagos|University of Lagos]] in Nigeria, the [[Johns_Hopkins_School_of_Advanced_International_Studies|Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies]], and [[Georgetown_University|Georgetown University]]'s School of Advanced International Studies, as well as serving as a staff member of the [[United_States_Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations|United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]]. -->
