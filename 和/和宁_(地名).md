'''Rename the Dynasty'''

After Yi Seong-gye gained the throne, he would like to rename the new dynasty by his birthplace  thus sent 韓尚質 to Ming Dynasty（明朝）, China,saying:"  Vassal 趙琳 came back from the Capital(of Ming), after inquiring at the Ministry of Rites (of Ming明朝) (in accordance with Your Majesty--Ming Emperor 明太祖), and brought back Your Majesty's message that ‘if  Goryeo Korea will act in accordance with God and people, comforting the residents from the East, and ceasing the boundary conflicts, then fortunately there will be good relationship(between Ming and Goryeo Korea). (If not), report to me as soon as possible when the Korean Dynasty is renamed.’ Since the Wongs (Royal family of Goryeo Korea) of our small state  has collapsed due to its fool and immoral behaviour, your lowly vassal (Yi Seong gye) was elected to govern the state.  I (Yi Seong gye) felt terrified and unsettled until Your Majesty granted me the permission to the power. (However), in my personal view, your lowly Vassal (Yi Seong gye) dare not to rename the state freely by myself. (Therefore), with great respect, I have sent names such as‘Joseon(朝鮮)' and ‘He'ning(和寕)’to Your Majesty and I humbly wish Your Majesty to pick one (for me)." 

Ministry of Rites (of Ming) replied in accordance with Ming Emperor(明太祖):" 'Joseon(朝鮮)' is an ideal name for the state of the East (Korea), as it has been existing since the ancient and could be adopted (by you), in order to follow the God's will and govern the people, and get prosperity forever."，
