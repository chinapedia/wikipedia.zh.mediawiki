'''碳粒式[[麥克風|麥克風]]'''，有時稱作'''紐扣式麥克風'''或'''碳粒式傳聲器'''，是一種能將聲音轉化為電子信號的[[傳感器|傳感器]]，由兩片分開的金屬薄片及其之間的碳粒組成。朝外的那塊金屬薄片作為傳導震動片。當聲音使薄片振動時，會使其改變對碳粒的壓力，會進一步改變兩薄片之間的'''[[電阻|電阻]]''' (擠壓碳粒使其更加緊密，因此壓力越大薄片間電阻越小)。當在兩金屬薄片之間施加直流電壓，變化的電壓會帶來電流的變化，這些變化可以通過電話系統傳輸，或在電子系統中將聲音轉化成電信號。

在20世紀20年代，[[真空管|真空管]]電子放大器開始廣泛應用之前，碳粒式麥克風是獲得高品質音頻信號的唯一實際的方法，被廣泛用於電話系統中。它的製造成本低，輸出信號強，以及良好的高頻輸出特性使其非常適用於電話系統，直到20世紀80年代，新安裝的電話仍然在使用碳粒式麥克風。在此之前，它們在其他應用領域早已被其他類型的麥克風取代（在絕大多數的西方銅線電話網絡中，舊式基於碳粒式麥克風的電話仍在使用未被淘汰）。
碳粒式麥克風曾被廣泛應用於早期的調幅無線廣播系統中(一般為改進過的電話麥克風)，但由於它們有限的[[響應頻率|響應頻率]]，以及有較高的噪音，遂於19世紀20年代在該領域中被淘汰。接下來的數十年，它們繼續被廣泛應用於低端播音、軍事以及業餘無線電應用。<ref>Heil, B. The Microphone: A Short Illustrated History. ''QST'', 90(6), 50</ref>

==History==
The invention of the carbon microphone (then called a "transmitter") was claimed both by [[Thomas_Alva_Edison|Thomas Alva Edison]] in March 1877<ref name="IEEE">''IEEE Global History Network: Carbon Transmitter''. New Brunswick, NJ: IEEE History Center [http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Carbon_Transmitter]</ref> and separately by [[Emile_Berliner|Emile Berliner]] who filed related patent applications in June 1877 and August 1879.<ref>[http://www.invent.org/Hall_Of_Fame/13.html Inventors Hall of Fame], E. Berliner, {{US patent|0463,569}} filed June 1877, issued November 1891</ref> The two sides fought a long legal battle over the patent rights.  Ultimately a federal court awarded Edison full rights to the invention of the carbon microphone, saying "Edison preceded Berliner in the transmission of speech...The use of carbon in a transmitter is, beyond controversy, the invention of Edison" and the Berliner patent was ruled invalid. British courts also ruled in favor of Edison over Berliner. Having settled the Dowd suit (after Peter A. Dowd, agent of [[Western_Union|Western Union]]) out of court in 1881, Western Union left the telephone business, and sold Edison's patent rights and related assets to the [[Bell_System|Bell company]] in exchange for 20% of telephone rental receipts.  Subsequently Bell telephones used the Bell receiver and the Edison transmitter.<ref>Josephson, pp. 147-151</ref> Later, carbon granules were used between carbon buttons. Carbon microphones were widely used in telephones in the United States from 1890 until the 1980s.<ref name="IEEE"/>

==Carbon microphones used as amplifiers==
One of the surprising attributes of carbon microphones is that they can actually be used as [[amplifier|amplifier]]s. This capability was used in early [[telephone_repeater|telephone repeater]]s, making long distance phone calls possible in the era before vacuum tube amplifiers. In these repeaters, a magnetic telephone receiver (an electrical-to-mechanical [[transducer|transducer]]) was mechanically coupled to a carbon microphone. Because a carbon microphone works by varying a current passed through it, instead of generating a signal voltage as with most other microphone types, this arrangement could be used to boost weak signals and send them down the line. These amplifiers were mostly abandoned with the development of [[vacuum_tube|vacuum tube]]s, which offered higher [[gain|gain]] and better [[sound_quality|sound quality]]. Even after vacuum tubes were in common use, carbon amplifiers continued to be used during the 1930s in portable audio equipment such as hearing aids. The Western Electric 65A carbon amplifier was 1.2" in diameter and 0.4" high and weighed less than 1.4 ounces.<ref>{{cite web

By the 1950s, carbon amplifiers for hearing aids had been replaced by miniature vacuum tubes (only to be shortly replaced by transistors).{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} However, carbon amplifiers are still being produced and sold.<ref>{{cite web

One illustration of the amplification provided by carbon microphones was the oscillation caused by feedback, that resulted in an audible squeal from the old "[[candlestick_telephone|candlestick telephone]]" if its earphone was placed near the carbon microphone.

=== Early radio ===
Early [[Amplitude_modulation|AM]] [[radio_transmitter|radio transmitter]]s relied on carbon microphones for voice modulation of the radio signal. In the first long-distance [[sound|audio]] transmissions by [[Reginald_Fessenden|Reginald Fessenden]] in 1906, a [[continuous_wave|continuous wave]] from an [[Alexanderson_alternator|Alexanderson alternator]] was fed directly to the transmitting antenna through a water-cooled carbon microphone. Later systems using [[vacuum_tube|vacuum tube]] [[oscillators|oscillators]] often used the output from a carbon microphone to modulate the [[grid_bias|grid bias]] of the oscillator or output tube to achieve modulation.

==Current usage==
Apart from legacy telephone installations in [[Third_World|Third World]] countries, carbon microphones are still used today in certain niche applications in the developed world. An example is the Shure 104c,<ref>{{cite web
 |url=http://www.shure.com/idc/groups/tech_pubs/@global_managed/documents/webcontent/us_pro_104c_ug.pdf
 |title=Model 104C Guide

}}</ref> which is still in demand because of its wide compatibility with existing equipment.

The principal advantage carbon microphones have over other microphone types is that they can produce high-level audio signals from very low DC voltages, without needing any form of additional amplification or batteries. This is particularly useful in remote locations served by very long telephone lines, where the electrical resistance of the wires can lead to severe DC voltage drop. Most all-electronic telephones need at least 3 volts DC to work, and so will often become useless in such situations, whereas carbon transmitter telephones will continue to work down to a fraction of a volt. Even where they do work, electronic telephones also suffer from the so-called "cliff effect", whereby they abruptly stop working when the line voltage falls below the critical level. In particular, this means that one telephone on a "party line" may tend to "hog" the all line current, cutting the others off.  With carbon microphones, all receivers on the same line will still operate, albeit with reduced output. 

Carbon microphones are also widely used in safety-critical applications such as mining and chemical manufacture, where higher line voltages cannot be used, due to the risk of sparking and consequent explosions. Carbon-based telephone systems are also resistant to damage from high-voltage transients such as those produced by lightning strikes and [[electromagnetic_pulse|electromagnetic pulse]]s of the type generated by nuclear explosions, and so are still maintained as backup communication systems in critical military installations.
