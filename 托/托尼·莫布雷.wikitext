==生平==
===球員===
;米杜士堡
After playing his first match for the club in 1982, Mowbray became captain of Middlesbrough in [[1986–87_Middlesbrough_F.C._season|1986]] when he was just 22 years old. Affectionately known to Boro fans as "Mogga", Mowbray became a legend in Middlesbrough for being a [[Saltburn-by-the-Sea|local lad]] who led the club from [[Middlesbrough_F.C._survival_from_liquidation|liquidation]] back into the top league of English football within two seasons. 

In 2007, Mowbray was placed at number 7 in a chronological list of Middlesbrough [http://web.archive.org/web/20080123154521/http://www.gazettelive.co.uk/boro-fc/boro-legends/ legends] compiled by local newspaper the Evening Gazette. The Middlesbrough club fanzine Fly me to the Moon is named after a quote about Mowbray from ex-Middlesbrough manager [[Bruce_Rioch|Bruce Rioch]]–“If I had to fly to the moon I'd take Tony Mowbray, my captain, with me. He's a magnificent man”. After 348 appearances for Boro, Mowbray moved to [[Glasgow_Celtic|Glasgow Celtic]] for £1,000,000.

;些路迪
During his playing career with Celtic, Mowbray's wife Bernadette, a native of Renfrewshire, died of breast cancer. It is often asserted that the "huddle" which Celtic players still perform before each match was arranged as a tribute to Bernadette.<ref> {{cite news|url=http://www.birminghampost.net/midlands-birmingham-sport/west-midlands-sports/2006/10/14/shaped-by-passion-and-grief-65233-17940375|title=Shaped by passion and grief|work=[[Birmingham_Post|Birmingham Post]]|last=Jawad|first=Hyder|date=14 October 2006|accessdate=1 March 2010}}</ref> However, it was merely suggested by Mowbray on a pre-season tour of Germany to bring the squad together at a time of uncertainty. {{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

;葉士域治
He later moved on to [[Ipswich_Town_F.C.|Ipswich Town]], where he played for five years, becoming the team captain. He scored an equalising goal in the 2000 Division One playoff final victory against [[Barnsley_F.C.|Barnsley]]. Ipswich won the match 4–2 and secured promotion to the [[FA_Premier_League|FA Premier League]]. This match was both Mowbray's Wembley debut and the last of his playing career.

;葉士域治
Once his playing career finished he moved into coaching, starting as a first team coach at Ipswich Town. He had a brief spell as caretaker manager of Ipswich, following the sacking of [[George_Burley|George Burley]] and prior to the appointment of [[Joe_Royle|Joe Royle]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Davies|first=Christopher|title=Mowbray holds fort after Burley goes|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?xml=/sport/2002/10/12/sfnips12.xml|publisher=Telegraph|date=11 October 2002|accessdate=15 January 2008|location=London}}</ref>

;喜百年
In May 2004, Mowbray was appointed manager of [[Hibernian_F.C.|Hibernian]], replacing [[Bobby_Williamson|Bobby Williamson]].<ref>{{cite news|date=24 May 2004|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/h/hibernian/3741809.stm|title=Mowbray is new Hibs boss|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 August 2007}}</ref> He gained much acclaim for the job he did, winning the [[Scottish_Football_Writers'_Association|Scottish Football Writers' Association]] manager of the year award in his first season.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/scot_prem/4505709.stm Hartson wins writers' top prize], BBC Sport, 2 May 2005</ref> Hibs finished in the top four in the SPL in his only two full seasons in charge, which was the first time that Hibs had done this in the top division in consecutive seasons since [[Eddie_Turnbull|Eddie Turnbull]] was manager.

Hibs progressed to the later stages of every domestic cup competition in his tenure and made two appearances in European football. Hibs lost heavily to [[Dnipro_Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] in the first round of the [[2005-06_UEFA_Cup|2005-06 UEFA Cup]] and on the [[away_goals_rule|away goals rule]] to [[OB_Odense|OB Odense]] in the [[2006_Intertoto_Cup|2006 Intertoto Cup]]. During mid-2006, Mowbray was interviewed for the vacant managerial position at [[Ipswich_Town_F.C.|Ipswich Town]], but he rejected their approach.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/i/ipswich_town/4985882.stm Mowbray rejects Ipswich approach], BBC Sport, 19 May 2006.</ref> In September 2006 he signed a 12 month rolling deal with Hibs that was due to take effect from July 2007.<ref>{{cite news|date=7 September 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/scot_prem/5323912.stm|title=New Hibs deal for manager Mowbray|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=14 August 2007}}</ref> Just one month later however, Mowbray moved to [[West_Bromwich_Albion|West Bromwich Albion]].

;西布朗
In early October 2006, media reports linked him with the vacant managerial position at West Brom. On 10 October, it was confirmed by West Brom that they had asked Hibernian for permission to interview Mowbray, which was granted the following day. On 13 October, West Bromwich Albion announced that they had appointed Mowbray as their new manager.<ref>{{cite news|date=13 October 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams w/west_bromwich_albion/6043410.stm|title=Mowbray leaves Hibs for West Brom|publisher=BBC Sport|accessdate=25 April 2007}}</ref>

Mowbray replaced [[Bryan_Robson|Bryan Robson]] as Albion manager, and immediately faced the task of returning the Baggies to the [[FA_Premier_League|Premier League]] after relegation under Robson the previous season. Although he managed to turn around the club's poor away form, an indifferent run of results at home towards the end of the season meant that Albion finished fourth in The Championship table behind [[Sunderland_A.F.C.|Sunderland]], [[Birmingham_City_F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Derby_County_F.C.|Derby County]], and faced the lottery of the [[Football_League_Championship_playoffs|Championship Play-Offs]]. Despite two famous victories over old rivals [[Wolverhampton_Wanderers|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] in the semi finals, Albion lost 1–0 to [[Derby_County_F.C.|Derby County]] in the [[Wembley_Stadium|Wembley]] final.

As a result, during the close season, Mowbray set about restructuring his squad, moving out several of Robson's players for multi-million pound fees, after press reports of dressing room division.<ref>[http://www.expressandstar.com/2007/09/12/boss-i-had-to-clear-decks/ Boss: I had to clear decks] Express & Star, 12 September 2007</ref>  High profile players such as [[Jason_Koumas|Jason Koumas]], [[Diomansy_Kamara|Diomansy Kamara]] and [[Curtis_Davies|Curtis Davies]] were sold to Premier League clubs for large fees, in addition to the departures of [[Paul_McShane_(Irish_footballer)|Paul McShane]], [[Nathan_Ellington|Nathan Ellington]], [[Darren_Carter|Darren Carter]] and [[Steve_Watson|Steve Watson]]. Mowbray replaced them by signing a total of 14 permanent and loan players in the summer transfer window, making an overall profit in the process.  His most expensive signings were [[Chris_Brunt|Chris Brunt]] from [[Sheffield_Wednesday|Sheffield Wednesday]] for £3 million, [[Leon_Barnett|Leon Barnett]] from [[Luton_Town|Luton Town]] for £2.5 million, and [[James_Morrison_(footballer)|James Morrison]] from Middlesbrough for £1.5 million.

Despite the large changes in his squad, Mowbray won the [[Football_League_Championship_Manager_of_the_Month|Championship Manager of the Month award]] in September 2007, after Albion gained 13 out of the maximum 15 points and climbed to 2nd in the Division.<ref> {{cite news|date=4 October 2007|url=http://www.wba.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,10366~1127177,00.html|title=Mowbray wins award|publisher=West Bromwich Albion FC|accessdate=4 October 2007}}</ref> At the start of 2008, Mowbray's young Albion team topped the table, receiving growing plaudits from the media<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport.independent.co.uk/football/coca_cola/article3286759.ece|work=The Independent|title=West Bromwich Albion 4 Bristol City 1: Bednar fires Albion to the summit|first=Jon|last=Culley|date=27 December 2007|accessdate=25 May 2010|location=London}}</ref> and supporters<ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/sport/albion/tm_method=full%26objectid=20293494%26siteid=50002-name_page.html Mowbray hails Baggies fans] Birmingham Post, 28 December 2007</ref> alike for their attractive brand of attacking one touch passing football, a reflection of Mowbray's staunch footballing philosophy.<ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/birminghampost/sport/murphy/tm_method=full%26objectid=20233741%26siteid=50002-name_page.html Mowbray can pass Premier test] Birmingham Post, 11 December 2007</ref>

Mowbray guided West Brom to the [[Football_League_Championship|Football League Championship]] title, meaning promotion to the [[Premier_League_2008-09|Premier League]] and reached the [[FA_Cup_Semi-finals|semi-final]] of the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]]. The semi-final, the first to be played at the new [[Wembley_Stadium|Wembley Stadium]], pitted West Brom against Portsmouth, the only remaining Premier League team left in the FA Cup. Portsmouth won the match 1–0 with the only goal of the game coming from Kanu. Mowbray won the Championship manager of the month award for April,<ref>{{cite news|title=Mowbray claims managerial award|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_bromwich_albion/7391042.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=8 May 2008|accessdate=14 May 2008}}</ref> as well as the [[League_Managers_Association|League Managers Association]] manager of the year award.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ferguson wins managerial honour|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7397622.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 May 2008|accessdate=14 May 2008}}</ref>

After a poor 2008–09 season, West Brom were relegated from the Premier League, finishing 20th. Mowbray was still thought highly of by the fans, however, and this was evidenced by them wearing Mowbray masks at their last game of the season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/west-bromwich-albion-fc/west-bromwich-albion-fc-news/2009/05/06/baggies-fans-plan-masked-tribute-to-tony-mowbray-97319-23556332|title=Baggies fans plan masked tribute to Tony Mowbray|work=[[Birmingham_Mail|Birmingham Mail]]|date=6 May 2009|accessdate=9 June 2010|last=Montgomery|first=Ken}}</ref> Mowbray left the club for [[Celtic_F.C.|Celtic]] shortly afterwards.

Mowbray was described as "beleagured" by ''[[The_Herald_(Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' after Celtic fell 10 points behind [[Old_Firm|Old Firm]] rivals [[Rangers_F.C.|Rangers]] in the [[Scottish_Premier_League|SPL]] [[list_of_Scottish_football_champions|title]] race after a 2–1 [[Celtic_Park|home]] defeat by [[Hibernian_F.C.|Hibs]].<ref name = "herald">[http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/spl/hibernian/mowbray-refuses-to-admit-title-race-is-over-as-hibernian-put-massive-dent-in-celtic-s-championship-hopes-1.1001940 Mowbray refuses to admit title race is over as Hibernian put massive dent in Celtic’s championship hopes], ''[[The_Herald_(Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', 27 January 2010.</ref> Mowbray decided to make significant changes to his squad during the January 2010 transfer window, selling [[Gary_Caldwell|Gary Caldwell]] and [[Barry_Robson|Barry Robson]], which apparently caused disruption to the team in the immediate aftermath of those deals being completed.<ref name = "herald"/> As of 28 January 2010, Mowbray's record as Celtic manager was worse than [[John_Barnes_(footballer)|John Barnes]], who was sacked midway through his first season in charge.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/scotsol/homepage/sport/spl/2828052/Worse-than-Barnes.html|title=Worse than Barnes|first=Derek|last=McGregor|work=[[the_Sun_(newspaper)|The Sun]]|date=28 January 2010|accessdate=28 January 2010}}</ref> Further poor results, particularly a record 4–0 defeat by [[St._Mirren_F.C.|St. Mirren]], led to Mowbray being sacked on 25 March.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/c/celtic/8586352.stm|title=Celtic part company with manager Tony Mowbray|publisher=[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]|date=25 March 2010|accessdate=25 March 2010}}</ref>
