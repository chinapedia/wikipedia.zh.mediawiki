'''伦理困境'''也被称为'''道德悖论'''，是指陷于几个[[道德|道德]]命令之间的明显冲突，如果遵守其中一项，就将违犯另一项的情形。此情況下無論如何作為都可能與自身[[價值觀|價值觀]]及[[道德|道德觀]]有冲突。

比较著名的有[[有轨电车难题|有轨电车难题]]。伦理困境的形式化表示為如下：
:#A是道德上必須做的。
:#B也是道德上必須做的。
:#不過，我不能同時做A和B。<ref>Bernard Williams: ''Ethical Consistency''; in: Joseph Raz (Hrsg.): ''Practical Reasoning''; Oxford University Press 1978; ISBN 0198750412; S. 91−109</ref>

<!--  since in [[moral_philosophy|moral philosophy]], paradox plays a central role in ethics debates.例如，“关照你的邻居”这个道德告诫不常常充满矛盾, 但当你的邻居全副武装想要杀掉你的时候，情况就不一样的: 如果他成功了,你将不能继续关照他. 但是先发制人的打击或者武力阻止并不是传统意义上的“关照” 这是一个 [[ethical_decision|ethical decision]] clashing or conflicting with an organismic decision, one that would be made only from the perspective of animal survival:  an animal is thought to act only in its immediate perceived bodily self-interests when faced with [[bodily_harm|bodily harm]], and to have limited ability to perceive alternatives - ''see [[fight_or_flight|fight or flight]].'' -->
<!-- However, human beings have complex social relationships that can't be ignored:  If one has an [[ethical_relationship|ethical relationship]] with the neighbour trying to kill you, then, usually, their desire to kill you would likely be the result of [[mental_illness|mental illness]] on their part, stories told to them by others, e.g. their daughter claims you raped her.  Such conflicts might be settled by some other path that has strong social support.  Societies formed [[criminal_justice|criminal justice]] systems (some argue also [[ethical_tradition|ethical tradition]]s and [[religion|religion]]s) to defuse just such deep conflicts.  Such systems always impose trained judges who are presumed to have an ethical relationship and also a clear obligation to all who come before them. -->
<!-- == Refuting ethical dilemmas == -->
<!-- Ethical dilemmas are often cited in an attempt to refute an [[ethical|ethical]] system or [[moral_code|moral code]], as well as the worldview that encompasses or grows from it. {{Fact|date=February 2007}} -->
<!-- These arguments can be refuted in various ways, for example by showing that the claimed ethical dilemma is only apparent and does not really exist (thus is not a [[paradox|paradox]] logically), or that the solution to the ethical dilemma involves choosing the greater good and lesser evil (as discussed in [[value_theory|value theory]]), or that the whole [[framing|framing]] of the problem is omitting creative alternatives (as in [[peacemaking|peacemaking]]), or (more recently) that [[situational_ethics|situational ethics]] or [[situated_ethics|situated ethics]] must apply because the case can't be removed from context and still be understood.  ''See also [[case-based_reasoning|case-based reasoning]] on this process.'' -->
<!-- There are many examples of moral dilemmas; for instance, a more up to date dilemma is abortion. A woman who has been raped but found out that she is now pregnant from the rapist can choose whether to abort or to keep the fetus. The question is "whether the fetus has rights and, if so, how they are to be balanced against the right of the mother." [[Peter_Vardy|Peter Vardy]].  A further confounding factor is that pregnancy may threaten the life of the mother, thus implicating the mother's right to life, rather than her rights of bodily integrity and personal choice. -->
<!-- Perhaps the most commonly cited ethical conflict is that between an imperative or injunction not to steal and one to care for a family that you cannot afford to feed without stolen money.  Debates on this often revolve around the availability of alternate means of income or support, e.g. a [[social_safety_net|social safety net]], [[Charitable_organization|charity]], etc.  The debate is in its starkest form when framed as stealing food.  In ''[[Les_Misérables|Les Misérables]]'' Jean Valjean does this and is relentlessly pursued.   Under an ethical system in which stealing is always wrong and letting one's family die from starvation is always wrong, a person in such a situation would be forced to commit one wrong to avoid committing another, and be in constant conflict with those whose view of the acts varied. -->
<!-- However, there are few legitimate ethical systems in which stealing is '''more wrong''' than letting one's family die.  Ethical systems do in fact allow for, and sometimes outline, tradeoffs or priorities in decisions.  Some [[ethicist|ethicist]]s have suggested that [[international_law|international law]] requires this kind of mechanism to, for instance, resolve whether [[WTO|WTO]] or [[Kyoto_Protocol|Kyoto Protocol]] takes precedence in deciding whether a [[WTO_notification|WTO notification]] is valid.  That is, whether nations may use trade mechanisms to complain about measures each other takes regarding [[climate_change|climate change]].  As there are few economies that can operate smoothly in a chaotic climate, the '''dilemma''' would seem to be easy to resolve, but since fallacious justifications for restricting trade are easily imagined - just as, at the family level, fallacious justifications for theft are easily imagined - the seemingly obvious resolution becomes clouded by the suspicion of an illegitimate motive. Resolving ethical dilemmas is rarely simple or clearcut and very often involves revisiting similar dilemmas that recur within societies: -->
<!-- According to some philosophers and sociologists, e.g. [[Karl_Marx|Karl Marx]], it is the different life experience of people and the different exposure of them and their families in these roles (the rich being constantly stolen from, the poor in a position of constant begging and subordination) that creates [[social_class|social class]] differences.  In other words, ethical dilemmas can become political and economic factions that engage in long term recurring struggles.  ''See [[conflict_theory|conflict theory]] and [[left-wing_politics|left-wing politics]] versus [[right-wing_politics|right-wing politics]].'' -->
<!-- Design of a [[voting_system|voting system]], other [[electoral_reform|electoral reform]], a [[criminal_justice|criminal justice]] system, or other high-stakes [[adversarial_process|adversarial process]] for [[dispute_resolution|dispute resolution]] will almost always reflect the deep persistent struggles involved.  However, no amount of good intent and hard work can undo a bad role structure: -->
<!-- === Roles within structures === -->
<!-- Where a [[structural_conflict|structural conflict]] is involved, dilemmas will very often recur.  A trivial example is working with a bad [[operating_system|operating system]] whose error messages do not match the problems the user perceives.  Each such error presents the user with a dilemma:  [[boot_drive|reboot]] the machine and continue working at one's employment, or, spend time trying to reproduce the problem for the benefit of the developer of the operating system.  Often such dilemmas are resolved by our economic commitments:  While other users who will see the same message in future may want our feedback about errors, sad for them, they haven't paid us for it.  
So role structure sabotages feedback and results in sub-optimal results since no provision has been made to actually reward people for reporting these errors and problems.  ''See [[total_quality_management|total quality management]] for more on addressing this kind of failure, and [[governance|governance]] on how many ethical and structural conflicts can be resolved with appropriate supervisory mechanisms.'' -->
