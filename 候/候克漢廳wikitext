#{{note|1}}Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (1697–1759), the builder of Holkham, should not be confused with his grandnephew [[Thomas_Coke,_1st_Earl_of_Leicester_of_Holkham|Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester of Holkham]] (1754–1842) the celebrated [[agrarian|agrarian]] who also lived at Holkham Hall. Thomas Coke, 1st Earl of Leicester (builder of Holkham) died without surviving sons, hence his Earldom died with him.  Holkham then passed to Thomas Coke's nephew Wenman Roberts. Roberts assumed the Coke surname, but could not inherit the title. It was Wenman Roberts's son Thomas Coke, born in 1754 (the agrarian), for whom the title Earl of [[Leicester|Leicester]], of Holkham in the County of Norfolk, was created in 1837. The new title was an honour granted in recognition of the holder's services to [[politics|politics]] and [[agriculture|agriculture]]. As this [[earldom|earldom]] was of a new creation, he too became the 1st Earl. It is his descendant Edward Coke, 7th Earl of [[Leicester|Leicester]], who lives at Holkham today. The [[surname|surname]] "Coke" is pronounced "Cook".
#{{note|2}}The Earldom of Leicester has been, to date, created seven times.  Thomas Coke the builder of Holkham was the 1st Earl of the 5th creation. His grand nephew Thomas Coke was the 1st Earl of the 7th creation.
