;早年
While growing up in the [[Garston,_Hertfordshire|Garston]] area of [[Watford|Watford]]  Smith regularly played football on boys' teams. She developed her skills at [[Barnet_F.C._Ladies|Wembley Ladies]], making her debut for the squad in season 1994–95.  After moving to [[Arsenal_Ladies|Arsenal Ladies]] during 1996–97, she scored two goals and assisted on the third in a 3–0 win over [[Liverpool_L.F.C.|Liverpool]] which secured the [[FA_Women's_Premier_League_National_Division|Premier League]] title that season. She spent that year at [[West_Herts_College|West Herts College]], but transferred to [[Seton_Hall_University|Seton Hall University]] in the [[United_States|United States]] in 1997.

Smith enrolled at the university and was a student-athlete.  She played for [[Seton_Hall_Pirates|Seton Hall Pirates]] from 1997 through 1999.  In her first year at Seton Hall in 1997, Smith set scoring records for the [[Big_East_Conference|Big East Conference]] and became the first athlete in any sport to be the conference's (Offensive) Player of the Year and Newcomer of the Year in the same season.  In the following two seasons, she was the leading scorer not only in the Big East, but in the whole of [[National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association|NCAA]] [[Division_I_(NCAA)|Division I]], and was named Big East Offensive Player of the Year in both years.  At the end of her university career, the school retired her uniform number (6) — she became the first Seton Hall athlete in any sport other than basketball to have a number retired.  In her 3 years at Seton Hall, she set school records with 76 goals and 174 points while playing in just 51 matches.

;闖入美國
At the culmination of her studies Smith remained in America, remarking: "women's football in England is a joke."<ref name=hs/> Smith's first professional club was [[New_Jersey_Lady_Stallions|New Jersey Lady Stallions]] of [[W-League|W-League]], for which she played on from 1999 through 2000.  However, a new top-flight women's league was about to start in the [[United_States|United States]] and Smith stayed in the country to participate in the project.

The [[Women's_United_Soccer_Association|Women's United Soccer Association]] was formed in early 2000.  Smith was drafted 2nd overall in the 2001 WUSA Foreign Allocation [[draft_(sports)|Draft]] by [[Philadelphia_Charge|Philadelphia Charge]].  Smith played all 3 seasons with Philadelphia and was named to the 2001 WUSA Global 11 All-Star Team.  2001 was her only full season in the league; in 2002, Smith missed most of the season after tearing her [[anterior_cruciate_ligament|ACL]] in her right knee, and missed much of 2003 after re-injuring the same knee.  Unfortunately following the 2003 season, the WUSA ceased operations.

Smith decided to keep playing in the United States following the collapse of the WUSA.  In 2004, she played for the [[New_Jersey_Wildcats|New Jersey Wildcats]] in the [[W-League|W-League]], but she was injured yet again, breaking her leg.  She ended up appearing in 8 games for the club (563 minutes) and scored 8 goals and 6 assists.

Depressed and with a nascent drink problem,<ref name=drink>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1234891/Kelly-Smith-How-I-beat-drink-turned-Englands-best-player.html|title=Kelly Smith: How I beat the drink and turned into England's best player|publisher=The Daily Mail|author=Ashley Gray|date=2009-12-11|accessdate=2010-06-17 | location=London}}</ref> Smith returned to [[England|England]] and [[Arsenal_L.F.C.|Arsenal]] in the Autumn of 2004. She officially rejoined in 2005 after being treated at the [[Sporting_Chance_clinic|Sporting Chance clinic]].<ref name=drink/> However, she was yet again hampered by injury, this time by a stress fracture in her foot.  She returned to action at the end of the [[FA_Women's_Premier_League_2004-05|2004–05 season]], scoring a goal from 30 metres out against [[Charlton_Athletic_L.F.C.|Charlton Athletic L.F.C.]] which clinched the [[FA_Women's_Premier_League_National_Division|Premier League]] title for Arsenal.

In Arsenal's "[[The_Quadruple|Quadruple]]" winning season of 2006–07, Smith scored 30 goals in 34 games across the four competitions.  However, she missed both [[Two-legged_tie|legs]] of the [[2006–07_UEFA_Women's_Cup|2006–07 UEFA Women's Cup]] final through suspension, after being sent off for [[Finger_(gesture)|gesturing]] to opposition fans in the semi-final.<ref name=hs>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/sep/02/football.newsstory1|title=England's hot shot|publisher=The Guardian|author=Anna Kessel|date=2007-09-02|accessdate=2010-06-17 | location=London}}</ref>

Over the duration of Smith's Arsenal career since rejoining in 2005, she appeared in 66 Premier League games scoring 73 goals, 16 FA Cup games scoring 13 goals, 10 League Cup games scoring four goals, 18 UEFA Women's Cup games scoring nine goals, and two Community Shield games scoring one goal for a total of 112 appearances and 100 goals.  In her last competitive game for Arsenal, Smith scored a hat-trick to help Arsenal to a 5–0 win over [[Doncaster_Belles|Doncaster Belles]] in the [[FA_Women's_Premier_League_Cup|FA Women's Premier League Cup]]. She won the FA Women's Players' Player of the year in 2006<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.womenssoccerscene.co.uk/fa-womens-football-awards/fa-womens-football-awards.htm|title=It's a very proud moment - Kelly|publisher=Women's Soccer Scene|date=2006-05-28|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref> and 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thefa.com/England/Womens-seniors/news/2007/awardspiece|title=A season of achievement|publisher=TheFA.com|date=2007-05-23|accessdate=2010-06-17}}</ref>

;再闖美國
Upon the creation of a new women's league in the United States, [[Women's_Professional_Soccer|Women's Professional Soccer]], many teams were interested in Smith's services.  She was chosen by [[Boston_Breakers_(WPS)|Boston Breakers]] 2nd overall in the [[2008_WPS_International_Draft|2008 WPS International Draft]], above [[Marta_Vieira_da_Silva|Marta]] and under only [[Miraildes_Maciel_Mota|Formiga]].

Despite being drafted by Boston, she was still under contact with Arsenal.  However, Smith decided to leave Arsenal to join Boston Breakers on 18 February 2009, one of a number of English players to join the new [[Women's_Professional_Soccer|Women's Professional Soccer League]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/7877878.stm|title=Smith quits Arsenal for US league|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2009-02-08|accessdate=2009-02-09 | first=Tony | last=Leighton}}</ref><ref>http://www.arsenal.com/news/ladies-news/smith-joins-us-soccer-s-boston-breakers</ref>

In the inaugural [[2009_Women's_Professional_Soccer_season|2009 Women's Professional Soccer season]], Smith appeared in 15 games (13 starts, 1170 total minutes) and scored 6 goals with 2 assists.

Smith scored an injury-time penalty in [[England_women's_national_football_team|England]]'s 5-0 win at [[The_Valley_(London)|the Valley]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/englands-women-consolidate-position-1582898.html|title=England's women consolidate position|publisher=The Independent|date=1995-11-20|author=Liz Searl|accessdate=2010-06-17 | location=London}}</ref> The FA later complained to [[FIFA|FIFA]] when Smith's American college team refused to release her for national team duty.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/1999/oct/13/newsstory.sport7?INTCMP=SRCH|title=Americans body-check England women|publisher=The Guardian|date=1999-10-16|author=Vivek Chaudhary|accessdate=2011-02-13|location=London}}</ref> 

When healthy, she is generally considered to be one of the world's top female players; former [[United_States_women's_national_soccer_team|United States]] head coach [[April_Heinrichs|April Heinrichs]] asserted that Smith would be an automatic choice for the [[United_States_women's_national_soccer_team|United States Women's National Team]] if she had been eligible, and [[Vera_Pauw|Vera Pauw]], the [[Netherlands_women's_national_football_team|Dutch]] coach, called Kelly "the best player in the World" after she scored a hat-trick against the [[Netherlands_women's_national_football_team|Netherlands]] in a [[2007_FIFA_Women's_World_Cup|2007 FIFA Women's World Cup]] qualifier in 2006.<ref name=hs/>

Smith was voted third in the [[2009_FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year|2009 FIFA Women's World Player of the Year]], fourth in [[2007_FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year|2007]] and fifth in [[2006_FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year|2006]] and [[2008_FIFA_World_Player_of_the_Year|2008]].

In 2011, she competed in the [[2011_FIFA_Women's_World_Cup|FIFA World Cup]], where she scored from the spot in England's quarterfinal match with [[France_women's_national_football_team|France]], to give England a 1–0 lead in the [[penalty_shootout|penalty shootout]] (England would go on to lose the shootout 4–3).
