'''伯里克利时代'''是指[[古希臘|古希臘]]的一個歷史時期，其始於[[波希戰爭|波希戰爭]]，終於[[伯里克利|伯里克利]]離世或[[伯羅奔尼撒戰爭|伯羅奔尼撒戰爭]]結束，大约由前480年至前404年。在同一时期大批在[[政治|政治]]、[[哲学|哲学]]、[[建筑|建筑]]、[[雕塑|雕塑]]、[[历史|历史]]以及[[文学|文学]]上卓有成就的希腊人中，作为希腊将军、政治家和演说家，伯里克利仍然引人注目。他支持文学艺术，给[[雅典|雅典]]带来之后再也未曾有过的辉煌，他还主持大量公共项目以改善公民生活。所有这些使得雅典進入[[黄金时代|黄金时代]]，亦為[[古希腊|古希腊]]的全盛时期，故被称为伯里克利时代。

在这一世纪的时间里，雅典由十位每年由十个部落的公民选举出来的''στρατηγοι''（即将军）统治。这些''στρατηγοι''履行包括军队出征规划、其他城邦使者的接待和政治事务指导在内的各项责任。在民主派领导人[[厄菲阿尔特|厄菲阿尔特]]的统治时期，[[伯里克利|伯里克利]]还是厄菲阿尔特的副手。当厄菲阿尔忒斯在前461年被[[暗杀|暗杀]]后，伯利克里临危受命，并在前445年被选为''στρατηγοι''，从此一直在[[雅典集会|雅典集会]]上被推选连任这职位，直到他在前429年去世。

伯利克里是一位伟大的[[演说家|演说家]]; this quality brought him great success in the Assembly, presenting his vision of politics. One of his best moves was to allow [[thetes|thetes]]（Athenians without wealth）to occupy public office. Another success of his administration was the creation of the ''misthoforia''（μισθoφoρια, which literally means ''paid function''）, a special salary for the citizens that attended the Assembly. This way, these citizens were able to completely dedicate themselves to public service without facing financial hardship. With this system, Pericles succeeded in keeping the Assembly full of members. As Athens' ruler, he made the city the first and most important ''polis'' of the Greek world, acquiring a resplendant culture and democratic institutions.

The sovereign people governed themselves, without intermediaries, deciding the matters of state in the Assembly.  The Athenian citizens were free and only owed obedience to their laws and respect to their [[Greek_mythology|gods]].  They achieved [[social_equality|equality]] of [[freedom_of_speech|speech]] in the Assembly: the word of a poor person was the same worth as that of a rich person.  The [[censor|censorial]] classes did not disappear, but their power was more limited; they shared the fiscal and military offices but they did not have the power of distributing privileges.

The principal of equality granted to all citizens had the danger of constituting a fraud, since many of them were incapable of exercising the political rights, due to their extreme poverty or their ignorance.  To avoid this, the Athenian democracy applied itself to the task of helping the most poor in this manner:

*Concession of salaries for public functionaries.
*To seek for and supply work to the poor.
*To grant lands to dispossessed villagers.
*Public assistance for invalids, orphans and indigents.
*Other social helps.

These norms should have been carried out in great measure since the testimony has come to us (among others) from the Greek historian [[Thucydides|Thucydides]]（c. 460 - 400 BCE）, who comments: ''Everyone who is capable of serving the city meets no impediment, neither poverty, nor civic condition...''
