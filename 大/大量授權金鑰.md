'''大量授權金鑰'''（{{lang-en|'''Volume License Key'''}}，簡稱'''VLK'''）是軟件公司使用的一個詞彙，使用者購買批量授權，便會獲得一產品金鑰，該金鑰可安裝於多部電腦。換言之，企業可於多台[[電腦|電腦]]使用同一[[產品金鑰|產品金鑰]]，而不需為每台電腦輸入不同的金鑰。這種授權方式通常只給[[商業機構|商業機構]]、[[政府|政府]]和[[教育機構|教育機構]]，價格會因購買數量、類型和使用條款而不同。

[[Microsoft|Microsoft]]也會為其軟件提供大量授權，包括[[Windows_Vista|Windows Vista]], [[Windows_7版本列表|Windows 7 Enterprise]], [[Windows_Server|Windows Server 2008]], [[Microsoft_Office|Office 2007]]。<ref>

==Use of volume license keys==
Volume license keys can be used to activate multiple installations of software without any mechanism (such as a [[product_activation|product activation]] mechanism) checking the total number of installations. The [[software_license|license]] for the software will place restrictions on the use of the key. Typically the license will limit the key to a fixed number of installations which must only be within the licensee's organization and also place the licensee under an obligation to keep a record of the number of installations, keep the key confidential and possibly even require that the licensee organisation makes itself available for a [[software_licensing_audit|software licensing audit]] to verify that its use of the key falls within the terms of the license. If a volume license key becomes known and used outside of the organization to which it is licensed, then this is regarded{{by whom?|date=December 2012}} as [[software_piracy|software piracy]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

Volume license keys are not generally transferable between organisations; however, this can occur if the associated license agreement is transferred. If this happens, then the original licensee is required to cease all use of the key, and any software installed using it. This may occur when a company reorganises its structure, or when it sells unneeded software licences. Volume licenses are not always transferable; however, some types of Microsoft volume-license can be transferred provided a formal transfer-process is completed which enables Microsoft to register the new owner. A very small number of software vendors specialise in brokering such transfers in order to allow the selling of volume licenses and keys. The most notable of these, [[Discount-licensing.com|Discount-licensing.com]], pioneered the sale of Microsoft volume licenses in this way.<ref name="ol">

== MAK & KMS ==
從[[Windows_Vista|Windows Vista]]開始，[[Microsoft|Microsoft]]使用[[多次啟用金鑰|多次啟用金鑰]]（MAK, Multiple Activation Keys）和[[金鑰管理伺服器|金鑰管理伺服器]]（KMS, Key Management Server）取代舊的大量授權金鑰。客戶端需要每180天連回KMS。<ref>

== 濫用 ==

[[FCKGW|FCKGW]]等遭濫用的大量授權金鑰從Windows XP SP1時代開始湧現，並皆已由微軟列入黑名單。微軟稱他們無需滿足盜用者的軟件需求。為此微軟專門為Windows XP SP2研發了一個能檢測非法密鑰甚至未使用的非法密鑰的金鑰認證引擎。

Volume license keys that have been abused have been blocked by Microsoft, starting with Windows XP Service Pack 1. Microsoft argues that it does not need to cater to the needs of those who did not pay for their software. Microsoft even developed a new key verification engine for Windows XP Service Pack 2 that could detect illicit keys, even those that had never been used before. Several [[Computer_security|security]] consultants have condemned the move by Microsoft, saying that leaving a large install base unpatched from various security holes is irresponsible because this unpatched install base can be leveraged in large scale Internet attacks, such as [[Trojan_horse_(computing)|trojan horses]] used to send [[Spam_(e-mail)|spam e-mail]]. Others have come to Microsoft's defense, arguing that Microsoft should not have to provide support for illegal users. After much public outcry, Microsoft elected to disable the new key verification engine. Service Pack 2 only checks for the same small list of commonly used keys as Service Pack 1. Users of existing installations of Windows XP can also change their product key by following instructions from Microsoft.<ref>[http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;810892 Microsoft Help and Support: How to change the product key at the time of activation]</ref>

===Notable keys===
A volume license key that was commonly used to bypass [[product_activation|product activation]] in early versions of Microsoft's Windows XP operating system started with <code>FCKGW</code>.<ref>[http://www.bit-tech.net/news/gaming/2006/10/05/Microsoft_outlines_Vista_piracy_plans/1 bit-tech.net: Microsoft outlines Vista piracy plans, Published on 5th October 2006 by Wil Harris]</ref> This key was part of the first [[warez|warez]] release of the final version of Windows XP by a group called ''devils0wn'', 35 days before the official retail release on August 28, 2001.<ref>

</ref> The key is now obsolete, as it has been blacklisted by Microsoft since August 2004, and affected computers will display a [[Windows_Genuine_Advantage|WGA notification]].<ref>[http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2006/11/6122.ars arstechnica.com: Windows Genuine Advantage for dummies By Matt Mondok | Last updated November 29, 2006 6:19 PM]</ref> It was made famous partly because it featured in a popular image circulated on the Internet before the retail launch of Windows XP. In the image, the key is written on a CD-R containing the leaked operating system and held in front of a digital Microsoft sign counting down the days until the release of Windows XP.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.harshj.com/2007/03/19/more-on-the-fckgw-rhqq2-yxrkt-8tg6w-2b7q8/ |title=Harsh J: More on the FCKGW-RHQQ2-YXRKT-8TG6W-2B7Q8 |access-date=2014-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621130744/http://www.harshj.com/2007/03/19/more-on-the-fckgw-rhqq2-yxrkt-8tg6w-2b7q8/ |archive-date=2014-06-21 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>

Users using these keys will receive an error message when they install the latest service pack, and such users are told to obtain a legitimate license and change their product key.<ref>[http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-5034890.html TechRepublic Get IT Done: Change the product key on Windows XP]</ref>
