'''大都會北方鐵路'''（英文名稱為{{lang|en|'''Metro-North Commuter Railroad Company'''}}，簡稱'''Metro-North'''）是一個提供[[紐約上州|紐約上州]]與[[康乃狄克州|康乃狄克州]]的居民往返[[紐約市|紐約市]]的[[通勤鐵路|通勤鐵路]]。所有列車的紐約市終點站是[[大中央車站|大中央車站]]，往北可到達紐約州的瓦塞克（{{lang|en|Wassaic}}）、波基普希（{{lang|en|Poughkeepsie}}）、傑維斯港（{{lang|en|Port Jervis}}）與春谷（{{lang|en|Spring Valley}}）以及康州的紐坎楠（{{lang|en|New Canaan}}）、丹伯里（{{lang|en|Danbury}}）、[[沃特伯里_(康涅狄格州)|沃特伯里]]（{{lang|en|Waterbury}}）與[[紐黑文|紐黑文]]。

大都會北方鐵路是[[紐約大都會運輸署|紐約大都會運輸署]]所管理營運，並將之稱為'''{{lang|en|MTA Metro-North Railroad}}'''。在2002年10月時，大都會運輸署宣布未來將計劃將大都會北方鐵路與[[長島鐵路|長島鐵路]]，並稱為''{{lang|en|MTA Rail Road}}''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/mta/news/releases02/021009-reorg.htm |title=存档副本 |accessdate=2007-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070102163154/http://www.mta.nyc.ny.us/mta/news/releases02/021009-reorg.htm |archivedate=2007-01-02 }}</ref>。

==路線==
[[File:Metro-North_Railroad_Map.svg|thumb]]
大都會北方鐵路的路線主要以[[哈德遜河|哈德遜河]]為界分為兩部份。

===哈德遜河以東===
哈德遜河以東的部份有三條路線，各為[[哈德遜線|哈德遜線]]、[[哈林線|哈林線]]、以及[[纽黑文线|纽黑文线]]，而這三條線都是以[[大中央車站|大中央車站]]為終點站。紐海芬線另有三條支線，各為紐坎楠支線、丹伯里支線、以及渥特伯里支線。[[美鐵|美鐵]]也使用哈德遜線與紐海芬線提供前往[[紐約上州|紐約上州]][[奧本尼|奧本尼]]以及[[麻州|麻州]][[波士頓|波士頓]]的城際列車服務，不過美鐵在紐約市的停靠站為[[紐約賓夕法尼亞車站|賓夕法尼亞車站]]，而非大中央車站。哈德遜線與哈林線以前為[[紐約中央鐵路|紐約中央鐵路]]系統的一部分，而紐海芬線及其支線為[[紐約紐海芬及哈特福鐵路|紐約紐海芬及哈特福鐵路]]的一部分。

===哈德遜河以西===
哈德遜河以西的兩條路線是由[[紐澤西|紐澤西]]的霍伯肯車站發車，由於哈德遜河以西的路線絕大部份是位於紐澤西州境內，所以這兩條路線是與[[新泽西公共交通公司|新泽西公共交通公司]]合作，並且主要是由紐澤西捷運公司來營運。這兩條路線為[[傑維斯港線|傑維斯港線]]以及[[帕斯卡克谷線|帕斯卡克谷線]]，而過去都是屬於[[伊利鐵路|伊利鐵路]]的系統之下。

==Technical details==

Some services are operated by [[diesel|diesel]], but all services running directly into [[Manhattan|Manhattan]] [[Grand_Central_Terminal|Grand Central Terminal]] are electric powered. Most of Metro-North's passenger diesel locomotives are [[General_Electric|General Electric]] [[GE_Genesis|GENESIS P32]] diesel-electric hybrids capable of switching to a pure electric mode using contact shoes to contact the railroad's under-running [[third_rail|third rail]] power distribution system. On the Hudson Line, trains are powered by electrified third rail from [[Grand_Central_Terminal|Grand Central Terminal]] to [[Croton-Harmon_(Metro-North_station)|Croton-Harmon]] and are powered by diesel north of that station to [[Poughkeepsie_(Metro-North_station)|Poughkeepsie]]. The Harlem Line has third rail from [[Southeast_train_station|Southeast]] station and diesel north of that station to [[Wassaic_(Metro-North_station)|Wassaic]]. The New Haven Line is special in that trains are electrically powered through either 700 V [[Direct_current|DC]] from a third rail or 13.8 kV [[Alternating_current|AC]] from an overhead [[Catenary_(railways)|catenary]] wire. Nominally 13.8 kV (per a MN Power Director), the voltage floats between 13.2 to 13.8 kv. The main line from approximately [[Woodlawn_(Metro-North_station)|Woodlawn]] to [[Pelham_(Metro-North_station)|Pelham]]  (3 miles), is powered by third rail, while from [[Pelham_(Metro-North_station)|Pelham]], New York east to [[Union_Station_(New_Haven)|New Haven, Connecticut]] (58 miles), as well as the entire [[New_Canaan_Branch|New Canaan Branch]], it is powered by catenary. The [[Danbury_Branch|Danbury Branch]] was formerly electrified but in 1961 became a diesel-only line though plans are underway to reelectrify the line [http://www.danburybranchstudy.com/] with a concurrent expand to [[New_Milford,_Connecticut|New Milford]]. Locomotives on the [[Waterbury_Branch|Waterbury Branch]], the only east-of-Hudson Metro North service which has no direct service of any sort into Grand Central, are powered by diesel.

The third rails on the three Metro-North lines (East-of-Hudson) which go into Grand Central Terminal are unusual in that power is collected from below the [[third_rail|third rail]] as opposed to above, unlike most other third rail systems (including the [[Long_Island_Rail_Road|Long Island Rail Road]] and [[New_York_City_Subway|New York City Subway]]). This allows the third rail to be completely insulated from above, thus decreasing the chances of a person being electrocuted by coming in contact with the rail. This was important, because until the early 1970s the majority of the suburban stations had low platforms where the third rail was easily accessible; this danger was greatly reduced with the introduction of the high-level platforming of [[Budd_Company|Budd Company]]-made [[Budd_Metropolitans|Metropolitans]] in 1971 and the [[Budd_Cosmopolitans|Cosmopolitans]] two years later, both purchased by the MTA and practically identical to their sister cars on the LIRR.

West of Hudson trains are entirely handled by EMD [[EMD_GP40-based_passenger_diesels|GP40FH-2]] or [[EMD_F40PH|F40PH-2CAT]] diesel lcomotives, although any MN or [[New_Jersey_Transit|New Jersey Transit]] diesel can show up and the MN diesels based out of Hoboken are banned from the [[Pascack_Valley_Line|Pascack Valley Line]] due to the installation of SES. Passenger cars are basically all [[Comet_(passenger_car)|Comet V]] coaches built by [[Alstom|Alstom]], but again anything can show up as the equipment is pooled with NJT.

==Fare policy==

Tickets for travel may be bought from a station agent, automated machine, online, or on the train.  There is a 5% discount for buying tickets online, while buying tickets on the train costs up to twice as much as the standard price.

Again, West of Hudson policies are different due to the trains being operated by [[NJ_Transit|NJ Transit]].
