'''大祭司'''（[[希伯来语|希伯来语]] '''כהן גדול'''，'''Kohen Gadol'''或'''Kohen ha-Gadol'''）是早期[[犹太教|犹太教]]最高宗教领袖的头衔（从以色列人出埃及后在旷野漂流时期到第二[[耶路撒冷圣殿|耶路撒冷圣殿]]被毁）。大祭司与所有祭司一样，只有属于亚伦后裔可以担任。

献祭的仪式<!-- extending through an entire week (Ex. xxviii.; Lev. viii.), included certain rites which 所有祭司 were required to undergo: purification; the [[Korban|sacrifices]]; the "filling" of the hands; the smearing with blood. But Aaron the high priest was anointed with sacred oil, hence the title of the "anointed priest"; other passages have it that all priests were anointed (Ex. xxviii. 41, xxx. 30; Lev. vii. 36, x. 7; Num. iii. 3). The high priest's vestments of office, which he wore, during his ministrations, above those prescribed for the common priests, were: the "me'il," a sleeveless, purple robe, the lower hem of which was fringed with small golden bells alternating with [[pomegranate|pomegranate]] tassels in violet, red, purple, and scarlet; [[Ephod|Ephod]], with two [[onyx|onyx]]-stones on the shoulder-piece, on which were engraved the names of the tribes of Israel; the breastplate ("koshen"), with twelve gems, each engraved with the name of one of the tribes; a pouch in which he probably carried [[乌陵_and_土明|乌陵 and 土明]]. His Head-Dress was the "miknefet," a tiara, or, perhaps, a peculiarly wound [[turban|turban]], with a peak, the front of which bore a gold plate with the inscription "Holy unto [[YHWH|YHWH]]." His girdle seems to have been of more precious material than that of the common priests. -->

第一次献祭由摩西执行，<!-- the Bible does not state who consecrated subsequent 大祭司。Lev. xxi. 10 states emphatically that every new 大祭司shall be anointed; and Ex. xxix. 29 et seq. commands that the official garments worn by his predecessor shall be worn by the new incumbent while he is anointed and during the seven days of his consecration (comp. Num. xx. 28; Ps. cxxxiii. 2). -->

<!-- ==Sanctity and functions==
The distinguished rank of 大祭司 is apparent from the fact that his sins are regarded as belonging also to the people (Lev. iv. 3, 22). He was entrusted with the stewardship of the Urim and Thummim (Num. xxvii. 20 et seq.). On [[Yom_Kippur|Yom Kippur]] he alone entered [[至圣所|至圣所]], to make atonement for his house and for the people (Lev. xvi.); on that occasion he wore white linen garments instead of his ordinary and more costly vestments. He alone could offer the sacrifices for the sins of the priests, or of the people, or of himself (Lev. iv.); and only he could officiate at the sacrifices following his own or another priest's consecration (Lev. ix.). He also offered a meal- offering every morning and evening for himself and the whole body of the priesthood (Lev. vi. 14-15, though the wording of the law is not altogether definite). Other information concerning his functions is not given. He was privileged, probably, to take part at his own pleasure in any of the priestly rites. Josephus ("B. J." v. 5, § 7) contends that the high priest almost invariably participated in the ceremonies on the [[Shabbat|Shabbat]], the [[Rosh_Chodesh|New Moon]], and the festivals. This may also be inferred from the glowing description given in Ecclus. (Sirach) i. of 大祭司's appearance at the [[altar|altar]]. -->


大祭司是犹太祭司制度中居最高地位的人，兼任犹太最高议会主席职。每年赎罪日大祭司必须进入圣殿的至圣所，为他自己和以色列人的罪献祭。

== 基督教 ==
耶穌是以大衛後裔永續國王的身份於基督教被稱為大祭司，其不同於猶太教的大祭司在，耶穌是君王以自己作獻物。
