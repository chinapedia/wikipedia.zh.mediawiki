<!--==劇情==
During a [[freestyle_rap|freestyle rap]] battle with Rap Bear, hosted by Party Pat (voiced by [[Andy_Samberg|Andy Samberg]]), Finn is approached by Billy's (voiced by [[Lou_Ferrigno|Lou Ferrigno]]) ex-girlfriend, Canyon (voiced by [[Ako_Castuera|Ako Castuera]]). She delivers Billy's loincloth to Finn, and Finn and her venture back to Billy's lair to pay their respects and move on. At his cavern, Finn defeats a group of fairies and then discovers a [[:wikt:bucket_list|bucket list]] penned by Billy. Canyon and Finn decided to complete it as a tribute to the fallen hero. The two go on a [[joyride_(crime)|joy ride]] in a desert environment, and afterwards Canyon and Finn part ways. Finn soon discovers that the list contains one more item hidden at the bottom left corner reading: "Lie on my back in the ocean. Just float."

Finn, terrified of the ocean, decides to do this final task for Billy, but the Fear Feaster (voiced by [[Mark_Hamill|Mark Hamill]]) manifests and taunts him, until he knocks himself unconscious; during this time, he has an intense dream of swimming through the ocean and being consumed by a whale. Eventually he wakes up, and—possibly involuntarily—uses his grass sword to slice through and destroy the Fear Feaster, ending Finn's ocean fear for good. The spirit of Billy manifests itself before Finn in the sky, thanking him for completing his list. Before his spirit departs, he reveals to Finn that his human father is still alive, trapped in a mysterious place known only as the "Citadel".
