'''大洋城（Ocean City）''' ('''OC''' 或 '''OCMD''')，正式名稱為大洋城鎮（Town of Ocean City），是美國馬里蘭州[[烏斯特郡_(馬里蘭州)|烏斯特郡]]瀕臨大西洋的一個度假城鎮。大洋城是美國中大西洋地區著名的旅遊地，在2010年的調查中人口為7,102人，屬於[[:en:Salisbury_metropolitan_area|梳士巴利都會區]]。但在夏天的周末，本城會有 320,000 至345,000 位遊客，每年遊客高達八百萬人。<ref name="ocean-city1"/> 因此在夏天大洋城是馬里蘭州第二大城。

==歷史==
[[File:Ocean_City_MD_historical_marker.jpeg|thumb]]
大洋城所在地是英國人湯瑪斯‧芬維克（Thomas Fenwick）從印地安人手中取得的。1869年建立了第一座商業性的海濱小屋。當時遊客搭乘馬車與渡輪抵達，出海釣魚並享受沙灘、撿拾貝殼。1875年7月4日，鎮上開設了第一家較大的旅館。

<!--Soon after, other simple boarding houses were built on the strip of sand, with the activity attracting prominent businessmen from the [[Maryland_Eastern_Shore|Maryland Eastern Shore]], [[Baltimore,_Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]], and [[Wilmington,_Delaware|Wilmington]]. They came not so much to visit as to survey the [[spit_(landform)|spit]]. A decision was made to develop it and 250 lots were cut into it, and a corporation was formed to help with the development of the land. The corporation stock of 4,000 shares sold for $25 each.

Prior to 1870, what is now Ocean City was known as "The Ladies' Resort to the Ocean."

The Atlantic Hotel, the first major hotel in the town, opened July 4, 1875. Besides the beach and ocean, it offered dancing and billiard rooms to the visitors of its more than 400 rooms, and for years it was the northern-most attraction in Ocean City. By 1878 tourists could come by railroad from [[Berlin,_Maryland|Berlin]] to the shores of Sinepuxent Bay across from the town. By 1881, a line was completed across [[Sinepuxent_Bay|Sinepuxent Bay]] to the shore, bringing rail passengers on the [[Pennsylvania_Railroad|Baltimore, Chesapeake and Atlantic Railroad]] directly into the town to a train station on Philadelphia Avenue and returning to larger city markets with locally caught fish from Ocean City.-->

[[Image:Oceancitymd_inlet.JPG|thumb]]1933年的一次大颶風摧毀了跨越Sinepuxent Bay的鐵路，也形成了大洋城海口（Ocean City Inlet），將大洋城與阿薩提格島（Assateague Island）分開。美國陸軍工兵署裡藉此機會將大洋城南端的開口永久化，使得船隻更容易進出大西洋，大洋城從此成為中大西洋地區重要的漁港。

<!--
In the late 1930s, the Army Corps of Engineers dredged a new channel on the bayside of Ocean City to allow larger boats to have access to Sinepuxent Bay. The dredge was pumped back onto the western shore of Ocean City allowing the creation of Chicago Avenue and St. Louis Avenue, leading to new development where previously only marshland had been.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20130822/NEWS/308220064/How-1933-hurricane-carved-lifeline-Ocean-City-Md- |title=存档副本 |access-date=2014-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202192133/http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20130822/NEWS/308220064/How-1933-hurricane-carved-lifeline-Ocean-City-Md- |archive-date=2015-02-02 |dead-url=yes }}</ref>

Rapid expansion of Ocean City took place during the post-war boom. In 1952, with the completion of the [[Chesapeake_Bay_Bridge|Chesapeake Bay Bridge]], Ocean City became easily accessible to people in the [[Baltimore–Washington_metropolitan_area|Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area]]. In 1964, with the completion of the [[Chesapeake_Bay_Bridge-Tunnel|Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]], a whole new pathway to the south was opened. Ocean City became one of the largest vacation areas of the East Coast.

By the 1970s, big business flourished and gave birth to the construction of more than 15,000 condominium units, creating a spectacular sight of high-rise condominiums that assured every investor of a glimpse of the ocean and pounding surf. However, throughout the 1980s, and into the 1990s, the width of the beach began to shrink, prompting the first of a series of [[beach_nourishment|beach replenishment]] projects.

The original pier was destroyed by a fire in 1994. There was a small water park and giant walk-through haunted house with live actors near the end of the pier and a New Orleans-style Hollywood in Wax Museum on the boardwalk side. In the late 1980s the Wax Museum was turned into a Photon [[laser_tag|laser tag]] arena. The building now houses the [[Ripley's_Believe_it_or_Not!|Ripley's Believe it or Not!]] museum.

In 2002, Ocean City undertook the most recent of many, multi-million dollar, [[beach_restoration|beach restoration]] programs, in an attempt to slow the westward migration of its beaches. The program pumped tons of sand from offshore and deposited it onto the beach. A dune line was also re-established in front of Ocean City's building line.  Another similar project began after the 2006 tourist season closed.

===Recent history===
[[File:Ocean_City_MD_Boardwalk_August_2009_1.jpg|thumb]]
[[File:Ocean_City_MD_Boardwalk_August_2009_3.jpg|thumb]]
Today, the Ocean City area continues to sprawl westward across the bay and toward [[Berlin,_Maryland|Berlin]] and [[Ocean_Pines,_Maryland|Ocean Pines]]. It is part of the Ocean Pines [[Micropolitan_Statistical_Area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]]. The resort area accommodates approximately 8 million visitors per year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ococean.com/media |title=Ocean City Maryland - Media |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ocean City Maryland Convention and Visitors Bureau and Department of Tourism |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>
 
Ocean City now extends just more than {{convert|9|mi|abbr=on}} from the southern inlet to the Delaware line. The strip now supports hotels, motels, apartment houses, shopping centers, residential communities, and condominiums. The southern tip houses the Ocean City [[Boardwalk#Ocean_City,_Maryland|Boardwalk]]. The boardwalk is the main shopping district and entertainment area of the town. The boardwalk has many prominent businesses including Fisher's Caramel Popcorn and [[Thrashers_French_Fries|Thrashers French Fries]]. Other notable boardwalk businesses are [[Dolle's_Salt_Water_Taffy|Dolle's Salt Water Taffy]], the [[Atlantic_Stand|Atlantic Stand]], and [[Dumser's_Dairyland|Dumser's Dairyland]].  The Boardwalk has two [[amusement_park|amusement park]]s, [[Trimpers_Rides|Trimpers Rides]] and The Pier, which was recently renamed [[Jolly_Roger_Amusement_Park|Jolly Roger at The Pier]], after [[Jolly_Roger_Amusement_Park|its sister uptown local amusement park]]. The downtown neighborhood, Old Town, is marked by Victorian style houses and other older buildings, many of which have been razed in recent years to construct more parking lots, hotels, and condos.

Ocean City has a long history of fishing, both commercial and recreational. The town bills itself as the "White Marlin Capital of the World." During the summer numerous charter and private boats fish for [[billfish|billfish]], [[tuna|tuna]], [[wahoo|wahoo]], and other game fish. In early August, one of the largest fishing tournaments in the world, the White Marlin Open, is held. Prize money for the largest [[White_Marlin|White Marlin]], [[Atlantic_blue_marlin|Blue Marlin]], and [[Tuna|Tuna]] can range over 1 million dollars.

The town supports a year-round population of about 8,000, with the town itself being a major employer. Summer employment in Ocean City rises many multiples above that level, supported by a large number of college-age and young adults - many native to Eastern Europe and Ireland - attracted by numerous job opportunities. In the summer, businesses and government agencies are augmented with about 100 seasonal police officers, plus extra firefighters and other workers.

Tourism in the winter has picked up pace. Where once even many traffic lights were shut down or bagged up, increased traffic from golfers and [[Ocean_City_Convention_Center|Ocean City Convention Center]] conventions has convinced many seasonal restaurants and hotels to remain open. Many bars and restaurants that close during the winter re-open for St. Patrick's Day.

The city has erected a memorial to the firefighters who lost their lives on September 11. This memorial is located on the boardwalk, about six blocks from the inlet. The memorial consists of a firefighter statue, engraved brick and stone, and a piece of one of the [[World_Trade_Center|twin towers]] that collapsed in [[New_York_City|New York City]]. Ocean City is home to the annual Maryland State Firefighters Convention. This is a week-long event in June, that honors the state's firefighters with events and contests at the Convention Center, and ends with a parade.

Northern Ocean City houses many high-rise beachfront condominiums and hotels such as Century I, The Seawatch, Golden Sands Club, and The Carousel. This area is easily recognizable because of its city-like skyline.

==Geography==
[[File:Ocean_City_MD_pier_from_south.jpeg|thumb]]
Ocean City is located at {{coord|38.391526|-75.069712|type:city_region:US|format=dms|display=inline}}.{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United_States_Census_Bureau|United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|36.37|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which, {{convert|4.41|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|31.96|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name ="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United_States_Census_Bureau|United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref>

Ocean City is on the barrier [[Spit_(landform)|spit]] called [[Fenwick_Island_(Delaware–Maryland)|Fenwick Island]], which encompasses Ocean City, [[South_Bethany,_Delaware|South Bethany, Delaware]], and [[Fenwick_Island,_Delaware|Fenwick Island, Delaware]].  Ocean City's southern point is an [[inlet|inlet]] formed by the [[1933_Chesapeake–Potomac_hurricane|1933 Chesapeake–Potomac hurricane]].  Rainfall and tides swelled the rivers and bays surrounding Ocean City until the overflowing water cut a 50 foot [[crevasse|crevasse]] from the bay to the ocean.  Ocean City businessmen had long sought funding to create an inlet to support a harbor, so residents seized upon the opportunity and built jetties to ensure the city's land remained divided from what is now [[Assateague_Island|Assateague Island]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/eastern-shore/bal-hurricane2003,0,7880742.story|title=Reborn in a Hurricane|work=www.baltimoresun.com|publisher=[[The_Baltimore_Sun|The Baltimore Sun]]|accessdate=2009-08-31}}</ref>

===Climate===
Ocean City has a [[humid_subtropical_climate|humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen_climate_classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with hot, humid summers, mild winters, and precipitation fairly evenly distributed throughout the year. Due to its location on the Atlantic coast, daytime temperatures in spring and summer are moderated, with an average of only 10 days annually reaching {{convert|90|°F|0}}. Conversely, in winter there is an average of 5.8 days where the temperature fails to rise above freezing. The prominence of the [[Outer_Banks|Outer Banks]] of [[North_Carolina|North Carolina]] to the south means direct hits from [[tropical_storm|tropical storm]]s and [[hurricane|hurricane]]s are rare, although they sometimes brush the area.

Three bridges connect the spit to the mainland. [[U.S._Route_50_in_Maryland|U.S. Route 50]] crosses the [[Harry_W._Kelly_Memorial_Bridge|Harry W. Kelly Memorial Bridge]] and connects to MD 528 at N. Division Street. Ocean City is the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 50.  Near [[Sacramento,_California|Sacramento, California]] along U.S. 50 is a mileage sign whimsically stating the distance to Ocean City, MD (3,073 miles).  [[Maryland_Route_90|Maryland Route 90]], a two-lane freeway, crosses the [[Assawoman_Bay_Bridge|Assawoman Bay Bridge]] and connects to MD 528 at 62nd Street.  [[Delaware_Route_54|Delaware Route 54]] can also be used to reach Ocean City, as it meets Coastal Highway just north of the border.

[[File:Ocean_City,_Maryland_North_End_Transit_Stop.jpg|thumb]]Ocean City also has a public transportation system referred to as the "Beach Bus". The bus runs along pretty much the entire length of the city 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year round. It travels on Coastal Highway between 15th Street and the 144th Street transit center. South of 15th Street, the bus runs on Philadelphia Ave. heading south to the S. Division Street transit center and on Baltimore Ave. heading north through the Downtown area. There is also a park-and-ride service known as the West Ocean City Park and Ride. Patrons can park their cars at the Park and Ride's lot in West Ocean City off U.S. Route 50 and take a separate bus into the city to connect with the Coastal Highway Beach Bus. This service also serves the [[Tanger_Outlets|Tanger Outlets]] in West Ocean City. During the summer season, the city hires additional operators for the highest periods of ridership. These seasonal bus drivers are frequently retirees from other transit authorities as well as school bus drivers across the state of Maryland who are off during the summer season while schools are not in session.

Ocean City's transit service connects with [[Shore_Transit|Shore Transit]] where patrons can travel to or from destinations on the Eastern Shore such as [[Salisbury,_Maryland|Salisbury]] and [[Pocomoke_City,_Maryland|Pocomoke]]. This connection point is the West Ocean City Park and Ride in the summer and the S. Division Street transit center in the off season. Between Mid-May and Mid-September, [[DART_First_State|DART]] Resort Transit also connects Ocean City transit at the 144th Street transit center with the resort towns of Delaware which connects with regular DART service or shuttle service from the [[Cape_May-Lewes_Ferry|Cape May-Lewes Ferry]] to [[Cape_May,_New_Jersey|Cape May, New Jersey]].

The Ocean City Transits fleet consists mainly of Thomas built buses. The CL960 model and the TL960 model both in {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} lengths. They do run Eldorado National XHF buses in a {{convert|35|ft|m|sing=on}} length which run on Coastal Highway in the off season and the West Ocean City Park and Ride in the summer season. Ocean City did purchase a new order of at least 8 Blue Bird Xcel 102s in a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}} length recently. They were purchased to replace the oldest set of Thomas built buses on the Ocean City fleet, which were also numbered as 270s. In past years, Ocean City received somewhere about 10-17 [[Articulated_bus|Articulated bus]]es that are being retired by [[Maryland_Transit_Administration|MTA Maryland]] which were built by [[North_American_Bus_Industries|North American Bus Industries]] in 1995-96. The buses were frequently borrowed every summer to maintain the increase in ridership and crowding of their current 40-foot vehicles.

Ocean City also maintains a fleet of open-air shuttles which run along the Boardwalk called the Boardwalk Tram. The trams run the entire length of the boardwalk from S. Division Street to 27th Street between Memorial Day and Labor Day Weekends, and also during special event weekends such as Springfest or Sunfest. South of 5th Street, the tram has a separate concrete path it runs on parallel to the boardwalk. North of this, a marked lane down the middle of the boardwalk warns pedestrians of the shuttle.  Passengers board and alight at any point along the route by notifying the driver.
