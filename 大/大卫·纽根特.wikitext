==生平==
<!--
===球會===
;早年
Born in [[Huyton|Huyton]], [[Merseyside|Merseyside]], Nugent was a member of the  [[Liverpool_F.C.|Liverpool]] youth academy but left in 2001, aged 15, without being offered a professional contract. It was only once he changed his position that he then became a professional with [[Bury_F.C.|Bury]], joining the club's successful Youth and Centre of Excellence department. After making his debut as a substitute against [[Port_Vale_F.C.|Port Vale]] in March 2002 at the age of just 16, Nugent initially struggled to live up to his early potential, but an explosive start to the [[2004-05_in_English_football|2004–05]] [[Football_League_Two|Football League Two]] campaign saw several larger clubs take an interest.

;普雷斯頓
Although a target for rivals [[Burnley_F.C.|Burnley]], Nugent opted to join [[Preston_North_End_F.C.|Preston North End]] rather than [[Northampton_Town_F.C.|Northampton Town]] from [[Bury_F.C.|Bury]] in January 2005 for a fee of £100,000 and proved himself more than worthy at Championship level.

He scored 10 league goals in 32 Championship appearances in [[2005-06_in_English_football|2005–06]], as Preston finished fourth, losing to [[Leeds_United_F.C.|Leeds United]] in the playoff semi-final, thus failing to gain promotion. Despite transfer speculation, Nugent spent the following season at Preston, scoring 15 goals in 43 appearances, and winning England recognition. Preston finished seventh in [[2006-07_in_English_football|2006–07]].

Nugent left Preston during the summer of 2007.

;樸茨茅夫
After both [[Sunderland_A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Portsmouth_F.C.|Portsmouth]] had bids in the region of £6 million accepted for the player, Nugent was eventually unveiled as a Pompey player at a press conference alongside [[John_Utaka|John Utaka]] on 11 July 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/6280240.stm|title=Nugent seals £6m Portsmouth move|accessdate=2007-07-11|date=2007-07-11|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> However, rumours followed just weeks later that [[Derby_County_F.C.|Derby County]] were considering a bid for Nugent and that he would be leaving Portsmouth in the same transfer window he arrived in. Nugent scored on his debut in a non-competitive 8-0 win against [[Isle_of_Wight|Isle of Wight]] side [[Newport_(IOW)_F.C.|Newport]] and later signed many autographs in a fan-filled pitch invasion. In a post-match press conference following a Carling Cup game early on in Nugent's Pompey career, in which he scored his first goal for the club, Portsmouth manager [[Harry_Redknapp|Harry Redknapp]] publicly stated Nugent would be free to leave the club if the right offer came in to help fund a move for more players. However, Nugent stated he wanted to stay at Portsmouth.<ref>{{cite news |title=Redknapp: Nugent could leave Pompey. Davidinstead.|url=http://www.ananova.com/sport/story/sm_2484584.html |publisher=Ananova |date= |accessdate=2007-08-29}}</ref>

A possible loan deal to [[Ipswich_Town_F.C.|Ipswich Town]] fell through in early March 2008 with [[Jim_Magilton|Jim Magilton]], the Ipswich manager, left questioning Nugent's fitness.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/7265376.stm | title =Ipswich pull out of Nugent chase  | publisher = [[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]] | accessdate = 2008-03-05| date = 2008-03-04}}</ref>

Nugent appeared frequently for Portsmouth in the [[2007-08_FA_Cup|FA Cup]], scoring a goal in their initial Third Round tie against Ipswich Town.  His role culminated in coming on for John Utaka in the 69th minute of [[2008_FA_Cup_Final|the final]] against [[Cardiff_City_F.C.|Cardiff City]], eventually winning the trophy.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7393770.stm | title =Portsmouth 1–0 Cardiff match report  | publisher = [[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]] | accessdate = 2010-10-25| date = 2008-05-17 | first=Phil | last=McNulty}}</ref>
The next season and after 18 months at the club, Nugent scored his first [[FA_Premier_League|Premier League]] goal – against former manager Harry Redknapp at [[Tottenham_Hotspur_F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a 1–1 draw on 18 January 2009.<ref>{{Cite news |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/7837394.stm | title =Nugent 'proves point' to Redknapp | publisher = [[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]] | accessdate = 2009-01-19| date = 2009-01-19}}</ref> Two matches later he scored his second goal at [[Fulham_F.C.|Fulham]] and followed this up with his first league goal at [[Fratton_Park|Fratton Park]], scoring against [[Liverpool_F.C.|Liverpool]] on 7 February 2009.  However, these were to be Nugent's only top flight goals for Pompey.

On 5 August 2009, it was reported that Nugent had been involved in an alleged bust-up with fellow team mate [[Marc_Wilson_(Irish_footballer)|Marc Wilson]] during Portsmouth's pre-season trip to Portugal. Both players were sent home and subsequently fined two weeks' wages by the club.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/8185045.stm|title=Portsmouth duo fined over bust-up |date=2009-08-05|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-08-05}}</ref>

On 1 September 2009, it was reported that Nugent was in talks with [[Burnley_F.C.|Burnley]] about a loan move. Thirty minutes after the transfer window closed it was reported that Burnley had signed Nugent on a six-month-long loan deal with a view to a permanent move, subject to Premier League clearance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burnleyfootballclub.com/page/LatestHeadlines/0,,10413~1784902,00.html|title=Coyle Swoops for Striker Nugent|publisher=Burnley Football Club|date=2009-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-01}}</ref> On 12 September, he made his debut for ''the Clarets'' when he replaced [[Martin_Paterson|Martin Paterson]] 70 minutes into the game against [[Liverpool_F.C.|Liverpool]] at [[Anfield|Anfield]]. After coming on as a second half substitute for the Clarets on his home debut against [[Sunderland_AFC|Sunderland]], Nugent scored two goals, helping Burnley to a 3–1 win.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8255397.stm Burnley 3–1 Sunderland]</ref> Nugent scored his third goal of the season against Bolton.

On 30 January 2010, Nugent was told that he had to go back to [[Portsmouth_F.C.|Portsmouth]] and train with the club, but was then told to travel back to Burnley. After two days of travelling back and forth between Portsmouth and Burnley, new manager [[Brian_Laws|Brian Laws]] triggered an extension clause in Nugent's contract. Nugent signed another loan agreement with Burnley on 1 February which would keep him at the club on loan until June. He repaid the faith shown in him by Laws by opening the scoring in the home win against West Ham United on 6 February.

After failing to regotiate a permanent deal with Burnley or attract an alternative Premiership club, Nugent returned to newly relegated Portsmouth in the 2010–11 pre-season. He was a regular starter as a [[Outside_forward|left sided forward]].<ref>[http://www.pompeyrama.com/pompey-fc-squad-66.html]</ref> After an initial goal drought that saw him fail to hit the net until his goal in a 6–1 defeat of [[Leicester_City_F.C.|Leicester City]] on 24 September 2010, (his first for Pompey since February 2009), Nugent finished the season as Portsmouth's top goalscorer, scoring 14 goals in all competitions.

;李斯特城
On 5 July 2011, Nugent signed for Leicester City on a three-year deal after his contract with [[Portsmouth_F.C.|Portsmouth]] expired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nugent Agrees Foxes Deal|url=http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2387002,00.html|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> He made his competitive debut in a 1-0 win over [[Coventry_City_F.C.|Coventry City]] on 6 August 2011,<ref name="Coventry 	0-1 Leicester">{{cite|title = Coventry 0-1 Leicester|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_div_1/14352025.stm|publisher = BBC Sport|date = 6 Aug 2011|accessdate = 18 Aug 2011}}</ref> scoring his first goal for the club in a 2-1 defeat to [[Bristol_City_F.C.|Bristol City]] on 17 August.<ref name="Leicester  1-2  Bristol City">{{cite|title = Leicester   1 - 2   Bristol City|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14471679.stm|publisher = BBC Sport|date = 17 Aug 2011|accessdate = 18 Aug 2011}}</ref> On 18 February 2012, Nugent scored the winning goal to knock [[Premier_League|Premier League]] side [[Norwich_City|Norwich City]] out of the [[FA_Cup|FA Cup]] at [[Carrow_Road|Carrow Road]] and put Leicester through to the quarter finals.

===國家隊===
He made his debut for [[England_national_under-21_football_team|England U21s]] against [[Wales_national_under-21_football_team|Wales]] in February 2005.  He scored his first goal for the team on his debut, in the 2–2 draw with Moldova on 15 August 2006.  Teamed up front again with Arsenal's young [[Theo_Walcott|Theo Walcott]], he scored his second goal for England U21s in the 3–2 win over Switzerland on 6 September 2006 that advanced the team into the play-off round of the UEFA European Under-21 Championship. He scored his third goal for the U21s against [[Spain_national_football_team|Spain]] on 6 February 2007 in a 2–2 draw, [[Stuart_Pearce|Stuart Pearce]]'s first game as coach.

On 19 March 2007, following much speculation after [[Steve_McClaren|Steve McClaren]] confirmed he had been watching Nugent, David was called into the full England squad to replace the injured [[Darren_Bent|Darren Bent]] of [[Charlton_Athletic_F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].

On 28 March 2007, Nugent made his debut as a late substitute for [[England_national_football_team|England]] in a [[UEFA_Euro_2008|Euro 2008]] qualifying match against [[Andorra_national_football_team|Andorra]] in [[Barcelona|Barcelona]] and marked the occasion with a 93rd-minute goal after a [[Jermain_Defoe|Jermain Defoe]] shot. Nugent, in his post-match press interview, expressed genuine satisfaction over having accomplished a "1 Goal/1 Cap" national team record; Nugent is one of just three players to have exactly one substitute appearance and one goal for England, the others being [[Paul_Goddard|Paul Goddard]] and [[Francis_Jeffers|Francis Jeffers]].<ref>{{cite web | title=England's Single Goalscorers | work=England Football Online | url=http://www.englandfootballonline.com/TeamGoals/Goals_01.html | accessdate=May 16, 2007 }}</ref> Since then, Nugent has failed to secure another outing with England.

He was the first Preston player to play for the national team since [[Tom_Finney|Tom Finney]] some 49 years previously and the first England national team footballer from a club playing in [[The_Football_League|The Football League]] since [[David_James_(footballer)|David James]] of [[West_Ham_United_F.C.|West Ham]] in 2003. He was also the first [[The_Football_League|Football League]] outfield player since [[Michael_Gray_(footballer)|Michael Gray]] of [[Sunderland_A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in 1999.

In June 2007, he represented the Under-21s in the [[2007_UEFA_European_Under-21_Football_Championship|UEFA Under-21 Championship]] in the Netherlands.
