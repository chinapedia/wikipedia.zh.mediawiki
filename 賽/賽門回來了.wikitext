<!--==劇情==

===Events===
After Laser Wizard, Bufo, Forest Wizard, and—unwittingly—Ice King help a being named Bella Noche pass over into Wizard City, it reveals itself to be a creature of pure anti-magic. As such, the jewels from Ice King's crown are stripped of their magic, and Ice King reverts to his former self: Simon Petrikov (both voiced by [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]]). Simon, initially unaware of where he is, steals a magic carpet from Ash (voiced by [[Steve_Agee|Steve Agee]]), flies to the Ice Kingdom, and enters a hidden sanctum wherein elements of his previous life—such as books, artifacts, and his clothing—have been preserved. He phones Marceline, telling her to rush over and bring her stuffed teddy bear Hambo.

Marceline arrives with Finn and Jake, and the trio learn that Simon is dying since he is over a thousand years old. As such, he wants to create a portal to the past and apologize to his fiancée Betty for making her leave him. Hambo, filled with sentimentality, is the key to the portal. Marceline, realizing that Hambo will be destroyed but that she will enable her former protector to see the love of his life for one last time, agrees. The portal is opened just moments after Simon had first put on the ice crown and scared Betty. Simon from the future appears to her, explains the situation, and apologizes. Betty, realizing what has happened jumps through the portal and kisses Simon, only for the portal to close and Simon to collapse.

Betty instantaneously realizes that Simon needs magic in order to survive, so she places him on the magic carpet and flies it to Wizard City. On the way, Death (voiced by [[Miguel_Ferrer|Miguel Ferrer]]) appears to Simon in a vision, offering his one and only chance of escaping the curse of the crown. Simon refuses, and Betty attacks and eventually destroys Bella Noche. Simon reverts to Ice King, unaware of what happened. Later, he recounts the events to a captured Muscle Princess, while Betty—who survived the struggle with Bella Noche—watches sadly from a window and flies off on the magic carpet.
