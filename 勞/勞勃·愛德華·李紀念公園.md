'''勞勃·愛德華·李紀念公園'''（Robert E. Lee Memorial Park）位於美國[[馬里蘭州|馬里蘭州]][[巴爾的摩縣_(馬里蘭州)|巴爾的摩郡]]，圍繞羅蘭湖，占地415英畝<ref>http://www.baltimorecountymd.gov/Agencies/recreation/programdivision/naturearea/relpark/index.htm</ref>，由林地、濕地、岩石地形以及少見植物組成。附近有巴爾的摩輕軌的[[瀑布路輕軌站|佛爾斯路車站]]，輕軌路線穿過公園，將其分為北區（約占三分之二，為林地）與南區（約占三分之一，有野餐區、水壩、涼亭、抽水站）。本公園位於巴爾的摩市北邊界之外，但自1920年代起產權屬於巴爾的摩市，不過目前交由巴爾的摩郡管理經營。

The Lake was constructed in the late 1850s after the City's 1854 purchase of the assets of the privately owned Baltimore Water Company, (founded 1805), following a long political controversy about the company's failure to extend water lines and service into the then outlying areas of town after the most recent annexation of 1818 which moved the City's northern boundary to then-called Boundary Avenue (today's North Avenue). The "Beaver Dam" marble old pumping station on the eastern shore of the Lake contains a marble pedestal engraved with the dates and names of the pertinent official and contractors involved in its construction and completion in 1860–61, along with another stone tablet that used to lie at the dam's western end before its reconstruction in the mid-1990s by the City.

Further to the south, the City had also just purchased the former Lloyd Nicholas Rogers estate [[Druid_Hill_Park|"Druid Hill"]], first settled in the mid-1660s and with manor plantation houses reconstructed several times since, most recently in 1800 with what later became called the "Mansion House". It formed the third largest municipal landscaped park in the country (after [[Central_Park|Central Park]] in [[New_York_City|New York City]] and [[Fairmount_Park|Fairmount Park]] in [[Philadelphia|Philadelphia]]). Druid Lake was carved out, constructed and landscaped to add capacity to the newly expanded first municipal water supply system using the waters of the inter-connecting [[Jones_Falls|Jones Falls]] which flowed south through the central city to the Northwest Branch of the [[Patapsco_River|Patapsco River]] and the [[Helen_Delich_Bentley_Port_of_Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]]. The system of parks for the City of Baltimore along the various stream valleys with inter-connected landscaped boulevards or parkways was designed and laid out by the famous landscape architect and developer [[Frederick_Law_Olmsted|Frederick Law Olmsted]] and the company later established by his sons in two famous reports in 1904 and 1926, of which Lake Roland and its Dam formed and integral part.
