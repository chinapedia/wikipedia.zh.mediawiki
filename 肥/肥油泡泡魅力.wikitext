<!--==劇情==
After boasting to Turtle Princess (voiced by [[Steve_Little_(actor)|Steve Little]]) that no man is immune to her beauty, Lumpy Space Princess (voiced by [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]]) promises to seduce Finn and write a tell-all book about her experience. After convincing Finn and Jake to allow her to be their "adventure [[secretary|secretary]]", Lumpy Space Princess tries to woo Finn. However, most of what she interprets as signs of successful seduction are mundane aspects of Finn's [[altruistic|altruistic]] character, such as his willingness to fetch her old [[spaghetti|spaghetti]] for dinner.

The next day, Finn, Jake, and Lumpy Space Princess journey to the Mystery Mountains to investigate the Loch of Phantoms. After crossing the water, the trio enter into a cave system, where they find a mirror-like portal. Lumpy Space Princess accidentally falls through, wherein she is attacked by phantom versions of Finn. The real Finn, however, manages to break through using his sword, and Finn and Jake destroy the phantoms. Lumpy Space Princess, realizing that Finn is "beautiful on the inside" due to his altruism and heroic character, completely rewrites her book, much to Turtle Princess's excitement.

==Production==
"Gotcha!" was written and storyboarded by [[Cole_Sanchez|Cole Sanchez]] and [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]], from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]]. The episode was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Gotcha!| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Cole Sanchez & Rebecca Sugar (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=June 18, 2012| season = 4 | number = 12}}</ref> For inspiration, Sugar and Sanchez watched poorly made [[Romantic_comedy_film|romantic comedies]] with Osborne during their lunch breaks. While Sanchez felt that these movies were "inspiring", Sugar felt that they were "draining".<ref>Sanchez, Cole (Storyboard artist). 2014. "Gotcha!" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref><ref name=sugargotcha>Sugar, Rebecca (Storyboard artist). 2014. "Gotcha!" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> While the episode was being storyboarded, Ward was under stress because his family was in town. When Sugar explained that she wanted to make Lumpy Space Princess realize that she was attracted to Finn, Ward—being extremely stressed out—uncharacteristically protested, declaring: "They're both me. I'm Lumpy Space Princess and Finn."<ref name=wardgotcha/> He did not want any form of romance to come between the two characters due to his personal connection with them. However, when Ward was recording his lines, he felt that the story and dialogue was funny; he later noted he was just having an off day.<ref name=wardgotcha/>

The lake and the mirrors villains were ''[[Dungeons_&_Dragons|Dungeons & Dragons]]'' inspired, according to Ward. In the DVD commentary for the episode, he applauded Sugar's application of them.<ref name=wardgotcha/> She, in turn noted that she "love[s] mirror enemies … and doppelgänger enemies of all kinds."<ref name=sugargotcha/> During the scenes taking place inside the mirror room, Sugar made sure the mirrors were reflecting everything properly, which took extra work.<ref name=sugargotcha/> Because the word "lumps" were used over and over in the original storyboard, Ward and the crew began to think of new, unique colloquialism for Lumpy Space Princess to use when referring to her lumps. One of the words substituted was "cobras".<ref name=wardgotcha>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014. "Gotcha!" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref>

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "B". Sava felt that the episode's final line of dialogue—featuring Jake talleing Lumpy Space Princess that she's wearing garbage, only for Lumpy Space Princess to respond, "Gotcha!"—"perfectly encapsulates the tone of this episode".<ref name=avclubgotcha/> Lumpy Space Princess, according to Sava, is "adorable but simultaneously off-putting", which "translates to lots of laughs".<ref name=avclubgotcha/> Sava lauded Ward and Little's voice work, noting that "the repetition of their catchphrase 'Hey, girl!' is the episode’s best running gag, if only because Pendleton Ward and Steve Little give the characters such great voices."<ref name=avclubgotcha/> Finally, Sava was appreciative of the background music featured in the episode, writing, "The quick little bursts of music this week set the tone for the scenes really well, especially the [[Bon_Iver|Bon Iver]]-like final number as LSP has her final kinda-revelation."<ref name=avclubgotcha>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Adventure Time: 'Gotcha'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-gotcha-81193|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
