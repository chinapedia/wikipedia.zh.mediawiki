通常植物是为了适应干旱、严寒，对抗强蒸腾、强紫外线、昆虫及植食性动物等的危害而长出毛状体；其可截留水滴、隔绝低温、或使掠食者无法吞咽。植物毛状体特征各异，在植物的种类和单个植物的器官之间都有不同。毛状体按照这些特征进行分类。一些决定性的特征包括：

===Aerial surface hairs===
'''Trichomes''' on plants are [[表皮_(植物)|epidermal]] outgrowths of various kinds. The terms '''emergences''' or '''[[刺|prickles]]''' refer to outgrowths that involve more than the epidermis. This distinction is not always easily applied (see {{tsl|en|Wait-a-minute tree||}}). Also, there are ''nontrichomatous'' epidermal cells that protrude from the surface.{{such as|date=April 2018}}

A common type of trichome is a '''hair'''. Plant hairs may be [[单细胞生物|unicellular]] or [[多細胞生物|multicellular]], branched or unbranched. Multicellular hairs may have one or several layers of cells. Branched hairs can be ''dendritic'' (tree-like) as in {{tsl|en|kangaroo paw||}} (''{{tsl|en|Anigozanthos||}}''), ''tufted'', or ''stellate'' (star-shaped), as in ''[[拟南芥|拟南芥]]''.

Another common type of trichome is the '''scale''' or '''peltate hair''', that has a plate or shield-shaped cluster of cells attached directly to the surface or borne on a stalk of some kind. Common examples are the leaf scales of [[凤梨科|bromeliads]] such as the [[菠蘿|菠蘿]], ''[[杜鵑花屬|杜鵑花屬]]'' and sea buckthorn (''[[沙棘|沙棘]]'').

Any of the various types of hairs may be '''{{vanchor|glandular}}''', producing some kind of secretion, such as the essential oils produced by [[薄荷屬|mint]]s and many other members of the family [[唇形科|唇形科]].

Many terms are used to describe the surface appearance of plant organs, such as [[茎|stems]] and [[葉|leaves]], referring to the presence, form and appearance of trichomes. Examples include:
* '''glabrous''', '''glabrate''' – lacking hairs or trichomes; surface smooth
* '''hirsute''' – coarsely hairy
* '''hispid''' – having bristly hairs
* '''articulate''' – simple pluricellular-uniseriate hairs
* '''downy''' – having an almost wool-like covering of long hairs
* '''pilose''' – pubescent with long, straight, soft, spreading or erect hairs
* '''puberulent''' – minutely pubescent; having fine, short, usually erect, hairs
* '''短柔毛''' – bearing hairs or trichomes of any type
* '''strigillose''' – minutely strigose
* '''strigose''' – having straight hairs all pointing in more or less the same direction as along a margin or midrib
* '''tomentellous''' – minutely tomentose
* '''tomentose''' – covered with dense, matted, woolly hairs
* '''villosulous''' – minutely villous
* '''villous''' – having long, soft hairs, often curved, but not matted

The size, form, density and location of hairs on plants are extremely variable in their presence across [[物种|物种]] and even within a species on different plant organs. Several basic functions or advantages of having surface hairs can be listed. It is likely that in many cases, hairs interfere with the feeding of at least some small [[植食性动物|植食性动物]]s and, depending upon [[剛度|剛度]] and [[应激性|应激性]] to the [[腭|腭]], large herbivores as well. Hairs on plants growing in areas subject to [[霜|霜]] keep the frost away from the living surface cells. In windy locations, hairs break up the flow of air across the plant surface, reducing [[蒸腾作用|蒸腾作用]]. Dense coatings of hairs reflect [[太阳光|太阳光]], protecting the more delicate tissues underneath in hot, dry, open habitats. In addition, in locations where much of the available moisture comes from {{tsl|en|fog drip||}}, hairs appear to enhance this process by increasing the surface area on which water droplets can accumulate.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

=== Glandular trichomes ===
Glandular trichomes have been vastly studied, even though they are only found on about 30% of plants. Their function is to secrete metabolites for the plant. Some of these metabolites include:

* [[类萜|类萜]]s, which have many functions in the plant related to growth and development<ref>{{Citation|last=Tholl|first=Dorothea|chapter=Biosynthesis and Biological Functions of Terpenoids in Plants|date=2015|pages=63–106|editor-last=Schrader|editor-first=Jens|series=Advances in Biochemical Engineering/Biotechnology|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/10_2014_295|pmid=25583224|isbn=9783319201078|editor2-last=Bohlmann|editor2-first=Jörg|title=Biotechnology of Isoprenoids|volume=148}}</ref>

=== Non-glandular trichomes ===
Non-glandular trichomes are important for plant protection against UV light.<ref name=":02"/>

The model plant, ''Cistus salvifolius,'' is found in areas of high-light stress and poor soil conditions, along the Mediterranean coasts. It contains non-glandular, stellate and dendritic trichomes that have the ability to synthesize and store polyphenols that both affect absorbance of radiation and plant desiccation. These trichomes also contain acetylated flavonoids, which can absorb UV-B, and non-acetylated flavonoids, which absorb the longer wavelength of UV-A. In non-glandular trichomes, the only role of flavonoids is to block out the shortest wavelengths to protect the plant, which differs from in glandular trichomes.<ref name=":02"/>

==== Polyphenols ====
Non-glandular trichomes in the genus ''Cistus'' were found to contain presences of ellagitannins, [[糖苷|糖苷]]s, and [[山柰酚|山柰酚]] derivatives. The ellagitannins have the main purpose of helping adapt in times of nutrient-limiting stress.<ref name=":02"/>

== Trichome and root hair development ==
Both trichomes and [[根毛|根毛]]s, the [[假根|假根]]s of many [[维管植物|维管植物]]s, are lateral outgrowths of a single cell of the epidermal layer. Root hairs form from '''trichoblasts''', the hair-forming cells on the epidermis of a plant [[根|根]]. Root hairs vary between 5 and 17 micrometers in diameter, and 80 to 1,500 micrometers in length (Dittmar, cited in Esau, 1965). Root hairs can survive for two to three weeks and then die off. At the same time new root hairs are continually being formed at the top of the root. This way, the root hair coverage stays the same. It is therefore understandable that repotting must be done with care, because the root hairs are being pulled off for the most part. This is why planting out may cause plants to wilt.
[[File:Red_Trichomes_of_the_roses.jpg|thumb]]
The genetic control of patterning of trichomes and roots hairs shares similar control mechanisms. Both processes involve a core of related [[通用转录因子|transcription factors]] that control the initiation and development of the epidermal outgrowth. Activation of genes that encode specific protein transcription factors (named GLABRA1 (GL1), GLABRA3 (GL3) and TRANSPARENT [[種子|TESTA]] GLABRA1 (TTG1)) are the major regulators of cell fate to produce trichomes or root hairs.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Schellmann|first1=S.|last2=Schnittger|first2=A.|last3=Kirik|first3=V.|last4=Wada|first4=T.|last5=Okada|first5=K.|last6=Beermann|first6=A.|last7=Thumfahrt|first7=J.|last8=Jürgens|first8=G.|last9=Hülskamp|first9=M.|date=2002-10-01|title=TRIPTYCHON and CAPRICE mediate lateral inhibition during trichome and root hair patterning in Arabidopsis|url=http://embojnl.embopress.org/content/21/19/5036|journal=The EMBO Journal|language=en|volume=21|issue=19|pages=5036–5046|doi=10.1093/emboj/cdf524|issn=0261-4189|pmid=12356720|pmc=129046}}</ref> When these genes are activated in a leaf epidermal cell, the formation of a trichrome is initiated within that cell. GL1, GL3. and TTG1 also activate negative regulators, which serve to inhibit trichrome formation in neighboring cells. This system controls the spacing of trichomes on the leaf surface. Once trichome are developed they may divide or branch.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Schellmann|first1=Swen|last2=Hulskamp|first2=Martin|date=2004-09-01|title=Epidermal differentiation: trichomes in Arabidopsis as a model system|journal=The International Journal of Developmental Biology|language=en|volume=49|issue=5–6|pages=579–584|doi=10.1387/ijdb.051983ss|pmid=16096966|issn=0214-6282|doi-access=free}}</ref> In contrast, root hairs only rarely branch. During the formation of trichomes and root hairs, many enzymes are regulated. For example, just prior to the root hair development, there is a point of elevated {{tsl|en|phosphorylase||}} activity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dosier|first1=Larry W.|last2=Riopel|first2=J. L.|date=1977|title=Differential Enzyme Activity During Trichoblast Differentiation in Elodea canadensis|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=64|issue=9|pages=1049–1056|doi=10.2307/2442160|jstor=2442160}}</ref>

Many of what scientists know about trichome development comes from the model organism ''Arabidopsis thaliana'', because their trichomes are simple, unicellular, and non-glandular. The development pathway is regulated by three transcription factors: R2R3 MYB, basic helix-loop-helix, and WD40 repeat. The three groups of TFs form a trimer complex (MBW) and activate the expression of products downstream, which activates trichome formation. However, just MYBs alone act as an inhibitor by forming a negative complex.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Yuan|first1=Ling|last2=Singh|first2=Sanjay Kumar|last3=Patra|first3=Barunava|last4=Pattanaik|first4=Sitakanta|date=2014|title=An overview of the gene regulatory network controlling trichome development in the model plant, Arabidopsis|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|language=en|volume=5|pages=259|doi=10.3389/fpls.2014.00259|pmid=25018756|pmc=4071814|issn=1664-462X}}</ref>

=== Phytohormones ===
Plant phytohormones have an effect on the growth and response of plants to environmental stimuli. Some of these phytohormones are involved in trichome formation, which include gibberellic acid (GA), cytokinins (CK), and jasmonic acids (JA).<ref name=":1" />

GA stimulates growth of trichomes by stimulating GLABROUS1 (GL1).

However, both SPINDLY and DELLA proteins repress the effects of GA, so less of these proteins create more trichomes.

Some other phytohormones that promote growth of trichomes include brassinosteroids, ethylene, and salicylic acid. This was understood by conducting experiments with mutants that has little to no amounts of each of these substances. In every case, there was less trichome formation on both plant surfaces, as well as incorrect formation of the trichomes present.<ref name=":1" />

==Significance for taxonomy==
The type, presence and absence and location of trichomes are important diagnostic characters in plant identification and plant taxonomy.<ref name=Davis>{{cite book|last1=Davis|first1=P.H.|author2-link=Heywood, Vernon Hilton|last2=Heywood|first2=V.H.|year=1963|title=Principles of angiosperm taxonomy|url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofangi0000unse|publisher=Van Nostrandpage|location=Princeton, New Jersey|page=[https://archive.org/details/principlesofangi0000unse/page/154 154] |author1-link=Davis, Peter Hadland}}</ref> In forensic examination, plants such as ''[[大麻草|大麻草]]'' can be identified by microscopic examination of the  trichomes.<ref name=Bhatia>{{cite journal|first1=R.Y.P.|last1=Bhatia|first2=S.|last2=Raghavan|first3=K.V.S.|last3=Rao|first4=V.N.|last4=Prasad|title=Forensic examination of leaf and leaf fragments in fresh and dried conditions.|journal=Journal of the Forensic Science Society|volume=13|issue=3|year=1973|pages=183–190|doi=10.1016/S0015-7368(73)70794-5 |pmid=4774149}}</ref><ref name=UNODC>{{cite book|author=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|title=Recommended Methods for the Identification and Analysis of Cannabis and Cannabis Products (Revised and updated)|year=2009|publisher=United Nations|location=New York|pages=30–32|isbn=9789211482423 }}</ref> Although trichomes are rarely found preserved in [[化石|化石]]s, trichome bases are regularly found and, in some cases, their cellular structure is important for identification.

=== ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' trichome classification ===
''Arabidopsis thaliana'' trichomes are classified as being aerial, epidermal, unicellular, tubular structures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Maithur|first1=Jaideep|last2=Chua|first2=Nam-Hai|date=April 2000|title=Microtubule Stabilization Leads to Growth Reorientation in Arabidopsis Trichomes|url=http://www.plantcell.org/content/plantcell/12/4/465.full.pdf|journal=Plant Cell|volume=12|issue=4|pages=465–477|doi=10.1105/tpc.12.4.465|pmid=10760237|pmc=139846}}</ref>

== Significance for plant molecular biology ==
In the model plant ''[[拟南芥|拟南芥]]'', trichome formation is initiated by the GLABROUS1 protein. [[基因剔除|Knockouts]] of the corresponding gene lead to glabrous plants.

==Uses==
[[菜豆|Bean]] leaves have been used historically to trap {{tsl|en|Bed bug (insect)||bedbug}}s in houses in [[东欧|东欧]]. The trichomes on the bean leaves capture the insects by impaling their feet ([[腿_(节肢动物)|tarsi]]). The leaves would then be destroyed.<ref name=Szyndler>{{cite journal|author1=Szyndler, M.W. |author2=Haynes, K.F. |author3=Potter, M.F. |author4=Corn, R.M. |author5=Loudon, C. |year=2013|title=Entrapment of bed bugs by leaf trichomes inspires microfabrication of biomimetic surfaces|journal=Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume=10|issue=83|issn=1742-5662|doi=10.1098/rsif.2013.0174 |pmid=23576783 |page=20130174|pmc=3645427}}</ref>

Trichomes are an essential part of nest building for the {{tsl|en|Anthidium manicatum||European wool carder bee}} (''Anthidium manicatum''). This bee species incorporates trichomes into their nests by scraping them off of plants and using them as a lining for their nest cavities.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eltz|first1=Thomas|last2=Küttner|first2=Jennifer|last3=Lunau|first3=Klaus|last4=Tollrian|first4=Ralph|title=Plant secretions prevent wasp parasitism in nests of wool-carder bees, with implications for the diversification of nesting materials in Megachilidae|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution|date=6 January 2015|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fevo.2014.00086|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Defense==
Plants may use trichomes in order to deter herbivore attacks via physical and/or chemical means, e.g. in specialized, {{tsl|en|stinging plant||stinging hair}}s of ''[[蕁麻屬|蕁麻屬]]'' (Nettle) species that deliver inflammatory chemicals such as [[組織胺|組織胺]]. Studies on trichomes have been focused towards crop protection, which is the result of deterring herbivores (Brookes et al. 2016).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karley|first=A|year=2016|title=Exploiting physical defence traits for crop protection: leaf trichomes of Rubus idaeus have deterrent effects on spider mites but not aphids.|journal=Annals of Applied Biology|volume=168|issue=2|pages=159–172|via=Academic Search Premier|doi=10.1111/aab.12252}}</ref> However, some organisms have developed mechanisms to resist the effects of trichomes. The larvae of ''{{tsl|en|Heliconius charithonia||}}'', for example, are able to physically free themselves from trichomes, are able to bite off trichomes, and are able to form [[丝绸|丝绸]] blankets in order to navigate the leaves better.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cardoso | first1 = Márcio Z | year = 2008 | title = Ecology, Behavior and Binomics: Herbivore Handling of a Plant's Trichome: The Case of Heliconius Charithonia (L.)

=== Stinging trichomes ===

Stinging trichomes vary in their morphology and distribution between species, however similar effects on large herbivores implies they serve similar functions. In areas susceptible to herbivory, higher densities of stinging trichomes were observed. In ''Urtica'', the stinging trichomes induce a painful sensation lasting for hours upon human contact. This sensation has been attributed as a defense mechanism against large animals and small invertebrates, and plays a role in defense supplementation via secretion of metabolites. Studies suggest that this sensation involves a rapid release of toxin (such as histamine) upon contact and penetration via the globular tips of said trichomes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fu | first1 = H.
