[[File:NYCS_207th_St_Yard.jpg|thumb]]
'''207街车辆段'''（{{lang-en|207th Street Yard}}）位于曼哈顿上城，[[Harlem_River|Harlem River]] north of the [[University_Heights_Bridge|University Heights Bridge]]. It serves as the home yard for the [[R32_(New_York_City_Subway_car)|R32]]s assigned to the {{NYCS|C}} train.

The 207th Street Shop is one of two heavy overhaul shops in the New York City Subway system (the other being the Coney Island Yard in Brooklyn) and provides overhaul and rebuilding of most [[A_Division_(New_York_City_Subway)|A Division]] cars as well as some [[B_Division_(New_York_City_Subway)|B Division]] rolling stock.

The yard also stores cars that are being retired or awaiting scrapping and restores cars designated for the [[New_York_Transit_Museum|New York Transit Museum]].

South of the yard, connecting tracks lead to the [[IND_Eighth_Avenue_Line|IND Eighth Avenue Line]]. A separate connecting track and flyover leads to the [[IRT_Broadway_–_Seventh_Avenue_Line|IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line]].

===Canarsie Yard===
[[File:Canarsie_yard_jeh.JPG|thumb]]
The '''Canarsie Yard''' (also known as '''AY Yard''' from its [[telegraph|telegraphy letters]]) is located on the south end of the [[BMT_Canarsie_Line|BMT Canarsie Line]] adjacent to [[Canarsie_–_Rockaway_Parkway_(BMT_Canarsie_Line)|Canarsie – Rockaway Parkway]]. It is the primary layup yard for the '''{{NYCS|L}}''' train and hosts the only car wash for the entire BMT Eastern Division, washing trains for the '''{{NYCS|J}}''', '''{{NYCS|L}}''', '''{{NYCS|M}}''' and '''{{NYCS|Z}}''' services. Signals were installed in 2003 in conjunction with the [[Automation_of_the_New_York_City_Subway|BMT Canarsie Line automation]] project. This greatly increases the safety of train movements in the yard, as the '''{{NYCS|L}}''' train has some of the fastest growing ridership in the system.

===Church Avenue Yard===
The '''Church Avenue Yard''' is an underground [[rail_yard|rail yard]] on the [[IND_Culver_Line|IND Culver Line]], used to store trains for the '''{{NYCS|G}}''' service. It is composed of four tracks directly under the four main line tracks above.  This yard is directly connected through the IND [[Church_Avenue_(IND_Culver_Line)|Church Avenue]] station which presently is the terminus for "G" service.  At least one of the yard's inner-most 4-tracks is in continuous use to turn-back equipment to the opposite direction.  There are two ramps between each local and express track south of Church Avenue station for access. Each track can hold one full-length train between the [[bumper_block|bumper block]]s and the crossovers.

===Coney Island Complex===
[[File:CI_Yard_Entrance_jeh.jpg|thumb]]

The '''Coney Island Complex''' is the largest [[rapid_transit|rapid transit]] yard in the state of New York. Located in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn]], [[New_York|New York]], it covers {{convert|75|acre|m2}} and operates [[24/7|24/7]].
[[File:Coney_Island_Complex_Outside.JPG|thumb]]
[[File:Coney_Island_Complex_Workshop.JPG|thumb]]
{{Commons category|Coney Island Complex}}

The complex was built in 1926 on former [[marshland|marshland]]s that, along with [[Coney_Island_Creek|Coney Island Creek]], formerly separated [[Coney_Island|Coney Island]] from the main body of Brooklyn. Much of this land had originally been proposed for use as a [[ship_canal|ship canal]] and [[port|port]] facility.

Regular scheduled maintenance is performed here for a fleet of nearly 800 cars serving the '''{{NYCS|B}}''', '''{{NYCS|G}}''', '''{{NYCS|N}}''', '''{{NYCS|Q}}''' and '''[[Franklin_Avenue_Shuttle|Franklin Avenue Shuttle]]''' trains. The shop facility along with 207th St. does heavy maintenance and overhaul for every one of the approximately 6,000 cars in the subway system, including the [[Staten_Island_Railway|Staten Island Railway]].

In addition to heavy maintenance facilities and track facilities for cars undergoing maintenance and overhaul, the complex includes three related railroad storage yards. The main yard facility, known as "Coney Island Yard," includes direct connections to the adjacent [[BMT_Sea_Beach_Line|BMT Sea Beach Line]] ({{NYCS Sea Beach}} train) and a two-track elevated structure to the [[BMT_West_End_Line|BMT West End Line]] ({{NYCS West End}} train). The main yard also serves trains on the [[BMT_Brighton_Line|BMT Brighton Line]] ({{NYCS Brighton}} trains) via tracks C & D (aka 3 & 4) of [[Coney_Island_–_Stillwell_Avenue_(New_York_City_Subway)|Coney Island – Stillwell Avenue]] station. The adjacent but separate Culver (or "City") Yard connects to the [[IND_Culver_Line|IND Culver Line]] ({{NYCS Culver IND south}} train) at the eastern border of the yard complex. Another yard, "Stillwell Yard," used mainly for off-peak train storage, is located across the Sea Beach Line from the main yard complex in a "V" between the divergent Sea Beach and West End Lines.

In addition to the maintenance shop and yards, there is a Health Center (gym) for Transit Authority employees and a firing range for the [[New_York_City_Police_Department|New York City Police Department]] (NYPD). The range was originally built for the [[New_York_City_Transit_Police|New York City Transit Police]] Department, which was merged with the NYPD in 1995.

The [[Coney_Island_Yard_Electric_Motor_Repair_Shop|Coney Island Yard Electric Motor Repair Shop]] and [[Coney_Island_Yard_Gatehouse|Coney Island Yard Gatehouse]] were listed on the [[National_Register_of_Historic_Places|National Register of Historic Places]] in 2006.<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2009a}}</ref>

The '''Concourse Yard''' is located in northern [[Bronx|Bronx]] near 205th Street and Jerome Avenue. This yard is home to all cars assigned to the '''{{NYCS|D}}''' trains and are maintained at this yard, although many trains assigned to the '''{{NYCS|B}}''' and '''{{NYCS|4}}''' services are stored here as well. Connecting tracks lead north from the yard to the [[IND_Concourse_Line|IND Concourse Line]] and south to the [[IRT_Jerome_Avenue_Line|IRT Jerome Avenue Line]]. Concourse Yard is spanned across its middle by Bedford Park Boulevard West, and at its northern end by a 205th Street viaduct.  The Jerome Yard used by the IRT Jerome Avenue Line lies to the north of 205th Street.

The '''Concourse Yard Entry Buildings''' and '''Concourse Yard Substation''' were listed on the [[National_Register_of_Historic_Places|National Register of Historic Places]] in 2006.<ref name="nris"/> The former consists of two, three-story brick buildings with only the top story visible from the street that are built next to one another to form a [[gate|gate]]way to the Concourse Yard.

It is located at the junction of the [[BMT_Canarsie_Line|Canarsie]] and [[BMT_Jamaica_Line|Jamaica Line]]s near the intersection of Broadway and Jamaica Avenue in [[East_New_York,_Brooklyn|East New York, Brooklyn]]. A separate part of the facility houses the [[East_New_York_Bus_Depot|East New York Bus Depot]], formerly a [[tram|trolley]] depot. The yard is entirely equipped with hand-operated switches. Only the Fresh Pond Yard and 36th–38th Street Yard share this characteristic. 

Portions of the yard date back to 1885 and the [[Lexington_Avenue_Elevated|Lexington Avenue Elevated]] and the yard predates the rebuilding of nearby [[Broadway_Junction_(BMT_Jamaica_Line)|Broadway Junction]], which was formerly known as '''Manhattan Junction''' or '''East New York Loop'''.

The yard and its main lead configuration remained the same before and after the extensive elevated line rebuilding nearby, but additional track and structure was built, so that, at its peak, East New York Yard had direct connections to the Broadway Elevated going west, [[BMT_Jamaica_Line|Jamaica Line]] going east, [[BMT_Canarsie_Line|Canarsie Line]] going east, and [[Kings_County_Elevated_Railway|Fulton Street Elevated]] both east and west.

===Pitkin Yard===
[[File:Pitkin_Av_Yard_jeh.JPG|thumb]]
The '''Pitkin Yard''' is located in [[East_New_York,_Brooklyn|East New York, Brooklyn]]. It holds the Pitkin Shops, which maintain the [[R46_(New_York_City_Subway_car)|R46]]s used on the '''{{NYCS|A}}''' train and [[Rockaway_Park_Shuttle|Rockaway Park Shuttle]]. Some [[R32_(New_York_City_Subway_car)|R32]]s used on the '''{{NYCS|C}}''' train are also stored here.

Track connections from the yard connect both railroad north to [[Euclid_Avenue_(IND_Fulton_Street_Line)|Euclid Avenue]] and railroad south past [[Grant_Avenue_(IND_Fulton_Street_Line)|Grant Avenue]] on the [[IND_Fulton_Street_Line|IND Fulton Street Line]]. This allows trains to be added or removed from service in either direction. {{Coord|40|40|21|N|73|51|54|W|type:railwaystation_region:US-NY|name=Pitkin Yard}}

===Rockaway Park Yard===
[[File:Rockaway_Yard_east_jeh.jpg|thumb]]
'''Rockaway Park Yard''' is located in [[Rockaway_Park,_Queens|Rockaway Park, Queens]]. It is a layup yard for the [[R46_(New_York_City_Subway_car)|R46]]s on the [[Rockaway_Park_Shuttle|Rockaway Park Shuttle]] and '''{{NYCS|A}}''' train, although they are primarily maintained at the [[Pitkin_Yard|Pitkin Yard]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn]]. [[R40A_(New_York_City_Subway_car)|R40A]] #4392-93 are used for school training in this yard. 
[[File:Rockway_Yard_west_jeh.jpg|thumb]]
This yard is adjacent to [[Rockaway_Park_–_Beach_116th_Street_(IND_Rockaway_Line)|Rockaway Park – Beach 116th Street]]. Like the [[IND_Rockaway_Line|IND Rockaway Line]] itself, the Rockaway Yard was originally a yard for the [[Rockaway_Beach_Branch|Rockaway Beach Branch]] of the [[Long_Island_Rail_Road|Long Island Rail Road]]. It included a water tower, a roundhouse, and an elevated loop track for [[Brooklyn_Rapid_Transit|Brooklyn Rapid Transit]] trains.

===36th-38th Street Yard===
[[File:BMT_36-38_St_yard_jeh.JPG|thumb]]
The '''36th–38th Street Yard''' is located between Fifth and Seventh Avenues in [[Sunset_Park,_Brooklyn|Sunset Park, Brooklyn]], adjacent to the [[Bus_depots_of_the_New_York_City_Transit_Authority#Jackie_Gleason_Depot|Jackie Gleason Bus Depot]]. This yard is not normally used for  revenue-service train maintenance, though some trains for the '''{{NYCS|R}}''' service are stored here. Its primary function is to store diesel and electrically powered maintenance-of-way and other non-revenue service rolling stock. It is also used to transfer trash from garbage collector trains to trucks via platforms inside the yard just south of 37th Street.

This southern part of the yard was formerly the center of the [[South_Brooklyn_Railway|South Brooklyn Railway]], which extended from [[Bush_Terminal|Bush Terminal]] through the north part of the yard, then down Gravesend Avenue and into the [[Coney_Island_Complex|Coney Island Yard]]. The yard is entirely equipped with hand-operated switches. Only [[Fresh_Pond_Yard|Fresh Pond Yard]] and [[East_New_York_Yard|East New York Yard]] share this characteristic.

===Linden Shops===
'''Linden Shops''' is a track shop, where track switches and other components are assembled. It has track connections to the [[IRT_New_Lots_Line|IRT New Lots Line]] and [[BMT_Canarsie_Line|BMT Canarsie Line]], but no [[third_rail|third rail]], restricting the facility to diesel-powered trains only. There is also a track connection to the [[Long_Island_Rail_Road|Long Island Rail Road]]'s [[Bay_Ridge_Branch|Bay Ridge Branch]]. This connection is one of two from the subway to the mainline United States rail network (the [[BMT_West_End_Line|BMT West End Line]] is the other).
