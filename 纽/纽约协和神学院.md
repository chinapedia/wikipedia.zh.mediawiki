As liberalism lost ground to conservatism after the 1960s, UTS ran into financial difficulties, and shrank significantly. Eventually, the school agreed to lease some of its buildings to Columbia University and to transfer ownership of and responsibility for the Burke Library to Columbia. These agreements helped stabilize the school's finances, which had been hobbled by increasing library costs and the need for substantial campus repairs. -->
