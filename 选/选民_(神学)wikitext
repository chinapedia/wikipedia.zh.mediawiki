'''选民'''，即'''天選之人'''，是指「被神所拣选的人」。常常被視為是神挑選，实现[[天命|天命]]（例如在地上充当[[先知|先知]]）的個人，甚至可以是一個受神喜愛的族群。[[亞伯拉罕宗教|亞伯拉罕宗教]]中，[[犹太人|犹太人]]、[[基督徒|基督徒]]、[[回教徒|回教徒]]（[[穆斯林|穆斯林]]），都声称自己接受了神的启示，认为自己是神的选民。

古時[[道教|道教]]有類似的思想，稱之[[種民|種民]]或[[善種人|善種人]]。

== 啟示  ==
许多宗教相信神向[[先知|先知]]启示了一些信息。[[犹太教|犹太教]]、[[基督宗教|基督宗教]]和[[回教|回教]]的大部分教派都教导说，他们信仰的道路是使人得到拯救的不二法門。[[印度教|印度教]]、[[佛教|佛教]]、[[锡克教|锡克教]]、犹太教、基督宗教、回教的少数教派，则相信其他宗教的信徒也可以通过自己的方式獲得[[永生|永生]]。

== 民族优越感 ==
选民的观念有时会带来民族优越感，批评者认为这一观念带来了[[文化帝国主义|文化帝国主义]]、[[种族主义|种族主义]]和[[排外主义|排外主义]]。不过基督徒和犹太人争辩说，选民的身份带来的更多的是责任和奉献，而不是特权。

《[[旧约圣经|旧约圣经]]·[[出埃及记|出埃及记]]》中提到，[[犹太人|犹太人]]是神特选的子民，将来救世主[[弥赛亚|弥赛亚]]要降临，拯救犹太人。神向[[摩西|摩西]]传达《[[摩西五经|摩西五经]]》，因此犹太人还享有“[[神的道|神的道]]”或“[[摩西律法|天啟的律法]]”。

[[南北戰爭|南北戰爭]]時，主要由基督徒构成的[[美国|美国]][[奴隶主|奴隶主]]以自己的觀點和經歷认为自己是「神所选定」，可以擁有奴隸，讓社會更加進步。与此相反，同样主要由基督徒构成的[[废奴主义|废奴主义]]者，也认为自己是神所选定给[[奴隶|奴隶]]带来自由和平等的权利。

[[二次大戰|二次大戰]]時，[[白人至上主义|白人至上主义]]者相信[[雅利安人|雅利安人]]（Aryan race）是「神所选定」而优越的，支配其他低等民族是他们的使命，包括[[納粹黨|納粹黨]]。亞洲，[[神道教|神道教]]教义中日本人是[[天照大神|天照大神]]所造，是神选民族，日本是神造国家。

许多宗教和慈善组织认为自己是「神所选定」来照顾病人和受苦的人。

== 犹太教 ==
{{Main|作为选民的犹太人}}
在[[犹太教|犹太教]]中，相信[[犹太人|犹太人]]是被上主[[雅威|雅威]]（[[四字神名|YHVH]]）拣选与他立约的选民。犹太教的选民观念首先见于《[[摩西五经|摩西五经]]》，特别用以指[[犹太人|犹太人]]（希伯来人、以色列人）。

== 基督宗教 ==
<!-- {{main|Supersessionism}} -->
過往的基督信仰认为基督徒已经取代[[犹太人|犹太人]]（希伯來人）成为神的选民。根据这种观点，对以色列的拣选最终将通过[[耶稣基督|耶稣基督]]的教训来实现，犹太人拒绝基督信仰，不承认[[耶稣|耶稣]]是[[弥赛亚|弥赛亚]]，更不是[[上帝的儿子|上帝的儿子]]，就不再拥有选民资格。基督取代论者引《[[新約聖經|新約聖經]]》来支持他们的观点，说基督徒已取代犹太人成为神的选民和亚伯拉罕的后裔：“没有犹太人或希腊人，没有为奴的或自主的，也没有男和女，因为你们众人在基督耶稣裏，都是一了。你们既属于基督，就是亚伯拉罕的后裔，是照着应许为后嗣了。”<ref>加拉太书3:28-29</ref>

=== 加尔文主义 ===
[[加爾文主義|加爾文主義]]不同於其他[[基督宗教|基督宗教]]宗派的特點，就是極其強調「[[預選說|預選說]]」，[[加爾文|加爾文]]繼承了[[奧古斯丁|奧古斯丁]]的理念，認為人是否能夠信奉[[基督|基督]]，信奉基督之後是否[[得救|得救]]，都是上天註定好的，只有[[天選之人|天選之人]]能夠得[[永生|永生]]，其他人則永遠墮入地獄，[[基督之死|基督之死]]是[[限定的代贖|為那些天選之人贖罪]]，不是為世上所有的人。天選之人將獲得[[永生|永生]]，且[[不可抗拒的恩典|不可能抗拒上帝的救恩]]，天選之人[[一旦得救永恆得救|一旦得救永恆得救]]，不可能墮落；但未蒙天選的人則會永墮[[地獄|地獄]]，而且上帝讓人升入天堂是[[無條件的揀選|不需條件]]，亦不需要[[行善|行善]]積德，更不須購買[[贖罪券|贖罪券]]。此《[[預選說|預選說]]》如一顆拋入池塘的石頭，在[[宗教改革|宗教改革]]中，無論[[舊教|舊教]]或[[新教|新教]]都非常認真回應《預選說》，《[[預選說|預選說]]》幾乎攪亂了整個[[基督教世界|基督教世界]]。為了証明自己是天選之人，喀爾文派不但不會要求信徒遠離俗世，反而鼓勵信徒努力賺錢，並認為賺得大錢是一種表徵，証實自己是天選之人，且賺錢是榮耀神的行為，這促進了資本主義的發展。<ref>黃欣萍《基督新教簡史》衛道出版社</ref>

=== 基督宗教非传统教派 ===

==== 基督复临安息日会 ====
{{Main|{{link-en|餘民|Remnant}}|三位天使之信息}}
[[基督复临安息日会|基督复临安息日会]]认为，安息日会信徒就是启示录12章17节所说，上帝在[[末日|末日]]时期选召的“守神诫命、为耶稣作见证”的餘民（Remnant），向世界传扬启示录14章的“三位天使之信息”（three angels' messages）。

==== 後期聖徒運動 ====
在[[後期聖徒運動|後期聖徒運動]]（[[摩門教|摩門教]]）中，认为所有加入教會都是与神立约、或被选召的人。<!-- they have accepted the name of 耶稣基督的. This acceptance of entering the covenant is initiated by baptism. In contrast to [[supersessionism|supersessionism]], Latter Day Saints do not dispute the "chosen" status of the Jewish people. In LDS doctrine all people who have ever lived will have the ability to enter into this covenant during the Millennium.  Mormon eschatology holds that Jews, as a chosen people, will ultimately accept 基督教(See Jeremiah 31:31-34).  

Mormon doctrine teaches that Mormons are "The kin blood of the Jews."   Every practicing LDS member receives a [[patriarchal_blessing|patriarchal blessing]] that reveals their lineage in the House of Israel. This lineage may be blood related or through "adoption;" therefore, a child may not necessarily share the lineage of her parents (but will still be a member of the [[tribes_of_Israel|tribes of Israel]]).  It is a widely held belief that most members of the faith are in the [[tribe_of_Ephraim|tribe of Ephraim]] or the [[tribe_of_Manasseh|tribe of Manasseh]]. -->

==== 世界和平統一家庭聯合會 ====
世界和平統一家庭聯合會（[[統一教|統一教]]）[[文鲜明|文鲜明]]教导说，[[韩国|韩国]]是蒙神拣选的国度，负有神圣的使命。<!--  "chosen by God to be the birthplace of the leading figure of the age", --><ref>[http://www.tparents.org/Library/Unification/Publications/ICC-Q-A/ICC-05.htm]</ref><!--  and to be the birthplace of "Heavenly Tradition", ushering in God's kingdom. -->

== 回教 ==
許多[[回教徒|回教徒]]相信[[回教|回教]]是專屬於他們的宗教，他們是阿拉的選民。而另一部分回教徒，相信[[阿拉|阿拉]]會救每一个好人，包括其它的[[有經者|有經者]]，這是因為回教徒相信，[[阿拉|阿拉]]、[[基督徒|基督徒]]的[[耶和華|耶和華]]和[[猶太人|猶太人]]的[[雅威|雅威]]，是同一位神，詳見《[[可兰经|可兰经]]》。<!-- <blockquote>Say, 'People of the Book! come to a proposition which is the same for us and you - that we should worship none but God and not associate any partners with Him and not take one another as lords besides God.' If they turn away, say, 'Bear witness that we are Muslims.'(Surah Al 'Imran; 3:64)
<br><br>
Today all good things have been allowed to you. And the food of those given the Book is also allowed to you and your food is allowed to them. So are chaste women from among the muminun and chaste women of those given the Book before you, once you have given them their dowries in marriage, not in fornication or taking them as lovers. But as for anyone who rejects faith, his actions will come to nothing and in the akhira he will be among the losers. (Surat al-Ma'ida: 5:5)
<br><br>
Among the people of the Book there are some who have faith in God and in what has been sent down to you and what was sent down to them, and who are humble before God. They do not sell God's Signs for a paltry price. Such people will have their reward with their Lord. And God is swift at reckoning. (Surah Al 'Imran; 3:199)
<br><br>
Call to the way of your Lord with wisdom and fair admonition, and argue with them in the kindest way. Your Lord knows best who is misguided from His way. And He knows best who are guided. (Surat an-Nahl; 16:125)
<br><br>
...You will find the people most affectionate to those who have faith are those who say, 'We are Christians.' That is because some of them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant. (Surat al-Ma'ida; 5:82)
<br><br>
Only argue with the People of the Book in the kindest way - except in the case of those of them who do wrong - saying, 'We have faith in what has been sent down to us and what was sent down to you. Our God and your God are one and we submit to Him.'(Surat al-'Ankabut; 29:46)
<br><br>
...There is a community among the People of the Book who are upright. They recite God's Signs throughout the night, and they prostrate. They have iman in God and the Last Day, and enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and compete in doing good. They are among the salihun. You will not be denied the reward for any good thing you do. God knows those who have taqwa. (Surah Al 'Imran: 3:113-115)
<br><br>
Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in Allâh and the Last Day and does righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor they grieve. (Surat al-Baqara; 2:62)</blockquote>

Muslims who believe Islam is in an adversarial relationship with Christianity and Judaism, cite other verses such as:

<blockquote>O you who believe! Do not take the Jews and the Christians for friends; they are friends of each other; and whoever amongst you takes them for a friend, then surely he is one of them; surely God does not guide the unjust people. (Qur'an 5:51)
<br><br>
You People of the Book! Why do you clothe Truth with falsehood and conceal the Truth while you have knowledge? Surah 3.71 
<br><br>
Can you, o you men of Faith, entertain the hope that they will believe in you? Seeing that a party of them heard the Word of God and perverted it knowingly after they understood it. Surah 2.75
</blockquote>

Islamic supersessionism presents Muslims as the only people chosen to carry the true word of God.. In the [[Qur'an|Qur'an]], according to the supersessionists, The Jewish people of that particular time period are charged with "falsehood" (Sura 3:71), distortion (4:46), and of being "corrupters of Scripture."  

Some parts of the Qur'an attribute differences between Muslims and non-Muslims to ''tahri fi-manawi'', a "corruption of the meaning" of the words. In this view, the Jewish Bible and Christian New Testament are true, but the Jews and Christians misunderstood the meaning of their own Scriptures, and thus need the Qur'an to clearly understand the will of God. Other parts of the Qur'an teach that many Jews and Christians deliberately altered their scripture, and thus altered the word of God in order to deceive their co-religionists.  This belief was developed further in medieval Islamic polemics, and is a mainstream belief in much of Islam today. This is known as the doctrine of ''tahrifi-lafzi'', "the corruption of the text." -->

== 印度教 ==
[[印度教|印度教]]并不强调「选民」的概念。大体上，印度教相信通过实践真理和精神修炼来达到解脱，神是公正的。但是在國內用[[種姓|種姓]]制刻意維護統治者的利益。<!--  [[Swami_Vivekananda|Swami Vivekananda]], a Hindu monk who advocated the harmony of all religions, taught that although the concept of "chosen people" is not ultimately true, it is a stage of growth and evolution that many religions must go through before they reach the higher truth of oneness. Vivekananda explained: 
<blockquote>[Such religions] naturally believe in a Personal God who is purely anthropomorphic, who like a great potentate in this world is pleased with some and displeased with others.  He is arbitrarily pleased with some people or races and showers blessings upon them.  You will find that in almost every religion is the idea: "We are the favorites of God, and only by believing as we do, can you be taken into favor with Him." And, therefore, in the nature of things, [such] religions are bound to fight and quarrel with each other.<ref>''Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda  Vol. II.141 (18th Reprint 1995) ISBN 81-85301-75-1''</ref></blockquote>

However, there are a few features of [[Hinduism|Hinduism]] that are reminiscent of a "chosen people" concept. The caste system of India confers a degree of birth-right on higher castes such as the [[Brahmins|Brahmins]], which some claim is sanctioned by God or by the scriptures.{{fact|date=April 2007}}  However, there is controversy within [[Hinduism|Hinduism]] about whether the caste system is really part of the Hindu religion, or is merely an outdated ''social'' institution.{{fact|date=April 2007}}

After the interactions with the West Asian religions, at present there exist a few [[cult|cult]]s or [[New_Religious_Movement|New Religious Movement]]s that consider themselves to be the Chosen people, e.g., the [[Brahma_Kumari_World_Spiritual_Organisation|Brahma Kumari World Spiritual Organisation]] [B.K.].  The B.K.s believe in a strict hierarchy of human souls in which they occupy the top 8, 108, 16,108 and 900,000 positions, which comprise the trunk of the human world tree.  All other religions are seen as branches of the tree, but a necessary part of the tree's beauty. --><!-- ==Rastafari==
[[Rastafari|Rastafari]] beliefs contain six fundamental principles, including the complete chosenness of the black race in the eyes of [[Jah|Jah]] (God incarnate), rendering them supreme physically and spiritually to all other people. Many Rastas are also physical immortalists who believe the chosen few will continue to live forever in their current bodies. This idea of ever living (rather than everlasting) life is very strong and important.

Given Jewish biblical tradition and Ethiopian legend via [[Kebra_Nagast|Kebra Nagast]], Rastas believe that Israel's [[King_Solomon|King Solomon]], together with Ethiopian [[Queen_of_Sheba|Queen of Sheba]], conceived a child which began the [[Solomonic_line|Solomonic line]] of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the African people as the true children of Israel, and thereby chosen. Reinforcement of this belief occurred when [[Beta_Israel|Beta Israel]], Ethiopia's ancient Jewish community, were rescued from Sudanese famine and brought to Israel during [[Operation_Moses|Operation Moses]] in 1985. -->
