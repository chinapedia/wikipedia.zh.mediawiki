<!--==劇情==
===Background===
In the context of the series, [[Marceline_the_Vampire_Queen|Marceline the Vampire Queen]] is a thousand year-old vampire.<ref name="evicted">{{cite episode| title=Evicted! | series=Adventure Time| serieslink=Adventure Time |credits = Larry Leichliter (director); Bert Youn & Sean Jimenez (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=May 17, 2010 | season = 1 | number = 12}}</ref><ref name=cotw>{{cite web|title=Character of the Week: Marceline {{!}} Character Facts of the Week: Marceline from Adventure Time|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.co.uk/blogs/character-facts-of-the-week-marceline-from-adventure-time|publisher=[[Cartoon_Network|CartoonNetwork.co.uk]]|accessdate=October 26, 2012|date=January 24, 2012}}</ref> The [[Ice_King|Ice King]] is a recurring antagonist of the series, and frequently steals princesses throughout Ooo; although he is often at odds with Finn and Jake, he is generally not a serious threat. He was formerly a human archaeologist named Simon Petrikov who discovered a magic crown that gives him magical ice powers but eroded his memory and made him go insane.<ref name=characters>{{cite web|title=Adventure Time {{!}} Characters|url=http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/adventuretime/characters/index.html|publisher=[[Cartoon_Network|CartoonNetwork.com]]|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}</ref> In addition, throughout the series, various character and events hint at the mysterious Mushroom War, a cataclysmic war that destroyed modern human society.<ref name=avclub/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wizards.com/dnd/Article.aspx?x=dnd/4spot/20110408|title=Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Official Home Page – Pendleton Ward Interview|publisher=Wizards of the Coast LLC|date=April 8, 2011|accessdate=August 23, 2011}}</ref>

===Events===
The Ice King decides that he wants to enlist Marceline's help in writing a song to woo princesses, taking pages randomly torn from an old scrapbook with him for later inspiration. He flies to her cave, and after a minor scuffle that involves [[Finn_the_Human|Finn]] and [[Jake_the_Dog|Jake]], Marceline finally relents and helps him write a song. At first, the Ice King simply sings a song he wrote about Princess Bubblegum, before breaking down, crying about his loneliness and damaging Mareceline's living room with his ice magic. Marceline tells him to stop acting crazy, and he pushes her, before timidly retreating to the top of her refrigerator. Marceline begins to lament, via the song "Nuts," and notes that, despite his instability, she is glad to see him. The Ice King is surprised to find out that she "likes" him and asks for a hug. However, when he misinterprets her feelings and tries to kiss her, Marceline angrily confronts him and asks if he remembers his past by calling him by his actual name: Simon.

The Ice King is oblivious to his former self, and Marceline begins looking through the Ice King's scrapbook pages to show him evidence of his former life. Among the pages is a picture of a young Marceline, with a message to her from a thousand years ago scrawled on the back. The message, written by Simon before his mind was completely consumed by the magic of the crown, asks Marceline to forgive him for whatever he does under the crown's influence. The Ice King fails to understand the context, and believes that he has written not a note of apology but lyrics, and attempts to add music to his "song". Overcome by emotion, Marceline cries and begins singing along while the Ice King plays drums, oblivious as to what is actually going on.

While the eponymous song "Remember You" is being sung, the episode flashes back almost a thousand years before the events of the episode. A young Marceline is seen crying in the wreckage of a city, presumably after the cataclysmic Mushroom War. Simon Petrikov sees her from a distance and runs over. In an attempt to comfort her, he gives her Hambo, a teddy bear, that he finds in the ruins of a toy store. Marceline takes the stuffed animal, stops crying, and looks up in happiness.

"I Remember You" was storyboarded by Cole Sanchez and [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]], from a story by Patrick McHale, [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], and [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]]. The episode was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref>{{cite episode| title=I Remember You| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Larry Leichliter (director); Rebecca Sugar & Cole Sanchez (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=October 15, 2012 | season = 4 | number = 25}}</ref> The idea to create an episode based on a shared history between Marceline and the Ice King was Ward's idea. Sugar had also been pushing for a Marceline and Ice King musical episode.<ref name=music>Ward, Pendleton, et al. 2014. "Distant Bands: The Music of Adventure Time" [Featurette], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> Sugar was responsible for designing Marceline's look in the episode. According to her, the shirt that Marceline wears was "loosely based off a stretched out old [[Drug_Abuse_Resistance_Education|D.A.R.E.]] shirt."<ref>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rebecca|title=Concept Drawing|url=http://rebeccasugar.tumblr.com/post/33695866290/concept-drawing-of-marcelines-saturday-outfit|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=April 16, 2013|date=October 16, 2012}}</ref> The original working title for the episode was "Help". Former storyboard artist and creative director for the series Adam Muto joked that the change was made due to the famous [[The_Beatles|Beatles]] [[Help!_(song)|song of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Muto|first=Adam|title=Why Is Help Episode is I Remember You By Formspringers?|url=http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/378718558126887168|publisher=[[Formspring|Formspring]]|accessdate=April 16, 2013|date=October 5, 2012}}</ref>

The episode features four songs: "Fry Song", "Oh Bubblegum", "Nuts", and the titular "Remember You".<ref name=bubblenuts>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rebecca|title='Oh Bubblegum' and 'Nuts' Demos!|url=http://rebeccasugar.tumblr.com/post/33696701650/oh-bubblegum-and-nuts-demos-plus-the-chords|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=April 16, 2013|date=October 16, 2012}}</ref><ref name=rememberyousong>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rebecca|title='Remember You' Demo and Chords!|url=http://rebeccasugar.tumblr.com/post/33762090124/remember-you-demo-and-chords-c-f-fm|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=April 16, 2013|date=October 17, 2012}}</ref> Sugar composed the music for all four, and wrote the lyrics, although Sanchez co-wrote the lyrics for "Oh Bubblegum".<ref name=bubblenuts/> For the eponymous song, Sugar noted that it "was so amazing to work with Olivia Olson and Tom Kenny on the songs for this episode, they had so much chemistry in the booth together!"<ref name=allnew/> She wrote that she constructed the episode to "do them justice."<ref name=allnew>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rebecca|title=All New Adventure Time, I Remember You!|url=http://rebeccasugar.tumblr.com/post/33472838132/all-new-adventure-time-i-remember-you-monday-at|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=April 16, 2013|date=October 12, 2012}}</ref> Olson noted that, despite the sad themes featured in the installment, recording the dialogue with Kenny and music for the episode was a fun experience. While the two were recording, Olson had to sing Kenny his melodies; Kenny would then parrot the lines back in the voice of the Ice King.<ref name=soundcloudoliviamartin>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Zack|title=Adventure Time Ancient Psychic Tandem Warcast Episode 5|url=https://soundcloud.com/zack-smith-81/martin-and-olivia-final|publisher=[[Soundcloud|Soundcloud]]|accessdate=May 3, 2014|date=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

Sugar recorded demos of the three new songs, although the "Fry Song" had originally appeared in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_2)|second season]] episode "It Came from the Nightosphere". During the recording of the aforementioned episode, Tom Kenny recorded his own version of the "Fry Song" for fun. This version later inspired Ice King's version in "I Remember You".<ref name=penremember>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014.

In addition, the [[omnichord|omnichord]] that Sugar used in the demo of "Remember You" actually made it into the episode.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rob|title=Remember You—Rebecca Sugar Adventure Time Demo|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzmlnbnenSI|publisher=[[YouTube|YouTube]]|accessdate=April 16, 2013|date=October 14, 2012}}</ref> According to Rob, the "off-key notes were accidents of running out of power—it took a lot of tries to make it happen on cue."<ref>{{cite web|last=Sugar|first=Rob|title=Oh Bubblegum/Nuts—Demo from Adventure Time|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLmafb00Kyw|publisher=[[YouTube|YouTube]]|accessdate=April 17, 2013|date=October 15, 2012}}</ref> While Sugar was pitching the song, she played her songs but her omnichord started to lose power.

The episode received glowing critical reception. [[Charlie_Jane_Anders|Charlie Jane Anders]] of [[io9|io9]] called the episode "one of the most intense things I've seen in ages."<ref name=io9/> She specifically cited the final flashback as noteworthy, noting that "The final scene, where Marceline and Ice King have this weird duet, made me lose my shit and keeps popping into my head. It's rare that any television show gets its hooks into your brain like that, but especially a kid's cartoon."<ref name=io9/> She concluded that the main reason that the ending was so powerful was that it showed the viewers the "immediate aftermath of the Mushroom War" and allowed the viewers to see "the way Marceline's personal loss mirrors the wider loss of the end of the entire world" following the war.<ref name=io9>{{cite web|last=Anders|first=Charlie|title=How Did Adventure Time Become Better Than Most Live-Action TV Shows?|url=http://io9.com/5952962/how-did-adventure-time-become-better-than-most-live+action-tv-shows|work=[[io9|io9]]|publisher=[[Gawker_Media|Gawker Media]]|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref>
