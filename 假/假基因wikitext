'''假基因'''（Pseudogenes，Pseudo-意爲「假」）是一類染色體上的[[基因|基因]]片段。假基因的序列通常與對應的[[基因|基因]]相似，但至少是喪失了一部分功能，如基因不能[[基因表达|表達]]或[[遗传密码|編碼]]的[[蛋白質|蛋白質]]沒有功能<ref name="Biomed10.1186">{{cite journal |vauthors= Vanin EF |title= Processed pseudogenes: characteristics and evolution |url= https://archive.org/details/sim_annual-review-of-genetics_1985_19/page/253 |journal= Annual Review of Genetics |volume= 19 |pages= 253–72 |year= 1985 |pmid= 3909943 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.ge.19.120185.001345}}</ref>。

一般認爲，假基因最初是功能對生物生存並非必要的基因。隨着[[基因突變|突變]]的積累，出現編碼區提前出現[[終止密碼子|終止密碼子]]、{{Link-en|移碼突變|Translational frameshift}}等情況，逐漸變爲無功能的假基因。另外，{{link-en|拷貝數變異|Copy-number variation}}（Copy-number variation, CNV）也可能產生假基因。在拷貝數變異中，1kb（千[[鹼基對|鹼基對]]）以上的DNA片段會發生複製或刪除<ref name="">{{cite journal |vauthors= Chang Y, Stuart A, et al. |title= Antigen presenting genes and genomic copy number variations in the Tasmanian devil MHC |journal= BMC Genomics |volume= 13:87 |year= 2012 |doi= 10.1186/1471-2164-13-87}}</ref>。一部分假基因既沒有[[內含子|內含子]]，也沒有[[啓動子|啓動子]]（這種啓動子被認爲是通過mRNA的逆轉錄轉移到染色體上的，稱爲「加工」假基因（processed pseudogenes））<ref>{{cite book |last1= Herron |first1= Jon C.|last2= Freeman |first2= Scott |name-list-format= vanc |title= Evolutionary analysis |url= https://archive.org/details/evolutionaryanal0000free_i9s5 |publisher= Pearson Prentice Hall |location= Upper Saddle River, NJ |year= 2007 |edition= 4th |isbn= 978-0-13-227584-2}}</ref>，但部分假基因仍然擁有一些與正常基因相同的特徵，比如擁有[[CpG島|CpG島]]等啓動子、[[RNA剪接|RNA剪接]]位點等。

假基因這一名詞是由雅克（Jacq）等人於1977年最早提出的<ref name="pmid561661">{{cite journal |vauthors= Jacq C, Miller JR, Brownlee GG |title= A pseudogene structure in 5S DNA of Xenopus laevis |journal= Cell |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |pages= 109–20 |date= September 1977 |pmid= 561661 |doi= 10.1016/0092-8674(77)90189-1}}</ref>。長期以來生物學家們認爲假基因是沒有功能的[[垃圾DNA|垃圾DNA]]，惟近年來的研究還表明假基因和其他非編碼片段一樣，擁有調控基因表達的功能。假基因的調控作用對維持生物體的生理活動有着重要意義，一部分假基因在某些疾病的發展中也扮演着重要角色<ref name="pmid25391452">{{cite journal |vauthors= Xiao-Jie L, Ai-Mei G, Li-Juan J, Jiang X |title= Pseudogene in cancer: real functions and promising signature |journal= Journal of Medical Genetics |volume= 52 |issue= 1 |pages= 17–24 |date= January 2015 |pmid= 25391452 |doi= 10.1136/jmedgenet-2014-102785}}</ref>。

在進化生物學研究中，這些因為演化而喪失功能的假基因，對他們進行序列分析意義則相對重大，一直是研究者獲知生物進化歷程的手段。假基因一般會擁有一些源基因的特徵。按照[[進化論|進化論]]的觀點，兩個親緣關係較近的物種擁有同一祖先。對假基因進行序列比對、分析，即可驗證兩物種是否擁有同一祖先，並能計算出兩物種開始分離的時間（結果能精確到百萬年）。

==特性==
{{TransH}}
假基因通常以与已知基因的同源性和某些功能丧失的组合为特征。 也就是说，尽管每个假基因都具有与某些功能基因相似的DNA序列，但它们通常无法产生功能性的最终蛋白质产物。由于同源性和功能丧失的两个要求，假基因有时难以在基因组中鉴定和表征。 通常是通过序列比对而不是生物学上证实的。
#Homology is implied by sequence identity between the DNA sequences of the pseudogene and parent gene. After [[sequence_alignment|aligning]] the two sequences, the percentage of identical [[base_pair|base pair]]s is computed. A high sequence identity means that it is highly likely that these two sequences diverged from a common ancestral sequence (are homologous), and highly unlikely that these two sequences have evolved independently (see [[Convergent_evolution|Convergent evolution]]).
#Nonfunctionality can manifest itself in many ways. Normally, a gene must go through several steps to a fully functional protein: [[Transcription_(genetics)|Transcription]], [[pre-mRNA_processing|pre-mRNA processing]], [[translation_(biology)|translation]], and [[protein_folding|protein folding]] are all required parts of this process. If any of these steps fails, then the sequence may be considered nonfunctional. In high-throughput pseudogene identification, the most commonly identified disablements are premature [[stop_codon|stop codon]]s and [[frameshift_mutation|frameshifts]], which almost universally prevent the translation of a functional protein product.

Pseudogenes for [[RNA|RNA]] genes are usually more difficult to discover as they do not need to be translated and thus do not have "reading frames".

Pseudogenes can complicate molecular genetic studies. For example, amplification of a gene by [[polymerase_chain_reaction|PCR]] may simultaneously amplify a pseudogene that shares similar sequences. This is known as PCR bias or amplification bias. Similarly, pseudogenes are sometimes annotated as genes in [[genome|genome]] sequences.

Processed pseudogenes often pose a problem for [[gene_prediction|gene prediction]] programs, often being misidentified as real genes or exons. It has been proposed that identification of processed pseudogenes can help improve the accuracy of gene prediction methods.<ref name="Van_Baren_Brent_2006">{{cite journal |vauthors= van Baren MJ, Brent MR |title= Iterative gene prediction and pseudogene removal improves genome annotation |journal= Genome Research |volume= 16 |issue= 5 |pages= 678–85 |date= May 2006 |pmid= 16651666 |pmc= 1457044 |doi= 10.1101/gr.4766206}}</ref>

Recently 140 human pseudogenes have been shown to be translated.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kim|first1=MS et al|title=A draft map of the human proteome.|journal=Nature|date=2014|volume=509|pages=575–581|doi=10.1038/nature13302|pmid=24870542|pmc=4403737}}</ref> However, the function, if any, of the protein products is unknown.

==类型及成因==
根据不同的起源机制和特点，假基因可大致分为如下四类：
經處理的假基因 (Processed)、未經處理的假基因 (Non-processed)、單套假基因 (Unitary pseudogenes)、假的假基因 (Pseudo-pseudogenes)。

===Processed===
[[File:Pseudogene2jpg.jpg|thumb]]
Processed (or [[transposable_element|retrotransposed]]) pseudogenes. In higher [[eukaryote|eukaryote]]s, particularly [[mammal|mammal]]s, retrotransposition is a fairly common event that has had a huge impact on the composition of the genome. For example, somewhere between 30–44% of the [[human_genome|human genome]] consists of repetitive elements such as [[Retrotransposon#SINEs|SINEs]] and [[Retrotransposon#LINEs|LINEs]] (see [[retrotransposons|retrotransposons]]).<ref name="Jurka_2004">{{cite journal |vauthors= Jurka J |title= Evolutionary impact of human Alu repetitive elements |journal= Current Opinion in Genetics & Development |volume= 14 |issue= 6 |pages= 603–8 |date= December 2004 |pmid= 15531153 |doi= 10.1016/j.gde.2004.08.008}}</ref><ref name="Dewannieux_2005">{{cite journal |vauthors= Dewannieux M, Heidmann T |title= LINEs, SINEs and processed pseudogenes: parasitic strategies for genome modeling |journal= Cytogenetic and Genome Research |volume= 110 |issue= 1–4 |pages= 35–48 |year= 2005 |pmid= 16093656 |doi= 10.1159/000084936}}</ref> In the process of retrotransposition, a portion of the [[messenger_RNA|mRNA]] or [[hnRNA|hnRNA]] transcript of a gene is spontaneously [[reverse_transcription|reverse transcribed]] back into DNA and inserted into chromosomal DNA.

===Non-processed===
[[File:Pseudogene3jpg.jpg|thumb]]
Non-processed (or duplicated) pseudogenes. [[Gene_duplication|Gene duplication]] is another common and important process in the evolution of genomes. A copy of a functional gene may arise as a result of a gene duplication event caused by [[homologous_recombination|homologous recombination]] at, for example, repetitive [[short_interspersed_element|sine]] sequences on misaligned chromosomes and subsequently acquire [[mutation|mutation]]s that cause the copy to lose the original gene's function. Duplicated pseudogenes usually have all the same characteristics as genes, including an intact [[exon|exon]]-[[intron|intron]] structure and regulatory sequences. The loss of a duplicated gene's functionality usually has little effect on an organism's [[fitness_(biology)|fitness]], since an intact functional copy still exists. According to some evolutionary models, shared duplicated pseudogenes indicate the evolutionary relatedness of humans and the other primates.<ref name="Max">{{cite web |url= http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/molgen/ |title= Plagiarized Errors and Molecular Genetics |author= Max EE |date= 2003-05-05 |publisher= [[TalkOrigins_Archive|TalkOrigins Archive]] |accessdate= 2008-07-22 |archive-date= 2020-11-12 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20201112020300/http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/molgen/ |dead-url= no }}</ref> If pseudogenization is due to gene duplication, it usually occurs in the first few million years after the gene duplication, provided the gene has not been subjected to any [[selection_pressure|selection pressure]].<ref name="Lynch_Conery_2000">{{cite journal |vauthors= Lynch M, Conery JS |title= The evolutionary fate and consequences of duplicate genes |journal= Science |volume= 290 |issue= 5494 |pages= 1151–5 |date= November 2000 |pmid= 11073452 |doi= 10.1126/science.290.5494.1151|bibcode= 2000Sci...290.1151L}}</ref> Gene duplication generates functional [[gene_redundancy|redundancy]] and it is not normally advantageous to carry two identical genes.

===Unitary pseudogenes===
[[File:Pseudogene4jpg.jpg|thumb]]
Various mutations (such as [[indel|indel]]s and [[nonsense_mutation|nonsense mutation]]s) can prevent a gene from being normally [[transcription_(biology)|transcribed]] or [[Translation_(biology)|translated]], and thus the gene may become less- or non-functional or "deactivated". These are the same mechanisms by which non-processed genes become pseudogenes, but the difference in this case is that the gene was not duplicated before pseudogenization. Normally, such a pseudogene would be unlikely to become fixed in a population, but various population effects, such as [[genetic_drift|genetic drift]], a [[population_bottleneck|population bottleneck]], or, in some cases, [[natural_selection|natural selection]], can lead to fixation. The classic example of a unitary pseudogene is the gene that presumably coded the enzyme [[L-gulonolactone_oxidase|L-gulono-γ-lactone oxidase]] (GULO) in primates. In all mammals studied besides primates (except guinea pigs), GULO aids in the biosynthesis of [[ascorbic_acid|ascorbic acid]] (vitamin C), but it exists as a disabled gene (GULOP) in humans and other primates.<ref name="Nishikimi _1992">{{cite journal|vauthors= Nishikimi M, Kawai T, Yagi K |title= Guinea pigs possess a highly mutated gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the key enzyme for L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis missing in this species |journal= The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume= 267 |issue= 30|pages= 21967–72 |date= October 1992 |pmid= 1400507}}</ref><ref name="Nishikimi _1994">{{cite journal |vauthors= Nishikimi M, Fukuyama R, Minoshima S, Shimizu N, Yagi K |title= Cloning and chromosomal mapping of the human nonfunctional gene for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, the enzyme for L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis missing in man |journal= The Journal of Biological Chemistry |volume= 269 |issue= 18 |pages= 13685–8 |date= May 1994 |pmid= 8175804}}</ref> Another more recent example of a disabled gene links the deactivation of the [[caspase_12|caspase 12]] gene (through a [[nonsense_mutation|nonsense mutation]]) to positive selection in humans.<ref name="Xue_2006">{{cite journal |vauthors= Xue Y, Daly A, Yngvadottir B, Liu M, Coop G, Kim Y, Sabeti P, Chen Y, Stalker J, Huckle E, Burton J, Leonard S, Rogers J, Tyler-Smith C |title= Spread of an inactive form of caspase-12 in humans is due to recent positive selection |url= https://archive.org/details/sim_american-journal-of-human-genetics_2006-04_78_4/page/659 |journal= American Journal of Human Genetics |volume= 78 |issue= 4 |pages= 659–70 |date= April 2006 |pmid= 16532395 |pmc= 1424700 |doi= 10.1086/503116}}</ref>

===Pseudo-pseudogenes===

The rapid proliferation of [[DNA_sequencing|DNA sequencing]] technologies has led to the identification of many apparent pseudogenes using [[gene_prediction|gene prediction]] techniques. Pseudogenes are often identified by the appearance of a premature [[stop_codon|stop codon]] in a predicted mRNA sequence, which would, in theory, prevent synthesis ([[translation_(biology)|translation]]) of the normal [[protein|protein]] product of the original gene. There have been some reports of translational readthrough of such premature stop codons in mammals, as reviewed in the "[[stop_codon#Translational_readthrough|Translational readthrough]]" section of the stop codon article. As alluded to in the figure above, a small amount of the protein product of such readthrough may still be recognizable and function at some level. If so, the pseudogene can be subject to [[natural_selection|natural selection]]. That appears to have happened during the evolution of ''[[Drosophila|Drosophila]]'' [[species|species]], as described next.
[[File:Drosophila_melanogaster_-_side_(aka).jpg|thumb]]
In 2016 it was reported that 4 predicted pseudogenes in multiple ''Drosophila'' species actually encode proteins with biologically important functions,<ref name= "Prieto-Godino_2016">{{cite journal |vauthors= Prieto-Godino LL, Rytz R, Bargeton B, Abuin L, Arguello JR, Peraro MD, Benton R |title= Olfactory receptor pseudo-pseudogenes |journal= Nature |volume= 539 |issue= 7627 |pages= 93–97 |date= November 2016 |pmid= 27776356 |doi= 10.1038/nature19824 |pmc=5164928}}</ref> "suggesting that such 'pseudo-pseudogenes' could represent a widespread phenomenon".

#There are many reports of pseudogene transcripts acting as [[microRNA|microRNA]] decoys. Perhaps the earliest definitive example of such a pseudogene involved in cancer is the pseudogene of [[BRAF_(gene)|BRAF]]. The BRAF gene is a [[proto-oncogene|proto-oncogene]] that, when mutated, is associated with many cancers. Normally, the amount of BRAF protein is kept under control in cells through the action of miRNA. In normal situations, the amount of RNA from BRAF and the pseudogene BRAFP1 compete for miRNA, but the balance of the 2 RNAs is such that cells grow normally. However, when BRAFP1 RNA expression is increased (either experimentally or by natural mutations), less miRNA is available to control the expression of BRAF, and the increased amount of BRAF protein causes cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Karreth FA, Reschke M, Ruocco A, Ng C, Chapuy B, Léopold V, Sjoberg M, Keane TM, Verma A, Ala U, Tay Y, Wu D, Seitzer N, Velasco-Herrera Mdel C, Bothmer A, Fung J, Langellotto F, Rodig SJ, Elemento O, Shipp MA, Adams DJ, Chiarle R, Pandolfi PP |title= The BRAF pseudogene functions as a competitive endogenous RNA and induces lymphoma in vivo |journal= Cell |volume= 161 |issue= 2 |pages= 319–32 |date= April 2015 |pmid= 25843629 |doi= 10.1016/j.cell.2015.02.043}}</ref> This sort of '''c'''ompetition for regulatory elements by RNAs that are '''e'''ndogenous to the genome has given rise to the term [[ceRNA|'''ce'''RNA]].
#The [[PTEN_(gene)|PTEN]] gene is a known [[tumor_suppressor_gene|tumor suppressor gene]]. The PTEN pseudogene, PTENP1 is a processed pseudogene that is very similar in its genetic sequence to the wild-type gene. However, PTENP1 has a missense mutation which eliminates the [[codon|codon]] for the [[eukaryotic_translation|initiating methionine]] and thus prevents translation of the normal PTEN protein.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Dahia PL, FitzGerald MG, Zhang X, Marsh DJ, Zheng Z, Pietsch T, von Deimling A, Haluska FG, Haber DA, Eng C |title= A highly conserved processed PTEN pseudogene is located on chromosome band 9p21 |journal= Oncogene |volume= 16 |issue= 18 |pages= 2403–6 |date= May 1998 |pmid= 9620558 |doi= 10.1038/sj.onc.1201762}}</ref> In spite of that, PTENP1 appears to play a role in [[oncogenesis|oncogenesis]]. The 3' [[untranslated_region|UTR]] of PTENP1 mRNA functions as a decoy of PTEN mRNA by targeting [[micro_RNA|micro RNA]]s due to its similarity to the PTEN gene, and overexpression of the 3' UTR resulted in an increase of PTEN protein level.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Poliseno L, Salmena L, Zhang J, Carver B, Haveman WJ, Pandolfi PP |title= A coding-independent function of gene and pseudogene mRNAs regulates tumour biology |journal= Nature |volume= 465 |issue= 7301 |pages= 1033–8 |date= June 2010 |pmid= 20577206 |doi= 10.1038/nature09144|pmc=3206313}}</ref> That is, overexpression of the PTENP1 3' UTR leads to increased regulation and suppression of cancerous tumors. The biology of this system is basically the inverse of the BRAF system described above.
#Pseudogenes can, over evolutionary time scales, participate in [[gene_conversion|gene conversion]] and other mutational events that may give rise to new or newly-functional genes. This has led to the concept, used in a major review from 2003, that '''''pseudo'''''genes could be viewed as '''''pot'''''ogenes: '''''pot'''''ential genes for evolutionary diversification.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors= Balakirev ES, Ayala FJ |title= Pseudogenes: are they "junk" or functional DNA? |journal= Annual Review of Genetics |volume= 37 |pages= 123–51|date= 2003 |pmid= 14616058 |doi= 10.1146/annurev.genet.37.040103.103949}}</ref>
