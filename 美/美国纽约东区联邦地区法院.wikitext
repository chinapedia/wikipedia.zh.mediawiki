The main courthouse is at 225 [[Cadman_Plaza|Cadman Plaza]] East in the civic center of Brooklyn.  The 15-story building was designed by [[Cesar_Pelli|Cesar Pelli]]. The courthouse was designed in 1995 but did not open until 2006 following redesign requirements in the wake of the [[Oklahoma_City_bombing|Oklahoma City bombing]] and the [[September_11_attacks|September 11 attacks]].  It replaced the 6 story [[Emanuel_Celler|Emanuel Celler]] Federal Building (built in 1962 and located next door via glass atrium).  In 2008 it was renamed for [[Theodore_Roosevelt|Theodore Roosevelt]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/30/us-courthouse-is-named-for-theodore-roosevelt/ | work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Courthouse Is Named for Theodore Roosevelt | first=Jason | last=Grant | date=December 30, 2008}}</ref>  The building was originally to be renamed in honor of former New York Governor [[Hugh_Carey|Hugh Carey]] but politicians backed off because Carey was alive at the time.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/brooklyn/2008/12/30/2008-12-30_brooklyn_courthouse_gets_new_name_since_-2.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Brooklyn courthouse gets new name since namesake is still alive | first=John | last=Marzulli | date=December 31, 2008}}</ref> The associated prison is the [[Metropolitan_Detention_Center,_Brooklyn|Metropolitan Detention Center, Brooklyn]].

The Divisional office is in the [[Alfonse_M._D'Amato_United_States_Courthouse|Alfonse M. D'Amato United States Courthouse]] in [[Central_Islip,_New_York|Central Islip, New York]].  The courthouse designed by [[Richard_Meier|Richard Meier]] opened in 2000 and is the largest building on [[Long_Island|Long Island]].<ref>http://www.nyed.uscourts.gov/</ref> The 12-story building has {{convert|870000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}, 23 courtrooms and 24 judges' chambers.<ref>http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&id=134995</ref>
It is the third largest federal courthouse in the United States (after the [[Daniel_Patrick_Moynihan_United_States_Courthouse|Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse]] and [[Thomas_F._Eagleton_United_States_Courthouse|Thomas F.
