'''美国纽约南区联邦地区法院'''<ref>中文名见[http://www.chinanews.com/hr/hr-mzhrxw/news/2010/04-24/2245520.shtml]，[http://www.jus.cn/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=3222] {{Wayback|url=http://www.jus.cn/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=3222 |date=20150607141628 }}</ref>（United States District Court for the Southern District of New York，在法律引用中缩写为“S.D.N.Y.”）是美国的一个[[美国联邦地方法院|联邦地区法院]]。本法院判决的案件如需上诉，需上诉至[[美国联邦第二巡回上诉法院|联邦第二巡回上诉法院]]，专利及《[[塔克法案|塔克法案]]》相关的案件需上诉至[[联邦巡回区法院|联邦巡回区法院]]。纽约南区法院是美国最有影响力、案件处理量最大的法院之一，因为[[纽约市|纽约市]]（除[[布鲁克林|布鲁克林]]、[[皇后区|皇后区]]、[[斯塔滕岛|斯塔滕岛]]，后三地属于[[美国纽约东区联邦地区法院|东区]]）很多涉及联邦法的案件都要在此审理。<ref>[http://www.law360.com/articles/305887/southern-district-of-ny-names-new-bankruptcy-court-chief Southern District Of NY Names New Bankruptcy Court Chief]</ref>现任首席法官为[[科琳·麥克馬洪|科琳·麥克馬洪]]。<ref>[http://www.nysd.uscourts.gov/ United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]</ref>

==司法管辖区==
以下地区位于纽约南区法院的司法管辖之下：[[曼哈顿|曼哈顿]]，[[布朗克斯|布朗克斯]]，[[威斯特徹斯特郡|威斯特切斯特郡]]，[[帕特南县_(纽约州)|帕特南县]]，[[罗克兰县_(纽约州)|罗克兰县]]，[[奥兰治县_(纽约州)|奥兰治县]]，[[达奇斯县_(纽约州)|达奇斯县]]，[[沙利文县_(纽约州)|沙利文县]]。{{link-en|美国纽约南区联邦检察院|U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York}}在纽约南区法院中代表联邦政府充当原告或被告。纽约南区有三座法院，两座在[[曼哈顿|曼哈顿]]，一座在[[白原市|白原市]]。在[[奥兰治县_(纽约州)|奥兰治县]]的[[米德爾敦_(紐約州)|米德爾敦]]也有一位基层法官在此审理案件。

==历史==
本院为根据《1789司法法》（1 Stat. 73）于1789年9月24日最先建立的13个法院之一，当时其管辖权覆盖整个纽约州。<ref name=S386>Asbury Dickens, ''A Synoptical Index to the Laws and Treaties of the United States of America'' (1852), p. 386.</ref><ref name=fjcny>[http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_district_ny.html U.S. District Courts of New York, Legislative history], ''[[Federal_Judicial_Center|Federal Judicial Center]]''.</ref>  
1814年4月9日通过的法律（3 Stat. 120）将纽约区再拆分为南北两区。<ref name=S386/><ref name=fjcny/>
南区后来又被1865年2月25日通过的 13 Stat. 438 分割出[[美国纽约东区联邦地区法院|东区]]，再于1900年5月12日通过的 31 Stat. 175 分割出西区。<ref name=fjcny/>

在南区存在的几百年时间里，其最早处理的大多是海事诉讼，之后又出现了大量破产诉讼。而破产诉讼案的激增，使得南区专门成立了破产法庭来处理此类案件。

从创建肇始，南区法官员额就有142个，比其他任何区法院都多。当中有12位法官得到提名，升任为[[联邦第二巡回上诉法院|第二巡回]]法庭的法官。<ref>
Since its creation, the Southern District of New York has had 142 judges, more than any other District. Twelve judges from the Southern District of New York have been elevated to the [[United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Second_Circuit|United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] - [[Augustus_Noble_Hand|Augustus Noble Hand]], [[Barrington_Daniels_Parker,_Jr.|Barrington Daniels Parker, Jr.]], [[Charles_Merrill_Hough|Charles Merrill Hough]], [[Irving_Kaufman|Irving Kaufman]], [[John_M._Walker,_Jr.|John M. Walker, Jr.]], [[Julius_Marshuetz_Mayer|Julius Marshuetz Mayer]], [[Learned_Hand|Learned Hand]], [[Pierre_N._Leval|Pierre N. Leval]], [[Sonia_Sotomayor|Sonia Sotomayor]], [[Wilfred_Feinberg|Wilfred Feinberg]], [[Gerard_E._Lynch|Gerard E. Lynch]], and [[陈卓光|陈卓光]]</ref>
这十二位供职第二巡回庭的原南区法官中有两位，[[Samuel_Blatchford|Samuel Blatchford]]和[[索尼娅·索托马约尔|索尼娅·索托马约尔]]，之后又从第二巡回庭晋升到[[美国最高法院|最高法院]]。
