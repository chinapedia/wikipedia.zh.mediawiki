[[File:United_States_Court_of_Federal_Claims.JPG|thumb]].]] Although the Federal Circuit typically hears all appeals from any of the United States district courts where the original action included a complaint arising under the patent laws, the [[United_States_Supreme_Court|Supreme Court]] has decided that it does not if the patent claims arose solely as [[counterclaim|counterclaim]]s by the defendant.<ref>[http://supreme.justia.com/us/535/826/case.html ''Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc.''], 2005. A bill to eliminate this situation, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.02955: H.R. 2955], was proposed on June 16, 2005 in the 109th Congress, but never passed.</ref> Though other appellate courts can now hear patent counter-claims in theory, this has not happened often.

The decisions of the Federal Circuit, particularly in regard to [[List_of_United_States_patent_law_cases|patent cases]], are unique in that they are [[binding_precedent|binding precedent]] throughout the U.S. within the bounds of the court's subject-matter jurisdiction. This is unlike the other courts of appeals as the authority of their decisions is restricted by geographic location and thus there may be differing judicial standards depending on location. Decisions of the Federal Circuit are only superseded by decisions of the Supreme Court or by applicable changes in the law. Also, review by the Supreme Court is discretionary, so Federal Circuit decisions are often the final word, especially since there are usually no [[circuit_split|circuit split]]s given the Federal Circuit's exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction. In its first decision, the Federal Circuit incorporated as binding precedent the decisions of its predecessor courts, the [[United_States_Court_of_Customs_and_Patent_Appeals|United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals]] and the appellate division of the [[United_States_Court_of_Claims|United States Court of Claims]].<ref>''South Corp. v. United States'', 690 F. 2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982)</ref>

Because the Court is one of national jurisdiction, panels from the court may sit anywhere in the country.  Typically, once or twice a year, the court will hold oral arguments in a city outside of its native Washington D.C.  The panels may sit in Federal courthouses, state courthouses, or even at law schools.

==Composition==
[[File:Fed_Cir_as_of_2012.jpg|thumb]]
The Federal Circuit may have a total of 12 active circuit judges sitting at any given time, who are required to reside within 50 miles of the District of Columbia, as set by {{usc|28|44}}. Judges on [[senior_status|senior status]] are not subject to this restriction. As with other [[federal_judges|federal judges]], they are nominated by the President and must be [[Advice_and_consent|confirmed]] by the Senate. Their terms last during the "good behavior" of the judges, which typically results in life tenure. When eligible, judges may elect to take [[senior_status|senior status]]. This allows a senior judge to continue to serve on the court while handling fewer cases than an active service judge. Each judge in active service employs a judicial assistant and up to four law clerks, while each judge in senior status employs a judicial assistant and one law clerk.<ref>[http://www.cafc.uscourts.gov/about.html About the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]</ref>

{{ChiefJudge}}

Notwithstanding the foregoing, when the court was initially created, Congress had to resolve which chief judge of the predecessor courts would become the first chief judge. It was decided that the chief judge of the predecessor court who had the most seniority, as chief judge, would be the new chief judge.<ref>{{USPL|97|164}} §166, {{USStat|96|50}}.</ref> This made Howard T. Markey, former chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the first chief judge.

===Succession of seats===
The court has twelve seats for active judges, numbered in alphabetical order by their occupant at the time the court was formed, with the sole vacant seat being numbered last. Judges who retire into [[senior_status|senior status]] remain on the bench but leave their seat vacant. That seat is filled by the next circuit judge appointed by the [[President_of_the_United_States|President]].
