'''雷尼·贝西亚'''（{{lang-en|Rainey Bethea}}，{{bd|1909年||1936年|8月14日}}）<ref>Bethea's birthdate has not been conclusively proven. He variously gave his birth year as 1909 to 1913. His Kentucky prison record states he was born October 16, 1909, but this might have been an approximation. The birthdate on his death certificate is blank. The 1910 United States Census for Bethea Township, Dillon County, South Carolina, lists a "Rainey Bethea," age 5, step son of Strans Bethea and son of Beulah Bethea. Similarly, a Rainey Bethea, Jr., age 11, son of Rainey Bethea, Sr., appears in the 1920 United States Census for Reaves Township, Marion County, South Carolina.</ref>是[[美国|美国]]最后一位被[[美国死刑制度|公开处决]]的死刑犯，其罪行是姦殺一名70岁妇女，1936年8月14日，貝西亞在[[肯塔基州|肯塔基州]][[欧文斯伯勒|欧文斯伯勒]]被公开吊死。
