在19世紀中期，一些[[新教徒|新教徒]]一改以往「容許適度喝酒」的觀點（適度說），認為「決定不喝酒，從現時的處景來說，是明至之舉」（棄權說），甚或是「禁止一切喝酒，並視之為罪惡」（禁令說）。<ref name="Gentry">{{cite book | author=[[Kenneth_Gentry|Kenneth Gentry]] | title=God Gave Wine | publisher=Oakdown |year=2001 | isbn=0-9700326-6-8 | pages=3ff}}</ref>時至今日，這三種說法仍同時存在，但傳統的說法依然最為普遍，當中[[英國國教|英國國教]]、[[羅馬天主教|羅馬天主教]]和[[東正教會|東正教會]]均支持這個觀點。

過半的[[福音派|福音派]]領袖（52%）都認為「滴酒不沾」與「好信徒」兩者不能混為一談，其中在印度/尼泊爾的領袖大都支持這個看法（83%），傳統的「基督教國家」則只佔42%。

Both the [[climate|climate]] and land of [[Palestine|Palestine]], where most of the Bible takes place, were well-suited to growing grapes,<ref name="Ewing">Ewing, p. 824.</ref> and the wine that the vineyards produced was a valued commodity in ancient times, both for local consumption and for its value in trade.<ref>See Broshi, ''passim'' (for instance, p. 29: Palestine was "a country known for its good wines").</ref><ref>Compare [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2Ch2:3,10 2Ch 2:3,10]</ref> Vineyards were protected from robbers and animals by walls, hedges, and manned [[watchtower|watchtower]]s.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ps80:8-15;Is5:1-2;Mk12:1;SS2:15 Ps 80:8-15; Is 5:1f; Mk 12:1; compare SS 2:15]</ref>

The fermentation process started within six to twelve hours after pressing, and the [[must|must]] was usually left in the collection vat for a few days to allow the initial, "tumultuous" stage of fermentation to pass. The wine makers soon transferred it either into large earthenware jars, which were then sealed, or, if the wine were to be transported elsewhere, into wineskins (that is, partially [[tanning|tanned]] [[domestic_goat|goat]]-skins, sewn up where the legs and tail had protruded but leaving the opening at the neck).<ref name="Ewing"/> After six weeks, fermentation was complete, and the wine was filtered into larger containers and either sold for consumption or stored in a [[basement|cellar]] or [[cistern|cistern]], lasting for three to four years.<ref name="Wine Making"/><ref name="Broshi26">Broshi, p. 26.</ref> Even after a year of aging, the vintage was still called "new wine," and more aged wines were preferred.<ref name="Broshi26"/><ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk5:39;Is25:6 Lk 5:39; compare Is 25:6]</ref><ref>Dommershausen, pp. 60-62.</ref>

Spices and scents were often added to wine in order to hide "defects" that arose from storage that was often not sufficient to prevent all spoiling.<ref>Broshi, p. 27.</ref> One might expect about 10% of any given cellar of wine to have been ruined completely, but [[vinegar|vinegar]] was also created intentionally for dipping bread<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ru2:14 Ru 2:14]</ref> among other uses.<ref>Broshi, p. 36.</ref>

The [[Sukkot|Feast of Booths]] was a prescribed holiday that immediately followed the harvest and pressing of the grapes.<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt16:13-15 Dt 16:13-15]</ref>

== Alcohol in Christian history and tradition ==
{{eucharist}}
For over 1,800 years, the regular use of wine in the celebration of the Eucharist and in daily life was the virtually universal and undisputed practice in Christianity.<ref name="ProtTrans1">{{cite journal|author=Keith Mathison | url=http://thirdmill.org/newfiles/kei_mathison/TH.Mathison.Prot.Transub.1.html| title=Protestant Transubstantiation - Part 1: Thesis; Biblical Witness | journal=IIIM Magazine Online | volume=2 | issue=49 |date=December 4–10, 2000 | accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> During the 19th and early 20th century, as a general sense of prohibitionism arose, many Christians, particularly some Protestants in the [[United_States|United States]], came to believe that the Bible prohibited alcohol or that the wisest choice in modern circumstances was for the Christian to abstain from alcohol willingly.

=== Before Christ ===
The Hebraic opinion of wine in the time before Christ was decidedly positive: wine is part of the world God created and is thus "necessarily inherently good,"<ref>Raymond, p. 48.</ref> though excessive use is soundly condemned. The Jews emphasized joy in the goodness of creation rather than the [[temperance_(virtue)|virtue of temperance]], which the [[Greek_philosophy|Greek philosophers]] advocated.<ref>Raymond, p. 49.</ref>

As the Jews returned from the Babylonian exile (starting in 537 BC) and the events of the Old Testament drew to a close, wine was "a common beverage for all classes and ages, including the very young; an important source of nourishment; a prominent part in the festivities of the people; a widely appreciated medicine; an essential provision for any fortress; and an important commodity," and it served as "a necessary element in the life of the Hebrews."<ref>{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=AWk8FGoJwWAC&printsec=frontcover | author=[[David_J._Hanson|David J.

Wine was, in antiquity, an important food and not just an embellishment to a feast ... Wine was essentially a man's drink in antiquity, when it became a significant dietary component. Even slaves were given a generous wine ration. Scholars estimate that in ancient Rome an adult consumed a liter of wine daily.

Although some abstentionists argue that wine in the Bible was almost always cut with water greatly decreasing its potency for inebriation,<ref name="MacArthurDrunk2"/> there is general agreement that, while Old Testament wine was sometimes mixed with various spices to enhance its flavor and stimulating properties, it was not usually diluted with water,<ref name="GentryUndiluted">Gentry, ''God Gave Wine'', pp. 143-146: "[R]ecognized biblical scholars of every stripe are in virtual agreement on the nondiluted nature of wine in the Old Testament."</ref><ref name="ISBEWine">{{cite encyclopedia| url=http://www.bible-history.com/isbe/W/WINE%3B+WINE+PRESS/ |encyclopedia=International Standard Bible Encyclopedia |title=Wine; Wine Press | author=Burton Scott Easton| editor=James Orr |year=1915 |accessdate=2007-03-09 |quote=In Old Testament times wine was drunk undiluted, and wine mixed with water was thought to be ruined (Isa 1:22) ...

This dilution is so normal in the following centuries that the Mishna can take it for granted and, indeed, R. Eliezer even forbade saying the table-blessing over undiluted wine (Berakhoth 7 5).

Abstentionists and prohibitionists are sometimes lumped together as "[[Teetotalism|teetotalers]]" (compare [[list_of_teetotalers|list of teetotalers]]) and share some similar arguments for their positions, but the distinction between them is that the latter abstain from alcohol as a matter of law (that is, they believe God requires abstinence in all ordinary circumstances), while the former abstain as a matter of prudence (that is, they believe total abstinence is the wisest and most loving way to live in the present circumstances).<ref name="Gentry"/>

Some groups of Christians fall entirely or virtually entirely into one of these categories, while others are divided between them. Fifty-two percent of [[Evangelicals|Evangelical]] leaders around the world say drinking alcohol is incompatible with being a good Evangelical. Even now nominally "Christian" countries still have 42% who say it is incompatible.<ref name="Global-Survey-Evangelical-Protestant-Leaders">{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2011/06/22/global-survey-of-evangelical-protestant-leaders/ |title=Global Survey of Evangelical Protestant Leaders |publisher=[[Pew_Forum|Pew Forum]] |year=2011 |accessdate=2013-10-31 |quote=[E]vangelical leaders are divided over the consumption of alcohol.

Roman Catholics in Kerala, India have also launched a major anti-drinking campaign, with a ban on drinking by church workers, alcohol consumption being a sin which must be confessed, also calling for prohibition of alcohol by the state.<ref name='KelaraCatholicBishopsCouncilTemperanceCommission'>{{cite web| url=http://www.kcbcsite.com/kcbc_commision_temperance.htm |title=Kerala Catholic Bishops' Council (KCBC) Temperance Commission |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>

Moderationism argues that, according to the biblical and traditional witness, (1) alcohol is a good gift of God that is rightly used in the Eucharist and for making the heart merry, and (2) while its dangers are real, it may be used wisely and moderately rather than being shunned or prohibited because of potential abuse.<ref name="ProtTrans1"/><ref name="ProtTrans4"/><ref name="Meyers1">{{cite journal|author=Jeffrey J.

On the first point, moderationists reflect the Hebrew mindset that all creation is good.<ref>Raymond, ''passim'', especially pp. 48f. He adds on p. 85, "St. Paul regards wine as intrinsically good, 'for every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it be received with thanksgiving' [ [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Ti+4:3-4 1Ti 4:3f] ]."</ref> The ancient [[Canons_of_the_Apostles|Canons of the Apostles]], which became part of [[Canon_Law|Canon Law]] in the eastern and western churches, likewise allows church leaders and laity to abstain from wine for [[mortification_of_the_flesh|mortification of the flesh]] but requires that they not "abominate" or detest it, which attitude "blasphemously abuses" the good creation.<ref>{{cite book| accessdate=2013-03-28 | editor-last=Schaff |editor-first=Philip | editor-link=Philip Schaff |title=Ante-Nicean Fathers |volume=VII |chapter=The Ecclesiastical Canons of the Same Holy Apostles |chapterurl=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf07.ix.ix.vi.html | quote=51. If any bishop, or presbyter, or deacon, or indeed any one of the sacerdotal catalogue, abstains from marriage, flesh, and wine, not for his own exercise, but because he abominates these things, forgetting that 'all things were very good,' and that 'God made man male and female,' and blasphemously abuses the creation, either let him reform, or let him be deprived [of his office], and be cast out of the Church; and the same for one of the laity.}}</ref> Going further, [[John_Calvin|John Calvin]] says that "it is lawful to use wine not only in cases of necessity, but also thereby to make us merry,"<ref>{{cite web|author=John Calvin | url=http://ccel.org/ccel/calvin/calcom11.xiii.iii.html#xiii.iii-p15.1 | work=Commentary on the Psalms | title=On Ps 104:15 | accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> and in his Genevan Catechism, he answers that wine is appropriate in the Lord's Supper because "by wine the hearts of men are gladdened, their strength recruited, and the whole man strengthened, so by the blood of our Lord the same benefits are received by our souls."<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.reformed.org/documents/calvin/geneva_catachism/geneva_catachism.html |author=John Calvin |title=Catechism of the Church of Geneva |year=1545 |accessdate=2007-03-15}}</ref>

On the second point, [[Martin_Luther|Martin Luther]] employs a ''[[reductio_ad_absurdum|reductio ad absurdum]]'' to counter the idea that abuse should be met with disuse: "[W]e must not ... reject [or] condemn anything because it is abused ... [W]ine and women bring many a man to misery and make a fool of him ([[Sirach|Ecclus]]. {{bibleverse-nb||Ecclesiasticus|19:2}}; {{bibleverse-nb||Ecclesiasticus|31:30}}); so [we would need to] kill all the women and pour out all the wine."<ref>{{cite web| author=Martin Luther | url=http://www.godrules.net/library/luther/NEW1luther_b8.htm | title=Fourth Invocavit sermon from 1522 | work=Works, American Edition, vol. 51, p. 85 | accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref> In dealing with drunkenness at the [[agape_feast|love feast]] in [[Corinth|Corinth]],<ref name="1Co11:20-22"/> St. Paul does not require total abstinence from drink but love for one another that would express itself in moderate, selfless behavior.<ref>Compare [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1Co+11:33-34, 1Co 11:33f]</ref><ref>Raymond, p. 86.</ref> However, moderationists approve of voluntary abstinence in several cases, such as for a person who finds it too difficult to drink in moderation and for the benefit of the "weaker brother," who would err because of a stronger Christian exercising his or her liberty to drink.<ref>Raymond, pp. 83f.</ref>

While all moderationists approve of using (fermented) wine in the Eucharist in principle (Catholics, the Orthodox, and Anglicans require it),<ref name="AltarWine"/><ref name="EucharistWine"/> because of prohibitionist heritage and a sensitivity to those who wish to abstain from alcohol, many offer either grape juice or both wine and juice at their celebrations of the Lord's Supper.<ref name="ELCA"/><ref name="UCC"/><ref name="CRCNA"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Wine or grape juice| url=http://opc.org/qa.html?question_id=138|publisher=Orthodox Presbyterian Church|accessdate=2007-02-24}}</ref> Some Christians mix some water with the wine following ancient tradition, and some attach a [[mysticism|mystical]] significance to this practice.<ref>Cross and Livingstone, p. 1767.</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=New Catholic Encyclopedia |edition=2nd ed. |publisher=Thomson Gale |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7876-4004-0 |volume=14

==== Comparison ====
In addition to lexical and historical differences,<ref name="Meyers1"/><ref>See the thorough discussion of lexical differences in Gentry, ''God Gave Wine'', pp. 33-104.</ref> moderationism holds that prohibitionism errs by confusing the Christian virtues of temperance and moderation with abstinence and prohibition and by locating the evil in the object that is abused rather in the heart and deeds of the abuser.<ref name="RaymondP25"/><ref name="ProtTrans4"/> Moreover, moderationists suggest that the prohibitionist and abstentionist positions denigrate God's creation and his good gifts and deny that it is not what goes into a man that makes him evil but what comes out (that is, what he says and does).<ref name="RaymondP81"/><ref>Compare [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+15:11,18;Mk+7:20,23 Mt 15:11,18; Mk 7:20,23].</ref> And so, moderationists hold that in banishing wine from communion and dinner tables, prohibitionists and abstentionists go against the witness of the Bible and the church throughout the ages and implicitly adopt a [[Pharisees|Pharisaical]] [[moralism|moralism]] that is at odds with the what moderationists consider the right approach to biblical [[ethics|ethics]] and the doctrines of [[sin|sin]] and [[sanctification|sanctification]].<ref name="Meyers2"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Revising the Practice of the Lord's Supper at Faith Presbyterian Church No. 4, Wine, No. 3 |url=http://sermons.faithtacoma.org/Revising_Communion/Revising_FPC_LordsSupper_No.4_Wine_No.3_Feb.11.2001.htm |author=Robert S.

Abstentionists believe that although alcohol consumption is not inherently sinful or necessarily to be avoided in all circumstances, it is generally not the wisest or most prudent choice.<ref>For example, {{cite web| url=http://www.christianity.com/11546319/print/ |title=Myths and Facts about Alcohol Consumption |author=[[Stephen_Arterburn|Stephen Arterburn]] and Jim Burns |year=2007 |accessdate=2007-11-19 |quote=For the general population, no specific Scriptures forbid wine consumption in small amounts ...

Some reasons commonly given for voluntary abstention are:
# The Bible warns that alcohol can hinder moral discretion. As [[#Drunkenness|discussed above]], Proverbs 31:4-5 warns kings and rulers that they might "forget what is decreed, and pervert the rights of all the afflicted." Some abstentionists speak of alcohol as "corrupt[ing]" the body and as a substance that can "impair my judgment and further distract me from God’s will for my life."<ref name="Land">{{cite web | author=[[Richard_Land|Richard Land]] | url=http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23678 | title=FIRST-PERSON: The great alcohol debate | publisher=[[Baptist_Press|Baptist Press]] | date=2006-07-24 | accessdate=2013-04-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606002004/http://www.bpnews.net/bpnews.asp?id=23678 | archive-date=2013-06-06 | dead-url=yes }}</ref>
# Christians must be sensitive to the "weaker brother", that is, the Christian who (incorrectly, in the abstentionist's view) believes imbibing to be a sin. On this point MacArthur says, "[T]he primary reason I don't do a lot of things I could do, including drinking wine or any alcoholic beverage, [is] because I know some believers would be offended by it ... [M]any Christians will drink their beer and wine and flaunt their liberty no matter what anyone thinks. Consequently, there is a rift in the fellowship."<ref>{{cite web | author=John MacArthur| url=http://www.biblebb.com/files/MAC/sg45-111.htm | title=Unity in Action: Building Up One Another Without Offending--Part 2 | accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref>
# Christians should make a public statement against drunkenness because of the negative consequences it can have on individuals, families, and society as a whole. Some abstentionists believe that their witness as persons of [[moral_character|moral character]] is also enhanced by this choice.<ref name="Akin"/><ref name="Land"/>

Additionally, abstentionists argue that while drinking may have been more acceptable in ancient times (for instance, using wine to purify [[pollution|polluted]] drinking water),<ref name="MacArthurQ&A"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.enduringword.com/commentaries/5405.htm | author=David Guzik | title=Commentary on 1 Ti 5:23 | accessdate=2007-01-22 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208100335/http://www.enduringword.com/commentaries/5405.htm | archive-date=2006-12-08 | dead-url=yes }}</ref> modern circumstances have changed the nature of a Christian's responsibility in this area.

==== Comparison ====
On historical and lexical grounds, many abstentionists reject the argument of prohibitionists that wine in the Bible was not alcoholic and that imbibing is nearly always a sin.<ref name="SchaffHerzog"/><ref name="MacArthurQ&A"/> Piper summarizes the abstentionist position on this point:
:The consumption of food and drink is in itself no basis for judging a person's standing with God ... [The Apostle Paul's] approach to these abuses [of food and drink] was never to forbid food or drink. It was always to forbid what destroyed God's temple and injured faith. He taught the principle of love, but did not determine its application with regulations in matters of food and drink.<ref>{{cite web|author=John Piper | title=Flesh Tank and Peashooter Regulations  | url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/Sermons/ByDate/1982/330_Flesh_Tank_and_Peashooter_Regulations/ |date=1982-01-17 |accessdate=2007-01-22}}</ref>

Abstentionists also reject the position of moderationists that in many circumstances Christians should feel free to drink for pleasure because abstentionists see alcohol as inherently too dangerous and not "a necessity for life or good living,"<ref name="MacArthurDrunk2"/><ref name="Akin"/> with some even going so far as to say, "Moderation is the cause of the liquor problem."<ref name="Akin"/>
