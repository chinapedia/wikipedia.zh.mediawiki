'''栗树山'''（'''Chestnut Hill'''）是美国[[马萨诸塞州|马萨诸塞州]][[波士顿|波士顿]]西面6英里处的一个富裕的郊区，包括三个区域，分属[[布鲁克莱恩_(马萨诸塞州)|布鲁克莱恩]]镇、[[波士顿|波士顿]]和[[牛顿_(马萨诸塞州)|牛顿]]市。以拥有富丽堂皇的古老宅第、风景如画的景色和历史悠久的[[波士顿学院|波士顿学院]]校园而著称。<!-- Like all [[Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] villages, Chestnut Hill is not an incorporated [[municipal|municipal]] entity. Its borders are roughly defined by the 02467 [[ZIP_Code|ZIP Code]], and it encompasses parts of the [[town|town]] of [[Brookline,_Massachusetts|Brookline]], the neighborhoods of [[Brighton,_Boston,_Massachusetts|Brighton]] and [[West_Roxbury,_Massachusetts|West Roxbury]] (parts of the city of [[Boston|Boston]]), and the [[city|city]] of [[Newton,_Massachusetts|Newton, Massachusetts]].  The portion of Chestnut Hill located in Newton is designated as one of Newton's thirteen unincorporated villages.  "Chestnut Hill" is not a clear [[topographical|topographical]] designation, as the name refers to a series of hills that overlook the 135 acre (546,000 m²) [[Chestnut_Hill_Reservoir|Chestnut Hill Reservoir]]. -->

<!-- In 1986, the [[National_Register_of_Historic_Places|National Register of Historic Places]] designated parts of Chestnut Hill as a historic district for the significance of its landscape and architecture. Examples of [[Colonial|Colonial]], [[Italianate|Italianate]], [[Shingle|Shingle]], [[Tudor_style|Tudor]], and [[Victorian_architecture|Victorian architectural]] styles are evident in country estates and mansions.  The Boston College campus is itself an early example of [[Collegiate_Gothic|Collegiate Gothic]] architecture. While most of Chestnut Hill remained farmland well into the early twentieth century, the area around the reservoir was developed in 1870 by renowned landscape architect [[Frederick_Law_Olmsted|Frederick Law Olmsted]]，[[纽约|纽约]][[中央公园|中央公园]]的设计师. -->
