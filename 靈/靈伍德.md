'''靈伍德'''（Ringwood）是[[英國|英國]][[英格蘭|英格蘭]][[漢普郡|漢普郡]]的一個城鎮和民政教區。靈伍德最早出現在文獻記載是在961年<ref>"Before attempting to explain this name, a note must be made on B.1066, a charter which Birch identifies with Ringwood. The [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56894 VCH. Hants], points out that this charter professes to record a grant of the lands concerned to Abingdon Abbey, but that there is no other record of the abbey holding lands at Ringwood. It also mentions that in the Rolls Series Rimecuda is identified with Ruscombe, Berks. With regard to the last identification it may be said without further ado that the survey renders it quite impossible. Whether the grant be genuine or not, the survey attached to it is almost certainly that of the bounds of the lands of Ringwood as they were in early times. The survey mentions the Avon, Linford and Fulford, and, possibly, Sandford, all of them names connected with Ringwood. The agreement is too marked for it to be taken as a mere coincidence. Birch's identification is almost certainly correct." — ''The Archaeological Journal'', (1930), Volume 84, page 192</ref>。
