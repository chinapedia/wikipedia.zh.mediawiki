<!--==劇情==
While exploring an abandoned [[mine_shaft|mine shaft]] in a mysterious cave, Finn and Jake discover a [[porcelain|porcelain]] lamb. After touching the object, Finn is transported to the [[spiritual_plane|spiritual plane]], filled with grotesque and strange spirits. In this new dimension, Finn is unable to make contact, either physically or vocally, with Jake. After unsuccessfully trying to communicate with Jake, Finn makes a snide comment to the Ice King, who, much to Finn's surprise, can see and hear him; the Ice King explains that, because of his "wizard eyes", he is able to see spirits. The Ice King and Finn soon make a deal: Finn will help rid the Ice King of the strange spirits that plague his palace, and the Ice King will give Finn the secret to return to the [[physical_plane|physical plane]].

Finn rids Ice King's palace of the spiritual creatures, but soon learns that the Ice King never planned on helping Finn in the first place. After threatening to unleash the spirits, Finn manages to secure the Ice King's help; the two head to the tree fort to destroy the porcelain lamb. However, Jake misinterprets the Ice King's motives, thinking that he wants to imprison Finn forever. In the ensuing struggles, the Ice King touches the object and is transported to the spiritual plane. Eventually, Ice King and Finn manage to manifest themselves on the physical plane by focusing their spiritual energies. The two manage to knock over the lamb, destroying it. Finn and the Ice King are thus returned to the physical plane.

"Beyond This Earthly Realm" was written and storyboarded by [[Ako_Castuera|Ako Castuera]] and [[Jesse_Moynihan|Jesse Moynihan]], from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]]. The episode was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Beyond This Earthly Realm| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Ako Castuera & Jesse Moynihan (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=June 11, 2012| season = 4 | number = 11}}</ref> The episode was written to expand upon the idea of the Ice King's wizard eyes, which were introduced in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_2)|second season]] episode "[[Mortal_Recoil|Mortal Recoil]]"; in said episode, wizard eyes were developed as a mechanism to justify how the Ice King saw the Lich possess Bubblegum.<ref name=moynihan>Moynihan, Jesse (Storyboard artist). 2013.

The scene featuring Ice King delivering a [[soliloquy|soliloquy]] about the nature of televisions and [[White_noise|static]] was Moynihan's attempt at being introspective. Fans of the series later took the scene to be an example of the characters [[Fourth_wall|breaking the fourth wall]], which Moynihan disputes.<ref name=jessebeyond/> The spirits in the episode were designed by [[Andy_Ristaino|Andy Ristaino]] and [[Michael_DeForge|Michael DeForge]].<ref name=jessebeyond/> Fellow storyboard artist [[Cole_Sanchez|Cole Sanchez]] provided the voice for the heads of one of the demons.<ref name=akobeyond>Castuera, Ako (Storyboard artist). 2014.

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "B", noting that it was a "bit of a step down" when compared with the preceding episode, "Goliad".<ref name=avclubbeyond/> Due to the fact that the episode's main storylines are similar to plots that the series had done before, Sava felt that "this week’s episode doesn’t feel as fresh as the rest of this season’s output [but] even an average episode of ''Adventure Time'' is going to be on the stronger side".<ref name=avclubbeyond/> Nevertheless, he applauded both the series' "grotesque" character design, as well as the Ice King's material, writing that "Tom Kenny does some amazing voicework this episode, whether he’s voicing his hatred for the shit-vomiting spirits that infest Ice King’s castle or shrieking when he thinks his body is being touched."<ref name=avclubbeyond/> Sava concluded that "even if the story isn’t the most imaginative or wacky," the episode was still enjoyable.<ref name=avclubbeyond>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Adventure Time: 'Beyond This Earthly Realm'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-beyond-this-earthly-realm-80868|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
