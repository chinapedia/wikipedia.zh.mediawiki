The caves are thought to date back to the [[Silhara_dynasty|Silhara]] kings of the [[9th_century|9th]] through [[13th_century|13th centuries]] ([[810|810]]–[[1260|1260]]).{{Fact|date=February 2007}} 
Some of the sculptures of this site are also attributed to the imperial [[Rashtrakutas|Rashtrakutas]] of [[Manyakheta|Manyakheta]] (in present day [[Karnataka|Karnataka]]), the ''[[Trimurti|Trimurti]]'' of Elephanta showing the three faces of Shiva almost akin to the Trinity of [[Brahma|Brahma]], [[Vishnu|Vishnu]], and [[Maheswar|Maheswar]] embodied as one being one among them. This was also the royal insignia of the Rashtrakutas. 

What makes this Trimurti unusual is that it represents the three faces of Mahesh or Shiva. One shows him as a young person with sensuous lips, embodying life and its vitality. In his hand he holds something that resembles a rose bud -- again with the promise of life and creativity. It is this face that is closest to that of Brahma, the creator. The other face on the side is that of a young man. It is moustacioed, and displays anger. This is Shiva as [[Rudra|Rudra]], as the one whose anger can engulf the entire world in flames leaving only ashes behind. This is Shiva the Destroyer. And there is the central face, benign, meditative, as the preserver. This is Shiva as the yogi -- [[Yogeshwar|Yogeshwar]] -- in deep meditation praying for the 'preservation' of humanity. This is Shiva in all the three manifestations of what is conventionally seen as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva.

Other Rashtrakuta sculptures here are the reliefs of [[Nataraja|Nataraja]] and [[Sadashiva|Sadashiva]] and the splendid sculptures of [[Ardhanarishvara|Ardhanarishvara]].
About the ''Trimurti'', historian Grousset points out, "The three countenances of the One Being are here harmonized without a trace of effort. There are few material representations of the divine principle at once as powerful and as well balanced as this in the art of the whole world".{{Fact|date=February 2007}}

The site of these magnificent caves contained beautiful reliefs, [[sculpture|sculpture]]s, and a [[temple|temple]] to the [[Hindu|Hindu]] [[god|god]] [[Śiva|Śiva]]. The caves are hewn from solid rock.<ref>{{cite web

<!-- The rock-cut temple complex cover an area of 60,000 sq ft consisting of a main chamber, 2 lateral ones, courtyards and subsidiary shrines.  The temple complex is said to be the abode of Shiva. The most important sculpture is that of Trimurti Sadasica, carved in relief at the end of the N-S axis. The imag, 20 ft in high is if the three headed-Shica, representing Panchamukha Shiva.
