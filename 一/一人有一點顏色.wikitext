{{作品名稱|name=''Pleasantville''|hk=一人有一點顏色|tw=歡樂谷|equiv-cn=tw}}是一部1998年的[[美國電影|美國]][[奇幻片|奇幻]][[喜劇片|喜劇片]]，由[[加利·羅斯|加利·羅斯]]執導、監製和編劇，[[杜比·麥奎爾|杜比·麥奎爾]]、[[麗絲·韋花絲潘|麗絲·韋花絲潘]]、[[傑夫·丹尼爾|傑夫·丹尼爾]]、[[瓊·愛倫|瓊·愛倫]]、[[威廉·梅西|威廉·梅西]]、{{link-en|J·T·沃爾什|J. T. Walsh}}等主演。

電影內容描述一對現代美國的青少年姊弟，在被傳送到一個以1950年代美國為背景的黑白[[電視連續劇|電視連續劇]]後，將劇中無知的世界及人物逐點變成彩色而充實起來的經過。

==演員表==
*[[杜比·麥奎爾|杜比·麥奎爾]] 飾 大衛（David）
:主角；與1990年代的現實世界格格不入，常沉醉於以1950年代美國為背景的黑白電視[[連續劇|連續劇]]「Pleasantville」中<!---After being transported into the world which he idolizes, David begins to realize that the perceived happiness in Pleasantville is not nearly as fulfilling. He eventually sees Pleasantville not as the [[utopia|utopia]] he once imagined but as a [[dystopia|dystopia]] as the freedom of choice and expression is severely limited. His transformation happens as he evolves from dreamy outcast to leader of the changes that take place in Pleasantville.--->
*[[麗絲·韋花絲潘|麗絲·韋花絲潘]] 飾 珍妮花（Jennifer）
:大衛的龍鳳胎姊姊；<!---is in many ways the opposite of her brother. She is initially dismayed at the absence of sex in Pleasantville, but her own personality asserts itself, and she sparks the initial changes in the town. As the story continues, she begins to understand the limitations she has placed on herself in her own life.  Her reading of a [[D.H._Lawrence|D.H. Lawrence]] novel signified her effort to change herself, and thus, by the end of the film she decides to stay (for a while) in a place where she has changed and to attend college.--->
*[[威廉·梅西|威廉·梅西]] 飾 George Parker
:電視劇中的爸爸<!---George is the stereotypical 1950s working father, with the cue "Honey, I'm home" (a play on the now famous "Lucy, I'm home" directly from the show ''[[I_Love_Lucy|I Love Lucy]]''). He is very averse to change and when the town begins to change, he does not know how to cope. He remains black and white through nearly the entire film until David helps him realize how much he really loves his wife.   --->
*[[瓊·愛倫|瓊·愛倫]] 飾 Betty Parker.
:電視劇中的媽媽，典型的家庭主婦<!---Betty starts as the typical 1950s stay-at-home mother but evolves in emotions much more quickly than her husband. This causes conflict starting with her change from black and white to color after Jennifer recommends [[masturbation|masturbation]]. She initially tries to cover up this affliction but then decides she should not be ashamed. Her love triangle with Bill Johnson also becomes an issue showing that such [[taboo|taboo]] events did occur even in 1950s culture.--->
*[[謝夫·丹尼斯|謝夫·丹尼斯]] 飾 Bill Johnson
:<!---Bill starts the film completely unable to do anything that is not specifically defined in his repetitive list of tasks. This changes however when David inadvertently teaches him a small level of autonomy. This autonomy progresses and Bill begins acting out his desire to be creative and paint. Bill evolves into the central revolutionary in the film going so far as to paint a nude mural of Betty Parker on one of the diner windows. After the town turns fully Technicolor it is revealed in the last shot that George is replaced by him sitting on the bench next to Betty.--->
*{{link-en|J·T·沃爾什|J. T. Walsh}} 飾 Big Bob
:鎮長；<!---Big Bob plays the town's mayor with [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]] undertones. He is the most reactionary in the town and decides that colors are indecent. Many subtle references to ''[[Triumph_of_the_Will|Triumph of the Will]]'' are made in the closing court scene with Big Bob playing the lead. Even he turns to color as he expresses fierce anger towards David. Upon seeing his new face he flees the court room in shame leaving the town to its own devices, ultimately freeing it.--->因此演員在拍完此片後因心臟病發而亡，所以此片為演員最後的一套電影。
* [[瑪莉·雪登|瑪莉·雪登]] 飾 Margaret Henderson
:大衛在電視劇中的女朋友，[[啦啦隊|啦啦隊]]隊員
*{{link-en|唐·諾慈|Don Knotts}} 飾 電視修理員
<!---:Don Knotts plays a small but memorable role as the TV repairman granting David his wish of being part of Pleasantville. While shown to hate the change happening to his town, the repairman is shown with a smile on his face after David turns from aloofness to compassion for his mother.--->
*{{link-en|珍·卡茲馬瑞克|Jane Kaczmarek}} 飾 大衛與珍妮花現實世界中的母親
<!---:David's mother plays the [[foil_(literature)|foil]] to Betty by never cooking or cleaning. David parallels his treatment of Betty by wiping the make-up off her face and consoling her, showing a complete change since the film's start. --->
* [[保羅·獲加|保羅·獲加]] 飾 Skip Martin
* {{link-en|朱塞佩·安德魯斯|Giuseppe Andrews}} 飾 Howard
* {{link-en|珍妮·劉易斯|Jenny Lewis}}和{{link-en|馬麗莎·里比希|Marissa Ribisi}} 飾 Christin和Kimmy
* Kevin Connors和{{link-en|娜塔莉·瑞塞|Natalie Ramsey}} 飾 真正的Bud和Mary Sue Parker
* [[大衛·湯姆|大衛·湯姆]] 飾 Whitey
* Dawn Cody、{{link-en|瑪姬·羅森|Maggie Lawson}}和{{link-en|安德烈亞·貝克|Andrea Baker}} 飾 Betty Jean、Lisa Anne和Peggy Jane

==題材==
<!---Director [[Gary_Ross|Gary Ross]] states, "This movie is about the fact that personal repression gives rise to larger political oppression...That when we're afraid of certain things in ourselves or we're afraid of change, we project those fears on to other things, and a lot of very ugly social situations can develop".<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/click/author-1099/reviews.php?rid=166920&cats=1&switches=best&sortby=rating&page= Review for Pleasantville (1998)]</ref>

Robert Beuka says in his book ''SuburbiaNation'', "Pleasantville is a morality tale concerning the values of contemporary suburban America by holding that social landscape up against both the Utopian and the dystopian visions of suburbia that emerged in the 1950s".<ref>Beuka, Robert A. SuburbiaNation: Reading Suburban Landscape in Twentieth-Century American Fiction and Film. 1st ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillian, 2004. 14-15.</ref>

Robert McDaniel of ''Film and History'' described the town as the perfect place, "It never rains, the highs and lows rest at 72 degrees, the fire department exists only to rescue treed cats, and the basketball team never misses the hoop." However, McDaniel says, "Pleasantville is a false hope. David's journey tells him only that there is no "right" life, no model for how things are "supposed to be'".<ref name=autogenerated1>McDaniel, Robb. "Pleasantville (Ross 1998)." Rev. of Pleasantville. Film and History May-June 2002: 85-86.</ref>--->

==製作==

==音樂==
<!---{{Main|Pleasantville (soundtrack)}}
The soundtrack features many staples from the 1950s such as "[[Be-Bop-A-Lula|Be-Bop-A-Lula]]" by [[Gene_Vincent|Gene Vincent]] and the 1961 classic "[[At_Last|At Last]]" by [[Etta_James|Etta James]]. The main score for the film was composed by [[Randy_Newman|Randy Newman]]; he received an [[Academy_Award|Oscar nomination]] in the [[Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Score|original music category]]. (One of the principal themes, heard for instance immediately after the trial, is similar to the beginning of Newman's later song "When She Loved Me" from ''[[Toy_Story_2|Toy Story 2]]''.  "When She Loved Me" was itself nominated for an Oscar for [[Academy_Award_for_Best_Original_Song|Best Original Song]].) The soundtrack does however feature some contemporary artists and includes two songs by [[Fiona_Apple|Fiona Apple]], who uses a similar scene in her "[[Across_the_Universe|Across the Universe]]" [[Music_video|video]].

The film also uses musical compositions that reflect the theme of change, innovation, and challenging conventional norms. ''[[Take_Five|Take Five]]'' by [[Dave_Brubeck|Dave Brubeck]] presented in a 5/4 time signature, was very unusual at the time of its release in 1959. Composer [[Claude_Debussy|Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[Suite_bergamasque|Claire de lune]]'' is also featured in the film. This piece, among others in the popular ''[[Suite_bergamasque|Suite bergamasque]]'', presented what were radical harmonies at the end of the 19th century that have had a major and enduring influence on modern musical composition.--->
