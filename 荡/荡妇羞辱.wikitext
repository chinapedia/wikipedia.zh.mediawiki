Tolman complained that we've "desexualized girls' sexuality, substituting the desire for relationship and emotional connection for sexual feelings in their bodies." Recognizing that fact, theorists have used the concept of desire as a way to undo the double standard that applauds a guy for his lust, calling him a player, and shames a girl for hers, calling her a slut. |access-date=2014-08-04 |archive-date=2013-10-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022015634/https://chronicle.com/article/The-Right-Sexuality-for/13770 |dead-url=no }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Albury |first1=Kath |last2=Crawford |first2=Kate |title=Sexting, consent and young people's ethics: Beyond ''Megan's Story'' |journal=[[Continuum:_Journal_of_Media_&_Cultural_Studies|Continuum: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies]] |date=18 May 2012 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=463–473 |doi = 10.1080/10304312.2012.665840 |quote=Certainly the individualizing admonishment to 'think again' offers no sense of the broader legal and political environment in which sexting might occur, or any critique of a culture that requires young women to preserve their 'reputations' by avoiding overt demonstrations of sexual knowingness and desire. Further, by trading on the propensity of teenagers to feel embarrassment about their bodies and commingling it with the anxiety of mobiles being ever present, the ad becomes a potent mix of technology fear and body shame.}}</ref><ref name="limbaugh">{{cite journal |last1=Legge |first1=Nancy J. |last2=DiSanza |first2=James R. |last3=Gribas |first3=John |last4=Shiffler |first4=Aubrey |title="He sounded like a vile, disgusting pervert..."
