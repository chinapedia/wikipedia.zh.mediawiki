==生平==
;諾咸頓
Chambers made his Town debut against [[Mansfield_Town_F.C.|Mansfield]] in 2003. After impressing in the first team for 3 seasons or so, he was named captain by then Northampton manager [[Colin_Calderwood|Colin Calderwood]], who later signed him for [[Nottingham_Forest_F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. His only goal as a Northampton player came against [[Swansea_City_F.C.|Swansea City]] in October 2006.<ref>{{cite web

Chambers signed for Forest for an undisclosed fee on 30 January 2007, rejoining former Northampton manager [[Colin_Calderwood|Colin Calderwood]]. His league debut came away against [[Bradford_City_F.C.|Bradford City]]. In his first season, he was mainly used as a substitute.

His big break came in the [[2007–08_Football_League|2007–08]] season. Although naturally a centre-back, Chambers was played regularly at right-back as part of a Forest defence that kept a record 24 clean sheets, eventually earning them promotion to the Championship. He scored 8 goals in total, 6 of them in the league. 

On 4 August 2008, Chambers signed a new three-year contract, keeping him at the [[City_Ground|City Ground]] until 2011.

He began the [[2008–09_Football_League_Championship|2008–09]] season again selected at right-back. Criticism was expressed at his ability to fulful that position at Championship level.<ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/7720044.stm</ref> It wasn't until the arrival of new manager [[Billy_Davies|Billy Davies]] in January 2009 that Chambers was finally selected at centre-back. He shone towards the end of the season, putting on a show of solid displays to help Forest avoid relegation. He scored 2 goals.

He started the [[2009–10_Football_League_Championship|2009–10]] season as he had ended the last and scoring 2 goals in the process. This was not enough to keep him in the team however, and the return of [[Kelvin_Wilson|Kelvin Wilson]] from injury, combined with the presence of [[Chris_Gunter|Chris Gunter]] at right-back, saw Chambers end the season with a limited number of appearances.

Chambers started the 2010–11 season mainly as a substitute, however due to injuries and the poor form of Kelvin Wilson, he was given an opportunity at centre-back. He impressed with consistent performances, keeping Wilson out of the first team and becoming a first choice in the centre of  Forest's defence. He made 45 league starts, scoring 6 goals including two in the 5-1 win over [[Scunthorpe_United_F.C.|Scunthorpe United]]. He was voted Player of the Year for the 2010–11 season.<ref>http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2348106,00.html</ref><ref>http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13280011.stm</ref> 

Chambers' outstanding form in the 2010–11 season has resulted in interest from the [[Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team|Republic of Ireland national team]]. Chambers qualifies through his grandfather{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}. On 5 August 2011, just before the start of the 2011-12 season, he was appointed as Nottingham Forest captain by new manager [[Steve_McClaren|Steve McClaren]].<ref>http://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10308~2410243,00.html</ref>
