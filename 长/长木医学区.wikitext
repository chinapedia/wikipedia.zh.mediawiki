Both intersections have an [[MBTA|MBTA]] [[Green_Line_(MBTA)|Green Line]] trolley stop: [[Longwood_(MBTA_station)|Longwood]] at Brookline ([[Green_Line_"D"_Branch|Green Line "D" Branch]]) and [[Longwood_Medical_Area_(MBTA_station)|Longwood Medical Area]] at Huntington ([[Green_Line_"E"_Branch|Green Line "E" Branch]]). --> 

该地区的主要机构组成了[[医学学术与科学界组织|医学学术与科学界组织]]（MASCO）提供各种服务（电讯、停车、豪华轿车等）。它的19个成员（均位于长木地区）包括以下医院和学校：

<!-- In addition, the Longwood Medical Area is home to the Countway Library of Medicine, which includes a large collection of rare books, and also houses the Warren Anatomical Museum, which contains over 15,000 historical items, including the skull of [[Phineas_Gage|Phineas Gage]]

Historically, the area was once residential housing with small medical institutions interspersed among the large lots. It wasn't until the 1950's when the surrounding area began a slow decline did most of the institutions grow by leaps and bounds to what they are today.  Harvard Medical built a new library in the middle of a connecting street and Harvard School of Public Health built a large auditorium across its Huntington Avenue front that stretched the whole block. Brigham and Women's bought and filled in all of its Francis Street frontage with impenetrable street-wall without exterior doors and windows only above the second floor. --> 

<!-- Various people, including journalists and the leaders of [[neighborhood_association|neighborhood associations]], levied criticism that these institutions turned their back on the surrounding neighborhoods, often walling off large sections of institutional land with mid-rise buildings without public access.  Recent years has seen a marked change in institutional planning with an effort to add public open space.  While surrounding neighborhoods remain [[heterogeneous|heterogeneous]] both ethnically and economically, the presence of the Longwood Medical and Academic Area has inevitably caused a degree of [[gentrification|urban gentrification]] with a subsequent rise in rents and property values. -->
