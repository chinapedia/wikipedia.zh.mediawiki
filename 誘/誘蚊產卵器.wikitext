'''誘蚊產卵器'''（{{lang|en|Ovitrap}}）是用以收集分區的[[蚊|蚊]]產卵數量的[[統計|統計]]裝置，基本上是一隻杯，內有半杯水，模仿適合母蚊產卵的天然環境，吸引母蚊於此器皿內產卵，定期收集這些杯，計算母蚊在杯內產卵數量，製成[[統計|統計]]圖表，分析當地蚊的生長情況。 

這種統計方法，在1970年代的[[新加坡|新加坡]]、[[美國|美國]]、[[香港|香港]]已開始應用。

An ovitrap is a device which consists of a black cylinder with a piece of cardboard. This device is used to control the aedes mosquito population. It can monitor, control and detect aedes mosquito populations thus acting as an early warning signal to pre-empt any impending dengue outbreaks.

The black ovitrap attracts female mosquitoes to lay their eggs. When the eggs hatch and develop into adults, they cannot fly out of the device and die inside the trap. The extensive use of the ovitrap in a community can be used in Aedes population control and effectively reduce the Aedes population in that area. It has been used in countries like Singapore, United States and Hong Kong since the 1970s.

Analysis can be done on the ovitrap breeding data collected weekly to identify mosquito breeding hotspots and risk areas when there is a danger of high Aedes aegypti infestation. Three ovitrap models had been developed to analyse the ovitrap breeding data collected. The analysis results are used to plan vector surveillance and control operations.
