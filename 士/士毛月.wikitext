== 政治 ==
2019年3月2日，士毛月[[2019年士毛月补选|举行补选]]。<!--欢迎协助翻译谢谢！The town is becoming less and less "hidden" as the [[Kuala_Lumpur|Kuala Lumpur]] conurbation (usually called the [[Klang_Valley|Klang Valley]]) expands. The town shares its name with the [[Semenyih_River|Semenyih River]], which is the main river passing near the town. The catchment area of this river is an important source of water for Kuala Lumpur and other parts of the Klang Valley.

The surrounding area is quite hilly, the highest peak nearby being [[Bukit_Arang|Bukit Arang]], 560 m (1838 ft) high. This makes the area home to numerous scenic [[waterfall|waterfall]]s. A more popular tourist attraction in the town is the [[Ostrich|Ostrich]] Wonderland Show Farm. The town is rapidly becoming more accessible, thanks to new highways (such as the [[Kajang-Seremban_Highway|Kajang-Seremban Highway]] {{MES-E|21}} and the [[SILK_Expressway|Kajang SILK Highway]] {{MES-E|18}} ), and more attractive due to new development (including, for example, the [[University_of_Nottingham_in_Malaysia|Malaysian campus]] of the [[University_of_Nottingham|University of Nottingham]]). This transformation from town to metropolis is also reflected in the growth in its population. The 15100 people recorded in the 1991 census had grown to over 45000 by 2000. This corresponds to an annual growth rate of 12.9%, compared with the national average of 2.66% over the same period.

==Incinerator project==
A 1.5 billion [[ringgit|ringgit]] [[incinerator|incinerator]] project was planned for a site between Semenyih and nearby [[Broga|Broga]] by the federal government. In early 2005, a temporary injunction was issued, stopping work on the project, in response to a [[lawsuit|lawsuit]] by residents of the two towns. The project has since been scrapped.<ref>http://www.bernama.com/bernama/v3/news.php?id=271754</ref>
