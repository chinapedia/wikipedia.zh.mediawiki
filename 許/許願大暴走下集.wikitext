<!--==劇情==
In the [[Adventure_Time_(season_4)|fourth season]] finale "[[The_Lich|The Lich]]", Finn and Jake are tricked by the Lich into opening a portal to the multiverse. After the Lich passes through, Finn and Jake give chase in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_5)|fifth season]] premiere "[[Finn_the_Human_(Adventure_Time_episode)|Finn the Human]]". Finn, Jake, and the Lich discover a mysterious being named Prismo (voiced by [[Kumail_Nanjiani|Kumail Nanjiani]]) that grants wishes. The Lich wishes for the extinction of human life. Finn, however, wishes that the Lich had never existed, and is transported to his wish-altered reality, in which he is a peasant boy who discovers the Ice King's magic crown. Finn puts on the ice crown and becomes corrupted by its power, going mad. He attacks the Destiny Gang—who his family owed a debt as established in the previous episode—and put out the fires that they started, but his uncontrolled power causes the mutagenic bomb that Simon stopped to explode, destroying the surrounding area. Jake, however, falls into a [[mutagen|mutagen]]ic [[puddle|puddle]] and is mutated into a creature similar to the Lich, which attacks Finn.

In the Time Room, Prismo reveals to Jake that Finn has been transported to a separate, altered world based on his wish that The Lich never existed. Together, they watch the events in Finn's world on Prismo's television, and Prismo asks Jake what he would like to wish for. Jake wishes for a [[sandwich|sandwich]], but Prismo urges him to use his wish on something important, such as helping Finn. After a conversation, the two decide to hang out; Prismo mutes the TV and the two begin to ignore the events happening in Finn's timeline.

Eventually, the Cosmic Owl joins Prismo and Jake, and the two chat in a hot tub. While reaching for chips, the Cosmic Owl unmutes the TV, and Jake realizes that Finn is in trouble. Prismo explains that Jake can save Finn by wishing, but that his wish must be very specific, as Prismo's wishes have a tendency to have a [[The_Monkey's_Paw|monkey's paw]]—an ironic twist—connected to them. After coaching by Prismo, Jake wishes that the Lich's original wish had been for Finn and Jake to return home. Prismo grant the wish, and Finn and Jake are indeed transported back to Ooo. Finn has no recollection of his time in the [[Parallel_universe_(fiction)|alternate reality]], but Jake does.

Although Sugar and Sanchez were responsible for storyboarding this episode, Jesse Moynihan and Tom Herpich—artists for the show who had storyboarded "Finn the Human—provided input on this episode. The four storyboardists coordinated their ideas so that the resultant two products would work together. This also meant that the four artists assisted each other; for instance, the majority of the scenes with Prismo were crafted by Sanchez and Herpich.<ref name=jessemoy>{{cite web|last=Moynihan|first=Jesse|title=Adventure Time Season 5|url=http://jessemoynihan.com/?p=1804|publisher=JesseMoynihan.com|accessdate=April 21, 2013|date=November 12, 2012}}</ref> In addition, the dialogue between Jake and Prismo in which they discuss romance was lifted, per Ward's instructions, from the 2011 film ''[[Uncle_Kent|Uncle Kent]]'', which starred Osborne as the titular character.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title=The Indie Film Face Behind 'Adventure Time'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/kent-osborne-interview-adventure-time|work=[[IndieWire|IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Snagfilms|Snagfilms]]|accessdate=January 27, 2014|date=October 25, 2013}}</ref>

The music for the episode was composed by Tim Kiefer. To create the song "Prismatic", Kiefer took the song "Lil' Booty Dance", first heard in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_2)|second season]] episode "[[Mortal_Recoil|Mortal Recoil]]" and remixed it to fit with the theme of "inter-dimensional travel" present in the episode.<ref name=prismatic/> Kiefer explained, "I threw my own music from the Season 2 finale '[[Mortal_Folly|Mortal Folly]] / Mortal Recoil' on my turntables and went wild – pitching, reversing, rewinding, scratching and more – transforming Jake’s 'Lil’ Booty Dance' bongo song into a booming, merry-go-round dance celebration."<ref name=prismatic>{{cite web|last=Kiefer|first=Tim|title=Stay Puft Presents...

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode—along with "Finn the Human"—an "A–". He noted that, together, both episodes come together to make "a dense première that evokes nearly all aspects of this series."<ref name=finnjakeavclub/> He was appreciative of the fact that "Jake the Dog" focused "on humor and relationships", and had various "irreverent silly note[s]" that helped balance the episode's more serious story line.<ref name=finnjakeavclub/> Eric Kohn of [[IndieWire|IndieWire]] praised the episode—along with "Finn the Human"—for being "irreverent and narratively engaging".<ref name=indiewire/> He called the collective episodes "the ideal testament to animation's glorious pliability in an commercial arena otherwise defined by restrictions."<ref name=indiewire/> Kohn felt that the show's exploration of "sad subtext"—such as the series' mysterious Mushroom War and the relationship between Marceline and the Ice King—and the characters' abilities to "deny the bad vibes their surrounding world invites" via "cheery songs and vibrant artwork" were some of the series strongest points.<ref name=indiewire/> Finally, he praised the exploration of the multiverse and its impact on the show, noting that it was an "interesting creative challenge".<ref name=indiewire>{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title=Why 'Adventure Time,' Now In Its Fifth Season, Is More Groundbreaking Than You May Realize|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/why-adventure-time-now-in-its-fifth-season-is-more-groundbreaking-than-you-may-realize|work=[[IndieWire|IndieWire]]|publisher=[[Snagfilms|Snagfilms]]|accessdate=February 24, 2013|date=November 13, 2012}}</ref>
