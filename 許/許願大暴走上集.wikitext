<!--==劇情==
In the [[Adventure_Time_(season_4)|fourth season]] finale "[[The_Lich|The Lich]]", Finn and Jake are tricked by the Lich—disguised as the hero Billy—into opening a portal to the multiverse by using the Enchiridion. After the Lich passes through, Finn and Jake give chase. They eventually reach a time room at the center of the multiverse that is inhabited by Prismo, a wish-granter. They arrive just in time to see the Lich vanish after making his wish for the extinction of all life. After a short conversation with Prismo, Finn wishes that the Lich had never existed and is promptly transported into the reality created by his wish.

The scene then shifts to the art style featured in the end of "The Lich". In this reality, Finn Mertens is a normal human living with his family and his dog, Jake, on a farm Finn is called by his mother and told to sell his beloved mule Bartram to pay off the family's debt to the Destiny Gang. While going to town to the sell the creature, Finn and Jake fall down an opening in the earth and discover the long-dead skeleton of Simon Petrikov. An aged and decrepit Marceline—who never became a vampire—reveals herself and tells Finn that Simon gave his life stopping a [[mutagen|mutagen]]ic bomb from exploding by freezing it in ice. She tells them that she has been guarding Simon's body, and the ice crown, ever since his demise so that no one is ever harmed from the crown's power.

Finn manages to steal the crown, hoping to sell it instead of Bartram. In town, however, the Destiny Gang steal the crown as well as Bartram. Finn, furious, riles up the town, who begin to riot, as they are sick of being abused by the Destiny Gang. Finn goes to the Destiny Gang's mansion to confront their leader, Big Destiny. Once there, Big Destiny returns the crown, noting that it is the last possession that he will ever own. Finn looks out the window and sees that the gang is burning the city. Finn races to his home, taking Marceline with him. When he arrives at his house, the gang has already set it on fire with his parents and infant sibling trapped upstairs. Finn asks Marceline if the crown is magic and she tells him it is very dangerous magic. He then puts the crown on his head, and the power begins to flow through him.

The episode features new characters, the Destiny Gang, who were designed to not "really fit in the Adventure Time world".<ref name=jessemoy/> Moynihan, the designer of the characters, was worried that their appearance would be "a little bit jarring", but he was not dissuaded from trying it.<ref name=jessemoy/> Furthermore, Moynihan admitted that the characters were partially inspired by the Japanese [[manga|manga]] series ''[[Fist_of_the_North_Star|Fist of the North Star]]''.<ref name=jessemoy/> Despite being officially boarded by Moynihan and Herpich, Cole Sanchez and [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]]—the writers and storyboarders for the following episode—helped out with various scenes. For instance, the majority of the scenes with Prismo were created by Sanchez and Herpich, whereas "Finn going insane" was the product of Sugar.<ref name=jessemoy>{{cite web|last=Moynihan|first=Jesse|title=Adventure Time Season 5|url=http://jessemoynihan.com/?p=1804|publisher=JesseMoynihan.com|accessdate=April 21, 2013|date=November 12, 2012}}</ref>
