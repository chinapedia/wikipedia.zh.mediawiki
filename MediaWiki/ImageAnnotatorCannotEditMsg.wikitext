[[File:Gtk-dialog-info.svg|16px]] To modify annotations, your browser needs to have the [[:w:en:XMLHttpRequest|XMLHttpRequest]] object. Your browser does not have this object or does not allow it to be used (in Internet Explorer, it may be in a switched off ActiveX component), and thus you cannot modify annotations. We're sorry for the inconvenience.
