'''体验特质'''（'''''Quality of experience'''''，缩写'''''QoE'''''），也称作“用户体验特质”，是对一个客户对供应商的体验的主观衡量。

“体验”是从客户或者最终用户的视角看[[供应商|供应商]]或[[承办商|承办商]]的供应，提问“什么样的商品、服务和支持，你认为是提供给你你所希望或期待的体验感知？”“这是否是[[供应商|供应商]]/[[承办商|承办商]]所实际提供的？”如果不是，“如何改动能提高你的总体体验？”

It is related to but differs from Quality of Service (QoS), which attempts to objectively measure the service delivered by the vendor. It is tied closely to the black and white of a contract and measures how well the vendor lives up to its end of the bargain.

A vendor/purveyor may be living up to the terms of a contract's language, thus rating high in QoS, but, the users may be very unhappy, thus causing a low QoE. Conversely, the users may be very happy with a product or a vendor, resulting in an artificially high QoE if the vendor is not, in fact, doing what he was paid to do, thus rating low in QoS.

In medical terminology QoE is also known as "Quality of Patient Experience," and is a subjective measure of a patient's experiences with a medical practice. It looks at a care provider's offering from the standpoint of the patient's holistic experience, and asks, "How did patient fare after the treatment was concluded over an extended period of time? Did they enjoy a higher, similar, or lower quality of life after the treatment? For how long? How did this patient's quality of life, post-treatment compare with other patients who received similar treatment" And then asks, "What changes need to be made to the treatment to enhance the patient's quality of life?"
