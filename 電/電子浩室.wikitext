===Big Room House===
{{Listen|filename=Bigroom house drop loop 30 sec.ogg|title=Bigroom house drop loop 30 sec.ogg|description=Big Room House的一個範例。}}
2010年代初開始發展，由[[Tomorrowland(音樂節)|Tomorrowland]]等EDM派對開始有名。Big Room House和荷蘭浩室類似，通常包含[[Drop|Drop]]、單純的打擊、規律的節拍、簡單的旋律和合成的[[Breakdown_(音樂)|Breakdown]]。Big Room House的背景音樂如同典型的電子浩室音樂，被視為電子浩室的子類別。Big Room House常常因過度重複的旋律受到爭議，批評者認為它是缺乏原創性的的老套EDM，每首歌都差不多。[[Mixmag|Mixmag]]雜誌形容它是「浩大的breakdown和簡陋單調的美學」。在Reddit AMA中，[[Wolfgang_Gartner|Wolfgang Gartner]]將之形容為一個「笑話」，認為美國娛樂公司和唱片公司、過度飽和的音樂派對，強加了此廉價的音樂到青少年的腦袋中，是EDM的大問題。有名的製作人像是[[Axwell|Axwell]]和[[Steve_Angello|Steve Angello]](現已解散的前
[[瑞典浩室黑手黨|瑞典浩室黑手黨]]，影響前衛浩室甚鉅的成員)，強調EDM需要更多的創造性和實驗性。<ref name=mixmag-bored>{{cite web|title=EDM Will Eat Itself: Big Room stars are getting bored|url=http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/edm-will-eat-itself-big-room-stars-are-getting-bored|work=Mixmag|accessdate=2014-01-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118085704/http://www.mixmag.net/music/the-blog/edm-will-eat-itself-big-room-stars-are-getting-bored|archivedate=2014-01-18}}</ref><ref name=youredm-gartnerama>{{cite web|title=Wolfgang Gartner’s Reddit AMA RECAP, States His Distaste For The Big Room Movement & Claims There Is An "Over saturation" of Festivals|url=http://www.youredm.com/2014/01/08/wolfgang-gartners-ama-recap-states-distaste-big-room-movement-claims-saturation-festivals/|work=YourEDM|publisher=YourEDM, LLC|accessdate=2014-01-20}}</ref>
===Complextro===
即 Complex Electro House（复杂电气浩室），由[[Porter_Robinson|Porter Robinson]]开创。该类型作品的特点是复杂，毛刺感的 [[低音声部|Bassline]] 和在不同音色之间快速切换带来的切片感，因此该类型作品有可能带有 [[芯片音乐|8-bit]] 等多样的元素。涉足该领域的音乐家有{{link-en|Madeon}}，{{link-en|Virtual Riot}}，[[Deadmau5|Deadmau5]]，[[Mameyudoufu|Mameyudoufu]]，{{link-en|Nhato}}等。

===荷蘭浩室===
有時被稱為「Dirty House」，在荷蘭萌芽，由[[Vato_Gonzalez|Vato Gonzalez]]和[[Dj_Chuckie|Dj Chuckie]]開創。特色為具有拉丁風格影響的鼓包製成的複雜節奏，較不強調低音，以及吱吱的高頻合成聲的主旋律。相關的音樂家如[[艾佛傑克|艾佛傑克]]、[[DJ_Chuckie|DJ Chuckie]]、[[Martin_Garrix|Martin Garrix]]、[[Fedde_Le_Grand|Fedde Le Grand]]、[[R3hab|R3hab]]、[[Sidney_Samson|Sidney Samson]]、[[Switch|Switch]]、[[Hardwell|Hardwell]]、[[W&W|W&W]]和[[Blasterjaxx|Blasterjaxx]]。
