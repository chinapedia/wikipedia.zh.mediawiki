'''電路圖'''（英文：circuit diagram、electrical diagram、elementary diagram、electronic schematic）是電路的簡化圖形表示法，屬於一種[[示意圖|示意圖]]（原理圖）。電路圖使用簡單的圖示組成[[電路|電路]]，電路符號彼此連接，這兩種類型的顯示設備之間的連接，包括電源和訊號的連接。電路圖裡各電子元件的位置，並未反應在完成的實體電路上它們的位置。

不像區塊圖或分佈圖，在電路圖中顯示電路的實際使用的連線。 
<!--The diagram does not show the physical arrangement of components.圖中沒有顯示的物理安排的組成部分。A drawing meant to depict what the physical arrangement of the wires and the components they connect is called "artwork" or " layout " or the "physical design."阿圖描繪意味著什麼實際的安排，電線和連接的組件，被稱為“藝術品”或“佈局”或“物理設計。” -->

電路圖被用於電路設計，或是規劃印刷電路板的佈線，或維修電器和電子設備。

A '''circuit diagram'''（also known as an '''electrical diagram''', '''elementary diagram''', or '''electronic schematic'''）is a simplified conventional graphical representation of an [[Electrical_network|electrical circuit]]. A [[pictorial|pictorial]] circuit diagram uses simple images of components, while a [[schematic|schematic]] diagram shows the components of the circuit as simplified standard symbols; both types show the connections  between the devices, including [[electric_power|power]] and [[signal_(information_theory)|signal]] connections. Arrangement of the components interconnections on the diagram does not correspond to their physical locations in the finished device. 

Unlike a [[block_diagram|block diagram]] or [[Integrated_circuit_layout|layout diagram]], a circuit diagram shows the actual wire [[Electrical_connection|connections]] being used. The diagram does not show the physical arrangement of components. A drawing meant to depict what the physical arrangement of the wires and the components they connect is called "artwork" or "[[Integrated_circuit_layout|layout]]" or the "physical design."

Circuit diagrams are used for the design（[[circuit_design|circuit design]]）, construction（such as [[Printed_circuit_board|PCB]] layout）, and maintenance of electrical and electronic equipment.

Circuit diagram symbols have differed from country to country and have changed over time, but are now to a large extent internationally standardized. Simple components often had symbols intended to represent some feature of the physical construction of the device. For example, the symbol for a resistor shown here dates back to the days when that component was made from a long piece of wire wrapped in such a manner as to not produce inductance, which would have made it a [[coil|coil]]. These wirewound resistors are now used only in high-power applications, smaller resistors being cast from ''carbon composition'' (a mixture of [[carbon|carbon]] and [[filler|filler]]) or fabricated as an insulating tube or chip coated with a metal film. The internationally standardized symbol for a resistor is therefore now simplified to an oblong, sometimes with the value in [[ohm|ohm]]s written inside, instead of the zig-zag symbol. A less common symbol is simply a series of peaks on one side of the line representing the conductor, rather than back-and-forth as shown here.

===Standards===

There are several national and international standards for graphical symbols in circuit diagrams, in particular:

* [[International_Electrotechnical_Commission|IEC]] 60617 (also known as [[British_Standard|British Standard]] BS 3939)

* [[American_National_Standards_Institute|ANSI]] standard Y32 (also known as IEEE Std 315)

IEC 60617 originally consisted of 13 parts, from resistors and capacitors to logic symbols and even a generalised drawing standard of connections and bus line widths. It is now published as a subscription online database IEC 60617-DB [http://std.iec.ch/iec60617].

Different symbols may be used depending on the discipline using the drawing; for example, lighting and power symbols used as part of architectural drawings may be different from symbols for devices used in electronics.


===Linkages===

[[Image:Schematic_junctions.svg|200px]]

The linkages between leads were once simple crossings of lines; one wire insulated from and "jumping over" another was indicated by it making a little semicircle over the other line.  With the arrival of computerized drafting, a connection of two intersecting wires was shown by a crossing with a dot or "blob", and a crossover of insulated wires by a simple crossing without a dot. However, there was a danger of confusing these two representations if the dot was drawn too small or omitted. Modern practice is to avoid using the "crossover with dot" symbol, and to draw the wires meeting at two points instead of one. It is also common to use a hybrid style, showing connections as a cross with a dot while insulated crossings use the semicircle.


==Reference designators==

On a circuit diagram, the symbols for components are labelled with a descriptor (or [[reference_designator|reference designator]]) matching that on the list of parts. For example, C1 is the first [[capacitor|capacitor]], L1 is the first [[inductor|inductor]], Q1 is the first [[transistor|transistor]], and R1 is the first [[resistor|resistor]] (note that this is not written as a subscript, as in R<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>1</sub>,…). Often the value or type designation of the component is given on the diagram beside the part, but detailed specifications would go on the parts list.

Detailed rules for reference designations are provided in the International standard [[IEC_61346|IEC 61346]].

==Organization of drawings==

It is a usual although not universal convention that schematic drawings are organized on the page from left to right and top to bottom in the same sequence as the flow of the main signal or power path.  For example, a schematic for a radio receiver might start with the antenna input at the left of the page and end with the loudspeaker at the right.  Positive power supply connections for each stage would be shown towards the top of the page, with grounds, negative supplies, or other return paths towards the bottom.  Schematic drawings intended for maintenance may have the principle signal paths highlighted to assist in understanding the signal flow through the circuit.   More complex devices have multi-page schematics and must rely on cross-reference symbols to show the flow of signals between the different sheets of the drawing.

Detailed rules for the preparation of circuit diagrams (and other document kinds used in electrotechnology) are provided in the International standard [[International_Electrotechnical_Commission|IEC]] 61082-1.

[[Relay_logic|Relay logic]] line diagrams (also called [[ladder_logic|ladder logic]] diagrams) use another common standardized convention for organizing schematic drawings, with a vertical power supply "rail" on the left and another on the right, and components strung between them like the rungs of a ladder.

==Artwork==

[[Image:Rats_nest_diagram.JPG|right]]

Once the schematic has been made, it is converted into a layout that can be fabricated onto a printed circuit board (PCB). The layout is usually started by the process of schematic capture. The result is what is known as a rat's nest. The rat's nest is a jumble of wires (lines) criss-crossing each other to their destination nodes. These wires are routed either manually or by the use of electronics design automation (EDA) tools. The EDA tools arrange and rearrange the placement of components and finds paths for tracks to connect various nodes. This results in the final [[Integrated_circuit_layout|layout]] artwork for the [[integrated_circuit|integrated circuit]] or [[printed_circuit_board|printed circuit board]].<ref>

A generalized design flow would be as:

:Schematic → Schematic capture → Rat's nest → Routing → Artwork → PCB development & etching → Component mounting → Testing
