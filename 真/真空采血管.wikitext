'''真空采血管'''（'''Vacutainer'''）是一种真空无菌玻璃或塑料管封闭的血液收集管，管内的真空促进预定的液体量疏入。这种真空管通常用来静脉采血，也有的用来收集尿液样本。真空管管壁有时会有一层添加剂来帮助稳定和保存样本。

真空采血管由[[碧迪医疗|碧迪医疗]]的Joseph Kleiner于1947年发明<ref name=Rosenfeld_2000>{{cite journal | author = Rosenfeld L | title = A golden age of clinical chemistry: 1948–1960 | journal = Clin Chem | volume = 46 | issue = 10 | pages = 1705–14 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11017957 | url = http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/46/10/1705 | access-date = 2015-10-04 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607111110/http://www.clinchem.org/cgi/content/full/46/10/1705 | archive-date = 2011-06-07 | dead-url = yes }}</ref> ，Vacutainer是碧迪医疗销售真空采血管的商标名。

==Principles==
[[File:USMC-11162010-M-4178N-181.jpg|right]]s.]]
Vacutainer [[hypodermic_needle|needle]] are double ended, with one side being encased in a thin rubber coating for safety. When the needle is screwed into the translucent plastic needle holder, the rubber needle is inside the holder, and the exposed needle will be inserted into the vein. When a Vacutainer tube is inserted into the holder, its rubber cap is punctured by the inner needle and the vacuum in the tube pulls blood through the needle and into the tube. The filled tube is then removed and another can be inserted and filled the same way. The amount of air evacuated from the tube predetermines how much blood will fill the tube before blood stops flowing. 

Each tube is topped with a color-coded plastic or rubber cap. Tubes often include additives that mix with the blood when collected, and the color of each tube's plastic cap indicates which additives it contains.

Blood collection tubes expire because over time the vacuum is lost and blood will not be drawn into the tube when the needle punctures the cap.
== Types of tubes ==

Vacutainer tubes may contain additional substances that preserve blood for processing in a [[medical_laboratory|medical laboratory]]. Using the wrong tube may make the blood sample unusable for the intended purpose. These additives are typically thin film coatings applied using an [[ultrasonic_nozzle|ultrasonic nozzle]].

The additives may include [[anticoagulant|anticoagulant]]s ([[EDTA|EDTA]], [[sodium_citrate|sodium citrate]], [[heparin|heparin]]) or a gel with density between those of [[blood_cell|blood cell]]s and [[blood_plasma|blood plasma]]. Additionally, some tubes contain additives that preserve certain components of or substances within the blood, such as glucose. When a tube is [[centrifuge|centrifuge]]d, the materials within are separated by density, with the blood cells sinking to the bottom and the [[blood_plasma|plasma or serum]] accumulating at the top. Tubes containing gel can be easily handled and transported after centrifugation without the blood cells and serum mixing.

The term ''order of draw'' refers to the sequence in which tubes should be filled. The needle which pierces the tubes can carry additives from one tube into the next, so the sequence is standardized so that any cross-contamination of additives will not affect laboratory results.<ref name="utah"/>

===Containers containing coagulants===
*Gold or "tiger" red/black top: clot activator and gel for serum separation
*Red top (plastic, not glass): clot activator but no serum separation gel
*Orange or grey/yellow "tiger" top: [[thrombin|thrombin]], a rapid clot activator, for stat serum testing

===Containers containing anticoagulants===
* Green: sodium [[heparin|heparin]] or lithium heparin used for plasma determinations in [[clinical_chemistry|clinical chemistry]] (e.g. [[urea|urea]] and [[electrolyte|electrolyte]] determination).  Sodium heparin collection tubes are the classically preferred tube for peripheral blood or bone marrow for cytogenetic studies.  Lithium heparin is considered suboptimal for cytogenetics.{{cn|date=April 2017}}
* Light green or green/gray "tiger": for plasma determinations.
* Purple or lavender: K<sub>2</sub> [[EDTA|EDTA]]. This is a strong anticoagulant and these tubes are usually used for [[complete_blood_count|complete blood count]]s (CBC). Lavender top tubes are generally used when whole blood is needed for analysis. Can also be used for some blood bank procedures such as blood type and screen.  EDTA tubes are preferred by most molecular genetics laboratories for molecular genetic studies (DNA or RNA).{{cn|date=April 2017}}
* Grey: sodium [[fluoride|fluoride]] and [[oxalate|oxalate]]. Fluoride prevents enzymes in the blood from working, by preventing glycolysis so a substrate such as [[glucose|glucose]] will not be gradually used up during storage. Oxalate is an anticoagulant.
* Light blue: sodium [[citrate|citrate]]. Citrate is a reversible anticoagulant, and these tubes are used for [[coagulation|coagulation]] assays. 
* Dark blue: EDTA. These tubes are used for trace metal analysis.
* Black: used for Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR).

===Other===
* Red (glass): contains no additives.  
* Light yellow: contains sodium polyanethol sulfonate (SPS). Used for blood culture specimens or [[acid-citrate-dextrose|acid-citrate-dextrose]] (ACD), used for blood bank studies, [[HLA_phenotyping|HLA phenotyping]], and [[DNA_paternity_testing|paternity testing]]. 
* Tan (glass or plastic): contains either sodium heparin (glass) or K<sub>2</sub>EDTA (plastic). Used for lead determinations. These tubes are certified to contain no lead.

Vacutainers are widely used in [[phlebotomy|phlebotomy]] in developed countries due to safety and ease of use. Vacutainers have the advantage of being prepared with additives, allowing easy multi-tube draws, and having a lower chance of hemolysis.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/000456327501200136| pmid=15637911|title = An Appraisal of the "Vacutainer" System for Blood Collection| journal=Annals of Clinical Biochemistry: An International Journal of Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine| volume=12| issue=1–6| pages=151–55|year = 1975|last1 = Ames|first1 = A.C.| last2=Bamford| first2=E.}}</ref> In developing countries, it is still common to draw blood using a syringe or syringes.
