'''聖者約翰座堂'''（'''The Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine'''），是{{tsl|en|Episcopal Diocese of New York|圣公会纽约教区}}的[[座堂|座堂]]，位于[[曼哈顿|曼哈顿]][[晨边高地|晨边高地]]的[[阿姆斯特丹大道|阿姆斯特丹大道]]1047号（介于又名座堂街的西110街与113街之间），是纽约著名的游览胜地，号称世界最大的[[圣公会|圣公会]]座堂（与[[利物浦座堂|利物浦座堂]]有争议）、世界前五大基督教堂。

此座堂于1888年設計完成，1892年开工建设。建设过程中，经历风格的彻底改变和两次[[世界大战|世界大战]]的中斷，至今尚未完成，仍在持续建造中。

== 历史 ==
[[File:Stone_sculptor_at_work.jpg|thumb]]
1887年，一塊面積達11.5[[英畝|英畝]]（47,000 m²）的地被買下後，作為此座堂之用，之後，座堂進行了教堂設計招標，隔年採用了紐約設計師{{tsl|en|Heins & LaFarge|喬治·路易斯·韓司和約翰·拉法吉}}的[[拜占庭式建築|拜占庭]]兼[[羅馬式建築|羅馬式建築]]設計。

1892年12月27日開始動工。此工程耗資相當大，原因在於[[床岩|床岩]]須等到挖至72[[呎|呎]]深時才能開挖。此座堂的宗教儀式始於1899年（在地下室舉行）。

1909年座堂圓頂完工後，原本預定的拜占庭兼羅馬式建築設計被換成法國[[哥德式建築|哥德式建築]]風格，因此座堂的中殿以及半圓形的拱頂房間為哥德式，而座堂圓頂下的十字中心點仍保留羅馬式建築風格。其中一位建築師喬治·韓司在1907年逝世，使得管理人員不知該如何與另一位建築師約翰·拉法吉共事。1911年，座堂唱詩班的席位和十字中心點對外開放，不過其實當初應該由哥德式尖塔取代。

中廊和西側外牆在1925年開始建設，中廊內的第一個禮拜儀式是在[[珍珠港|珍珠港]]被轟炸的前一天举行。之後，主教認為教堂的資金應該用在慈善上，美國也剛好面臨[[二次世界大戰|二次世界大戰]]，人力缺乏，因此座堂的建設計畫中止。詹姆士·帕克斯·摩頓教士在1972年當上座堂的司祭長後，促導了座堂的復工計畫，1979年保羅·穆爾二世教士決定復工計畫開始實施，同時也能訓練年輕人[[石匠|石匠]]的技能，提供他們新的工作技能。1979年，[[紐約市長|紐約市長]][[愛德·寇斯|愛德·寇斯]]在揭幕儀式上語帶嘲諷的說：「有人告訴我一些雄偉的座堂需花費500年才能建設完成，但我想提醒大家目前才到第一個百年階段而已。」

座堂兼塔的建設直到1990年代早期才開始，但又因資金不足停工。2001年12月8日燒掉了管風琴，並燻黑了很多古董。
之後，座堂南側尖塔上大量腐蝕的[[鷹架|鷹架]]才於2007年拆除，同時尖塔的某些部分也被移除了，看起來較矮短。2008年六月才修復完成重新開放。

由於有石頭雕刻家[[賽門·維諾地|賽門·維諾地]]和[[珍·克勞蒂·瑪丘尼|珍·克勞蒂·瑪丘尼]]的貢獻，座堂西側立面入口的雕像在1997年完成，之後沒有任何進展，而新一代的雕刻家也轉往其他計畫。

<!-- The building as it appears today conforms primarily to a second design campaign from the prolific [[Gothic_revival|Gothic Revival]] architect [[Ralph_Adams_Cram|Ralph Adams Cram]] of the Boston firm Cram, Goodhue, and Ferguson.   Without slavishly copying any one historical model, and without compromising its authentic stone-on-stone construction by using modern steel girders, Saint John the Divine is a refined exercise in the [[13th_century|13th century]] [[Gothic_architecture|High Gothic style]] of northern France. The Cathedral is almost exactly two football fields in length (601 feet or 186 meters) and the [[nave|nave]] ceiling reaches 124 [[foot_(unit_of_length)|feet]] (37.7 meters) high.  It is the longest Gothic nave in the world, at 230 feet. Seven chapels radiating from the [[ambulatory|ambulatory]] behind the [[choir|choir]] are each in a distinctive nationalistic style, some of them borrowing from outside the gothic vocabulary.  Known as the "Chapels of the Tongues" (Ansgar, Boniface, Columba, Savior, Martin, Ambrose and James), their designs are meant to represent each of the seven most prominent ethnic groups to first immigrate to New York City upon the opening of [[Ellis_Island|Ellis Island]] in 1892 (the same year the Cathedral began construction).

In the center, just beyond the [[Crossing_(architecture)|crossing]], is the large, raised [[high_altar|High Altar]], behind which is a [[wrought_iron|wrought iron]] enclosure containing the Gothic style [[tomb|tomb]] of the man who originally conceived and founded the cathedral, [[Horatio_Potter|The Right Reverend Horatio Potter, D.D., LL.D., D.C.L.]], [[Bishop|Bishop]] of New York.   Later [[Episcopalian|Episcopalian]] bishops of New York, and other notables of the church, are entombed in [[side_chapel|side chapel]]s.

Directly below this is a large hall in the basement, used regularly to feed the poor and homeless, and for meetings, and multiple [[crypt|crypt]]s.

On the grounds of the Cathedral, toward the south, are several buildings (including a Synod Hall and the Cathedral school), as well as a large bronze work of public art by the Cathedral's sculptor-in-residence, [[Greg_Wyatt|Greg Wyatt]], known as the [[Peace_Fountain|Peace Fountain]], which has been both strongly praised and strongly criticized. -->

<!-- On the night of [[December_18|December 18]] [[2001|2001]], a fire swept through the unfinished north transept, destroying the gift shop and for a time threatening the sanctuary of the cathedral itself. It temporarily silenced the Aeolian-Skinner [[pipe_organ|pipe organ]]. Although the organ was not damaged, its pipe chambers had to be removed and laboriously cleaned, to prevent damage from the fire's accumulated soot.  Valuable tapestries and other items in the cathedral were damaged by the smoke.

In [[2003|2003]], the Cathedral was designated a landmark by the [[New_York_City_Landmarks_Preservation_Commission|New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], however, shortly thereafter the designation was unanimously overturned by the [[New_York_City_Council|New York City Council]], which favored landmark status for the cathedral entire grounds, rather than just the building. However, no move to designate the entire grounds has formed. Thus, the cathedral is not officially a New York City landmark at this time.

In January [[2005|2005]], the Cathedral began a massive restoration that will remain in progress until the Fall of [[2007|2007]]. A state-of-the-art chemical-based cleaning system is being utilized, primarily to remove smoke damage resulting from the 2001 fire.

The Cathedral houses one of the nation's premiere textile conservation [[Laboratory|laboratories]] to [[Art_conservation_and_restoration|conserve]] the Cathedral's textiles, including works designed by [[Raphael|Raphael]]. The Laboratory also conserves tapestries, needlepoint, upholstery, costumes, and other textiles for its clients.

In early November 2006, vandals beheaded a statue of [[George_Washington|George Washington]] near the high altar of the Cathedral and left a dollar bill on what was left of the neck. -->
