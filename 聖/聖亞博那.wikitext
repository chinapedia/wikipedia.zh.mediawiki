'''拉文納的聖亞博那''' ({{lang-it|Apollinare}}) 是一名[[敘利亞|敘利亞]][[基督教聖人|聖人]]，在{{Link-en|羅馬殉道聖人錄|Roman Martyrology}}中這樣描繪他：“教會傳統上，這位[[主教|主教]]，在眾多民族中傳播[[基督|基督]]深不可測的財富的同時，他作為一名好牧人引領了他的羊群，並以自己光榮的殉道榮耀了[[拉文納|拉文納]]以及克拉塞的教會。”<ref name=Martyrology>Martyrologium Romanum (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 ISBN 88-209-7210-7)</ref>

聖亞博那的瞻禮日於7月20日慶祝。<ref>[http://www.binetti.ru/collectio/liturgia/missale_files/crg7.htm 七月的聖人歷（拉丁文）]</ref>

根據教會傳統，聖亞博那是二世紀時，東方[[叙利亚_(罗马行省)|敘利亞]][[安條克|安條克]]的一位[[司鐸|司鐸]]。他向西方傳播[[基督|基督]][[福音|福音]]，被升任為[[拉文納|拉文納]]的首任主教，並領導拉文納附近克拉塞教會。他長期受到迫害，他和基督徒信眾在[[羅馬皇帝|羅馬皇帝]][[韦斯巴芗|韦斯巴芗]]的迫害中（或是[[尼祿|尼祿]]）被放逐。他在途中被人認出，被逮捕後被劍刺死殉道。數個世紀後，他顯現在{{Link-en|聖罗慕铎|Saint Romuald}}的神視中。

而另外的傳說則稱他於[[瓦伦斯|瓦伦斯]]皇帝執政時殉道。

20世紀的 ''天主教百科全書'' 依據教會傳統這樣描述他：
<blockquote>He was made Bishop of Ravenna, Italy, by Saint Peter himself. The miracles he wrought there soon attracted official attention, for they and his preaching won many converts to the Faith, while at the same time bringing upon him the fury of the idolaters, who beat him cruelly and drove him from the city. He was found half-dead on the seashore, and kept in concealment by the Christians, but was captured again and compelled to walk on burning coals and a second time expelled. But he remained in the vicinity, and continued his work of evangelization. We find him then journeying in the [[Roman_province|Roman province]] of [[Aemilia_(province)|Aemilia]] [in Italy]. A third time he returned to Ravenna. Again he was captured, hacked with knives, had scalding water poured over his wounds, was beaten in the mouth with stones because he persisted in preaching, and was flung into a horrible dungeon, loaded with chains, to starve to death; but after four days he was put on board a ship and sent to Greece. There the same course of preachings, miracles and sufferings continued; and when his very presence caused the oracles to be silent, he was, after a cruel beating, sent back to Italy. All this continued for three years, and a fourth time he returned to Ravenna. By this time [[Vespasian|Vespasian]] was Emperor, and he, in answer to the complaints of the pagans, issued a decree of banishment against the Christians. Apollinaris was kept concealed for some time, but as he was passing out of the gates of the city, was set upon and savagely beaten, probably at [[Classis|Classis]], a suburb, but he lived for seven days, foretelling meantime that the persecutions would increase, but that the Church would ultimately triumph. It is not certain what was his native place, though it was probably Antioch. Nor is it sure that he was one of the seventy-two disciples of Christ, as has been suggested. The precise date of his consecration cannot be ascertained, but he was Bishop of Ravenna for twenty-six years.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01616a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia: St Apollinaris]</ref></blockquote>

由於{{Link-en|克拉塞|Classe}}地區的二世紀基督教文獻顯示，該地區基督教歷史可追溯到很早的年份，拉文納第十二任主教Severus參加過公元343年召開的{{Link-en|撒底迦會議|Council of Sardica}}。因此，學者們估計聖亞博那大概最晚於二世紀末殉道，有可能在皇帝[[塞普蒂米乌斯·塞维鲁|塞普蒂米乌斯·塞维鲁]]執政時殉道。
