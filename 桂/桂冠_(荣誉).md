在[[古希腊|古希腊]]文化中，[[月桂|月桂]]（{{lang|la|Laura nobilis}}）是献给主神阿波罗的神圣祭品，而它的小栉会编织成冠状或圈状作为颁赠给[[诗人|诗人]]和[[英雄|英雄]]的荣誉，这种象征也广泛流传至今。<!--"Laureate letters" in old times meant the dispatches announcing a victory; and the epithet was given, even officially (e.g. to [[John_Skelton|John Skelton]]) by [[universities|universities]], to distinguished poets. 

The name of "bacca-laureate" for a [[bachelor's_degree|bachelor's degree]] shows a confusion with a supposed [[etymology|etymology]] from [[Latin|Latin]] bacca lauri (the laurel berry), which, though incorrect, involves the same idea. From the more general use of the term "[[poet_laureate|poet laureate]]" arose its restriction in [[England|England]] to the office of the poet attached to the royal household, first held by [[Ben_Jonson|Ben Jonson]], for whom the position was, in its essentials, created by [[Charles_I_of_England|Charles I of England]] in 1617. Jonson's appointment does not seem to have been formally made as poet-laureate, but his position was equivalent to that. The office was a development of the practice of earlier times, when [[minstrel|minstrel]]s and [[versifier|versifier]]s were part of the retinue of the King; it is recorded that [[Richard_I_of_England|Richard Coeur de Lion]] had a versificator regis (Gulielmus Peregrinus), and [[Henry_III_of_England|Henry III of England]] had a versificator (Master Henry); in the 15th century [[John_Kay_(poet)|John Kay]], also a "versifier", described himself as [[Edward_IV_of_England|Edward IV of England]]'s "humble poet laureate". Moreover, the crown had shown its patronage in various ways; [[Chaucer|Chaucer]] had been given a [[pension|pension]] and a perquisite of wine by [[Edward_III_of_England|Edward III of England]], and [[Edmund_Spenser|Spenser]] a pension by [[Queen_Elizabeth_I|Queen Elizabeth I]]. W. Hamilton classes Chaucer, [[John_Gower|Gower]], [[John_Kay_(poet)|John Kay]], Andrew Bernard, [[John_Skelton|John Skelton]], [[Robert_Whittington|Robert Whittington]], [[Richard_Edwards_(English_poet)|Richard Edwards]], [[Edmund_Spenser|Spenser]] and [[Samuel_Daniel|Samuel Daniel]], as "volunteer Laureates".-->

<!--Sir [[William_Davenant|William Davenant]] succeeded Jonson in 1638, and the title of poet laureate was conferred by [[letters_patent|letters patent]] on [[John_Dryden|John Dryden]] in 1670 two years after Davenant's death, coupled with a pension of £300 and a butt of [[Canary_Islands|Canary Islands]] [[wine|wine]]. The post then became a regular institution, though the emoluments varied, Dryden's successors being T. Shadwell, who originated annual [[birthday|birthday]] and [[New_Year|New Year]] [[ode|ode]]s, [[Nahum_Tate|Nahum Tate]], [[Nicholas_Rowe_(dramatist)|Nicholas Rowe]], [[Laurence_Eusden|Laurence Eusden]], [[Colley_Cibber|Colley Cibber]], [[William_Whitehead|William Whitehead]], [[Thomas_Warton|Thomas Warton]], [[Henry_James_Pye|Henry James Pye]], [[Robert_Southey|Robert Southey]], [[William_Wordsworth|William Wordsworth]], [[Alfred_Tennyson,_1st_Baron_Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]] and, four years after Tennyson's death, [[Alfred_Austin|Alfred Austin]]. The office took on a new luster from the personal distinction of Southey, Wordsworth and Tennyson; it had fallen into contempt before Southey, and on Tennyson's death there was a considerable feeling that no possible successor was acceptable, [[William_Morris|William Morris]] and [[Algernon_Charles_Swinburne|Algernon Charles Swinburne]] being hardly court poets. Eventually, however, the undesirability of breaking with tradition for temporary reasons, and thus severing the one official link between literature and the state, prevailed over the protests against following Tennyson by any one of inferior genius. It may be noted that abolition was similarly advocated when Thomas Warton and William Wordsworth died. The poet laureate, being a court official, was considered responsible for producing formal and appropriate verses on birthdays and state occasions; but his activity in this respect has varied, according to circumstances, and the [[convention_(norm)|custom]] ceased to be obligatory after Pye's death. Wordsworth stipulated, before accepting the honor, that no formal effusions from him should be considered a necessity; but Tennyson was generally happy in his numerous poems of this class. The emoluments of the post have varied; Ben Jonson first received a pension of 100 marks, and later an annual "terse of Canary wine". To Pye an allowance of £27 was made instead of the wine. Tennyson drew £72 a year from the [[Lord_Chamberlain|Lord Chamberlain]]'s department, and £27 from the [[Lord_Steward|Lord Steward]]'s in lieu of the "butt of sack".-->
