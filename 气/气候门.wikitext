== 相關研究 ==
西元2009年發生「氣候門事件」以後，《經濟學人》曾經對於這個議題提出論述。臺灣的研究者從《經濟學人》得知該事件以後，便試圖對於臺灣自西元1961至2010年的溫度變化進行研究，藉此確認暖化現象是否真實發生。該論者從中央氣象局調閱臺北、臺中、臺南、高雄、花蓮近五十年以來的平均氣溫數據，並且形塑成時間序列以後發現平均氣溫的趨勢是逐年攀升，呈現暖化現象。但是由於考量到城市地區的氣溫變化很有可能是熱島效應所導致，所以該論者便又調閱鞍部、竹子湖、日月潭、阿里山、玉山近五十年以來的平均氣溫數據，進行研究。結果顯示即便這些地區已經是人煙稀少的地方，極少受到人為因素的影響，可是平均氣溫的趨勢仍然是逐年攀升。因此該論者以為臺灣的平均氣溫在近五十年以來的變化確實為暖化現象，並非假造。<ref>{{Cite journal|title=〈我們的地球真的發燒了嗎？─以臺灣近五十年以來的氣溫脈絡為探究的出發點〉|author=許世旻|url=|journal=《史穗》|issue=6|doi=|others=|year=2013|volume=|page=頁31-60。|pmid=}}</ref>

| quote = For a few, however, the stolen files were confirmation that the climate establishment was trying to keep them out of the debate. These include the familiar kind of climate sceptics, those who think that the climate isn't changing or that it isn't a crisis. But they also include a handful of researchers who think climate change is happening, but–for various reasons–are sceptical that mainstream science fully understands the phenomenon.

"They were talking about destroying various files in order to prevent data being revealed under the Freedom of Information Act and they were trying to prevent other dissenting scientists from having their articles published in learned journals. "It may be that there's an innocent explanation for all this... but there needs to be a fundamental independent inquiry to get at the truth."
