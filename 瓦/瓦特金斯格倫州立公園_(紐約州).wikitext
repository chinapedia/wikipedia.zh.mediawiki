'''瓦特金斯格倫州立公園'''（{{lang-en|Watkins Glen State Park}}）位於[[美國|美國]][[紐約州|紐約州]][[五指湖|五指湖]]區的[[塞內卡湖|塞內卡湖]]南方，[[斯凱勒縣_(紐約州)|斯凱勒縣]]的瓦特金斯格倫村。本公園在1863年開放，時為私人營運的觀光區，直到1906年紐約州政府將其購入。<!-- Since 1924, it has been managed by the Finger Lakes Region of the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation.--><ref name=guide />

[[File:Watkins_Glen_01_Jacob's_Ladder.jpg|thumb]]
公園的核心為格倫溪所侵蝕出來的峽谷，深達 {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=mid|}} 。在冰河時期，冰河主流侵蝕出了塞內卡峽谷，而冰河支流形成的支流峽谷底部較高，在硬岩層上造成的落差形成了急流與瀑布。此處的岩石是[[泥盆紀|泥盆紀]]形成的沉積岩，主要是較軟的頁岩，有些岩層則是較硬的砂岩與石灰岩。

公園裡有三條步道，開放時間從五月中旬到十一月上旬。南緣步道與印第安步道行經峽谷的林地邊緣，峽谷步道則最靠近溪流，有800多階的階梯與石造橋梁，可行經、跨越瀑布或由瀑布後方通過。這些步道與五指湖步道系統（於紐約州境內長達 800英里（1280公里）的步道系統）相連。<ref name=guide>"Watkins Glen State Park", visitor's guide, New York State Office of Parks, Recreation, and Historic Preservation, Finger Lakes Region (2012)</ref>

==活動設施==

公園有露營區、野餐桌、涼亭、食物販賣、遊戲場、禮品店、游泳池、露營車營地、淋浴間，並有釣魚、健行、滑雪以及其他休閒活動。入園費為每部車每天8美元，公園全年開放，但並非所有設施皆為全年開放使用。<ref name=guide />

[[File:Pleistocene_north_ice_map.jpg|thumb]]

During the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene]] era, a vast area was covered by ice during the maximum extent of glacial ice in the north polar area.<ref>Schlee, J. (2000, 02 15). [http://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/continents/ "Our changing continent"]</ref> This is important because of the role glaciers played in the creation of the [[Finger_Lakes|Finger Lakes]] region. The Watkins Glen area is a small part of the [[Finger_Lakes|Finger Lakes]] region, a region shaped by glaciation during the movement of the [[Laurentide|Laurentide]] and Wisconsin ice sheets. The area and process of its formation is best described as seen on the Finger Lakes Wiki under the Geology section, which reads as follows:

<blockquote>"The lakes originated as a series of northward-flowing streams. Around two million years ago the first of many continental glaciers of the Laurentide Ice Sheet moved southward from the Hudson Bay area, initiating the Pleistocene glaciation. These glaciers widened, deepened and accentuated the existing river valleys. The glacial debris, possibly terminal moraine, left behind by the receding ice, acted as dams, allowing lakes to form. Despite the deep erosion of the valleys, the surrounding uplands show little evidence of glaciation, suggesting that the ice was thin, or at least unable to cause much erosion at these higher altitudes. The deep cutting by the ice left some tributaries hanging high above the lakes—both Seneca and Cayuga have tributaries hanging as much as   120 m above the valley floors."<ref>Sam, E. (02, 2014 24). "Finger lakes"</ref></blockquote>

[[Watkins_Glen|Watkins Glen]] State Park is a prime example of the effects of this [[glaciation|glaciation]], as glaciers moved through this region the [[Finger_Lakes|Finger Lakes]] were carved out of the surrounding land.  As a direct result of glacial melting widening and deepening the streams in these areas the surrounding lands eroded, leaving low lying valley lakes with surrounding streams that still run into these valleys. Over time the streams running into these valleys eroded the land that they ran over, sending sediment downstream and digging down into the harder rock layers of the land. This erosion was not a uniform process, as the different layers of rock were eroded they created increased stream gradient and many unique erosional features. The results of this erosion are areas such as [[Watkins_Glen|Watkins Glen]] State Park, this area was turned into a tourist attraction in 1863 based upon the erosional features of the area. Watkins Glen state park boasts nineteen waterfalls spaced along a trail roughly two miles long, these waterfalls would not be possible in this area if it were not for the glacial and erosional history of the area.<ref>[http://www.fingerlakes.org/things-to-do/nature-parks/watkins-glen-state-park "Watkins Glen State Park"] Finger Lakes Tourism Alliance, n.d. Retrieved: February 20, 2014</ref> The 1,000 acre park consists of mostly [[shale|shale]], [[limestone|limestone]], and [[sandstone|sandstone]], these types of rock erode at different speeds, leaving behind waterfalls and pools of water. According to a glacial erosion study completed in 2011 sandstone erodes more quickly than limestone, thus the sandstone in this area must have eroded first, leaving the limestone base.<ref>
