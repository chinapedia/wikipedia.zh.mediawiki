'''里雄莱锡安''' （[[希伯来语|希伯来语]]： ''' ראשון לציון'''  ；阿拉伯语：'''ريشون لتسيون'''）<!-- first for Zion -->，又简称为里雄，是[[以色列|以色列]]中区的一座城市，紧靠[[特拉维夫|特拉维夫]]的南面，属于特拉维夫大都市区的一部分（[[Gush_Dan|Gush Dan]]）。它是以色列第四大城市，拥有221,500人口（2006年）。现任市长是Meir Nitzan。

==历史==

该市由来自乌克兰哈尔科夫的10名犹太复国主义成员创建于1882年7月31日，<!--  Led by [[Zalman_David_Levontin|Zalman David Levontin]], they purchased 835 acres (3.4 km²) of land south-east of present-day [[Tel_Aviv|Tel Aviv]] for this purpose near an [[Arab|Arab]] village named [[Eyun_Kara|Eyun Kara]]. Along with [[Petah_Tikva|Petah Tikva]], it is considered the first Zionist settlement in Palestine and its founders were members of the First [[Aliya|Aliya]]. The land was owned by Tzvi Leventine and was purchased by the "Pioneers of Jewish Settlement Committee" that was formed in [[Jaffa,_Israel|Jaffa]], the port of arrival for many of the immigrants to the area.

The new settlers faced a lot of difficulties: sandy soil, lack of water, poverty, and lack of agricultural experience. After the digging of the Great Well and a wave of new settlers arriving (members of another Zionist group, the [[Biluim|Biluim]]), the new settlement started to develop. Soon, Baron [[Edmond_James_de_Rothschild|Edmond James de Rothschild]] gained control of the settlement and helped develop its agriculture, citrus fruit ("Pri Adar"), and wine industry - [[Carmel_Winery|Carmel Winery]].

Ri’shōn le-Tsiyyōn, which literally means ‘first to Zion’, was a pioneer not only in erecting houses but also in cultural life. The first Hebrew school was founded in Ri’shōn in [[1886|1886]], as was the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[kindergarten|kindergarten]] in [[1899|1899]]. In 1886, construction began on the Ri’shōn winery.

The population numbered 266 in [[1890|1890]]. Five years later it increased to 450, and by [[1898|1898]] rose to 531. -->

===名称===

<!-- The name Rishon LeZion literally means "First to Zion", it was chosen because of the [[Hebrew_Bible|biblical]] verse:
:: ''"First to Zion are they, and I shall give herald to Jerusalem" - "ראשון לציון הנה הינם, ולירושלים מבשר אתן"''
from [[Book_of_Isaiah|Book of Isaiah]] , chapter 41, verse 27. -->

<!-- ==Rishon Le-Zion today==

Today, Rishon-LeZion is the fourth most populated city in Israel and is known for its high quality of life.

=== Industry and commerce ===

Rishon's main industries are [[wine|wine]], [[construction|construction]], [[service|service]]s and [[commerce|commerce]]. It has special quarters (called ''Ezorey ha-Taasiya'') for small factories and workshops, in order to not disturb the residential areas with noise and pollution. Since there are no residents in the industrial zones, they have become hang-out centers packed with [[pub|pub]]s, dancing clubs and restaurants that are open until early AM hours.

Many shopping centers and [[shopping_mall|mall]]s were built in New West, the modern part of Rishon LeZion, but some eventually closed due to competition. Currently, the two major malls ( קניון ) in Rishon are ''Rothschild Center'' in the old downtown and ''Gold Mall'' (''Kanyon ha-Zahav'') in New West.

=== Culture ===

The city, usually referred to as "Rashlatz" (in Hebrew, short for Rishon Le-Zion) or just "Rishon", hosts the annual Rishon Le-Zion [[Wine|Wine]] Festival, a one-of-a-kind cultural event in Israel. Rishon is also known for its high number of shopping centers, the Amfi-Park (which once held shows of international artists like [[Sting_(musician)|Sting]], [[Metallica|Metallica]], [[Alanis_Morissette|Alanis Morissette]] and more), a zoo, an entertainment center (The Superland), and the promenade on the beach.

''Heichal Ha-Tarbut'' (Hall of Culture) in Rishon is a large and highly reputed modern center for concerts, theatre and cultural events. It has one main hall for shows and two small halls for artistic workshops.
