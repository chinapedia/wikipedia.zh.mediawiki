〈'''嗶莫跳針跳針'''〉（{{lang-en|''Be More''}}）是《[[探險活寶|探險活寶]]》[[探險活寶_(第五季)|第五季]]的第28集。在[[卡通頻道|卡通頻道]]2013年7月22日播出。本集以[[阿寶·馬頓斯|阿寶]]和[[酷狗老皮|老皮]]為主角。在這一集裡，嗶莫不小心刪除了一個核心系統驅動程序，為了潛入到工廠並修復嗶莫，阿寶和老皮把自己偽裝成機器人。但是，阿寶和老皮由保安人員被斯莫追；阿寶、老皮和嗶莫最終碰上了古老又仁慈的半生化人，機器人創造者孟瑟夫·“莫”·喬瓦尼，解釋嗶莫的故事背景。

<!--==劇情==
While deleting files, BMO accidentally deletes its core system drivers. Finn and Jake decide to accompany BMO to the Mo Factory so that BMO can get the drivers re-installed; BMO cautions Finn and Jake that its memory will be erased, so the duo disguise themselves as robots and successfully sneak past DMO (voiced by [[Aziz_Ansari|Aziz Ansari]]) and infiltrate the facility. Once inside, they find the factory derelict and abandoned. DMO and the security SMOs (voiced by [[Paul_F._Tompkins|Paul F. Tompkins]]) soon catch onto Finn, Jake, and BMO's scheme and give chase. The three evade security and sneak into the SMO lounge.

BMO [[hack_(computer_security)|hack]]s into one of the SMOs and learns the location of the core system driver installation deck. Once again, the SMOs give chase until Finn, Jake, and BMO reach the heart of the facility. There, the three meet Moseph "Moe" Giovanni (voiced by [[Chuck_McCann|Chuck McCann]]), the ancient and benevolent human-cyborg creator of the MOs. Moe explains BMO's backstory, revealing that BMO was created to take care of and have fun with Moe's son; however, Moe never had children and so he released BMO into the wild to find another family. Moe updates BMO drivers, and introduces it to his "family" of MOs.

"Be More" was written and [[storyboarding|storyboarded]] by Tom Herpich and Steve Wolfhard, from a story by [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], Patrick McHale, [[Rebecca_Sugar|Rebecca Sugar]], Herpich, and Wolfhard. Art direction was handled by Nick Jennings, whereas supervising direction was helmed by Nate Cash.<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Be More| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Nate Cash & Nick Jennings (directors); Tom Herpich & Steve Wolfhard (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=July 22, 2013 | season = 5 | number = 28}}</ref> The episode was originally intended to have been produced during the series' [[Adventure_Time_(season_3)|third season]], thus the reason that Sugar—who had left the series after storyboarding the earlier episode "[[Simon_&_Marcy|Simon & Marcy]]"—was credited for having co-written the episode's story.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohn|first=Eric|title='Adventure Time' Writer Rebecca Sugar on 'Steven Universe,' Being Cartoon Network's First Female Show Creator And Why Pop Art Is 'Offensive'|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/adventure-time-writer-rebecca-sugar-on-steven-universe|work=[[Indiewire|Indiewire]]|publisher=[[Snagfilms|Snagfilms]]|accessdate=December 23, 2013|date=November 1, 2013}}</ref><ref name=mutoformspring/> However, the entry was pushed back until it was finalized during the latter part of the fifth season; according to supervising producer Adam Muto, by the time the episode was being developed during the fifth season, it had substantially changed.<ref name=mutoformspring>{{cite web|last=Muto|first=Adam|title=I noticed Rebecca Sugar's writing credit for 'Be More'|url=http://new.spring.me/#!/GunterFan/q/484978385206932461|publisher=[[Formspring|Formspring]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014}}</ref>

The character of Moe was designed by Wolfhard, and was based on actor [[Jamie_Farr|Jamie Farr]]. The original ending featured Moe telling Finn, Jake, and BMO to leave because he has to use the bathroom; Wolfhard noted that this was "wisely vetoed" by Herpich and Muto.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolfhard|first=Steve|title='Be More' Spoilers|url=http://wolfhard.tumblr.com/post/56252796313/heres-some-stuff-from-yesterdays-adventure-time|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014|date=July 23, 2013}}</ref> Comedian [[Aziz_Ansari|Aziz Ansari]] plays the part of DMO.<ref name=episodecredits/> In 2011, Ansari had previously been invited by Ward via [[Twitter|Twitter]] to voice a character on the show.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Pendleton|title=Hey Aziz, Hey|url=https://twitter.com/buenothebear/status/80432013064155136|publisher=[[Twitter|Twitter]]|accessdate=January 17, 2014|date=June 13, 2011}}</ref> [[Chuck_McCann|Chuck McCann]] voices Moe.<ref name=episodecredits/> The episode also guest stars [[Paul_F._Tompkins|Paul F.

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "B+". He applauded it for its exploration of BMO, its opening of new narrative opportunities with the introduction of Moe. Furthermore, he complimented both Ansari's and Tompkin's voice acting, noting that the "actors hired by this show have speaking voices that are immediately distinct, and that natural personality helps flesh out bit roles and make them memorable."<ref name=avclub/> Furthermore, Sava wrote that the entry's climax, featuring Moe explaining that BMO was built to understand fun was "an interesting insight into the philosophy behind this series" because the "childlike mentality of fun and play is an enlightened state in ''Adventure Time'', and BMO reaches that every day with Finn and Jake."<ref name=avclub>{{cite web|last=Sava|first=Oliver|title=Adventure Time: 'Be More'|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/adventure-time-be-more-100442|work=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

The episode was later nominated for an [[Primetime_Emmy_Award_for_Short-format_Animation|Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation]] at the [[66th_Primetime_Emmy_Awards|66th Primetime Emmy Awards]], but lost to the ''[[Mickey_Mouse_(2013_TV_series)|Mickey Mouse]]'' episode "O Sole Minnie".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.emmys.com/sites/default/files/Downloads/66th-nominations-list.pdf | title=66th Emmy Nomination List | accessdate=July 10, 2014|work=''Emmys.com''|publisher=[[Academy_of_Television_Arts_&_Sciences|Academy of Television Arts & Sciences]]}}</ref>
