<!--==劇情==
Finn wakes up to discover that Princess Bubblegum (voiced by [[Hynden_Walch|Hynden Walch]]) is now his wife and he is now the king of the Candy Kingdom, however things begin to hint that reality is not what it seems. Peppermint Butler (voiced by [[Steve_Little_(actor)|Steve Little]]) tells Finn that he is trapped in a dream and that he needs to find the King Worm (voiced by [[Erik_Estrada|Erik Estrada]]) and break it. The scene shifts, and Finn is at first being fed soup by Flame Princess (voiced by [[Jessica_DiCicco|Jessica DiCicco]]), then he is in a library. Peering through a window, he sees Jake, who is being given advice on how to wrap a present by a deformed Lady Rainicorn. The two brothers conclude that they are trapped in a dream, and set off, trailing the King Worm.

They eventually meet up with the Ice King (voiced by [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]]), who is trying to outrun giant monsters made up of morphed-together penguins. Finn and Jake then see their father, Joshua, knitting a scarf. The scarf turns into the King Worm, and the duo give chase. On the top of a mountain, they find the worm frozen, and Finn manages to shatter it, seemingly waking the two from their dream state. However, Finn soon discovers that he is still dreaming and that Jake was not actually with him, but rather another figment of the dream. The King Worm present himself and taunts Finn. Finn, however, unleashes his [[subconscious|subconscious]] fears, and the emotional trauma begins to destroy the [[dreamscape|dreamscape]], weakening King Worm's hold. Eventually, the fears become so powerful that the King Worm is defeated, and Finn wakes up in the real world.

"King Worm" was written and storyboarded by [[Steve_Wolfhard|Steve Wolfhard]], Somvilay Xayaphone, and Bert Youn.<ref name=wormep>{{cite web|last1=Wolfhard|first1=Steve|title=King Worm|url=http://wolfhard.tumblr.com/post/29081704731/this-is-the-first-episode-i-ever-did-any-boarding|publisher=[[Tumblr|Tumblr]]|accessdate=September 16, 2014|date=August 12, 2012}}</ref> The episode's story was developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], and [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]].<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=King Worm| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Steve Wolfhard, Somvilay Xayaphone, & Bert Youn (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=August 13, 2012| season = 4 | number = 18}}</ref> The third act of the episode was largely illustrated by Wolfhard. He originally was supposed to have only revised the act, but he added so much to the section that he was credited as storyboard artist. Ward, initially, felt that the sequence was not effective; he wanted Finn's nightmares to be composed largely of "scary, dream imagery", but he later changed his mind, applauding how the section focuses on Finn's personal fears.<ref name=wardworm/> The episode was directed by [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]].<ref name=episodecredits/>

Ward's goal for the episode was "to weird it up" and play off of bizarre ideas and imagery.<ref name=wardworm/> Ward latter revealed on his [[Twitter|Twitter]] that many scenes were inspired by popular "[[YouTube_Poop|YouTube Poop]]s", which are idiosyncratic and often nonsensical mashups which have been uploaded on the video site [[YouTube|YouTube]]; Ward explained that he enjoyed the concept of Poops and wanted to put them in the episode.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Pendleton|title=[Pendleton Ward explaining that 'YouTube Poops' inspired several scenes in 'King Worm']|url=https://twitter.com/buenothebear/status/235108086266855424|publisher=[[Twitter.com|Twitter.com]]|accessdate=February 5, 2013|date=August 13, 2012}}</ref> While storyboarding the episode, Xayaphone exaggerated the elongation of Finn's ears; this was originally going to be revised, but Ward liked that the effect because it fit in with the concept of a dream world.<ref name=wardworm/>

The episode features Erik Estrada, voicing the titular King Worm.<ref name=wormep/><ref>{{cite web|last1=McLean|first1=Thomas|title='Adventure Time' Season 4 Premieres April 2|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/adventure-time-season-4-premieres-april-2/|work=[[Animation_Magazine|Animation Magazine]]|accessdate=October 7, 2014|date=March 12, 2012}}</ref> He had originally voiced the character in the [[Adventure_Time_(season_1)|first season]] episode "[[Evicted!|Evicted!]]"<ref>{{cite web|title=Erik Estrada|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/Erik-Estrada/|publisher=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=March 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode| title=Evicted!| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Sean Jimenez & Bert Youn (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=May 17, 2010| season = 1 | number = 12}}</ref> [[Tom_Kenny|Tom Kenny]] did the voice of Rainicorn.<ref name=wardworm/> The episode was also embedded with references to future episodes. For instance, the large penguin monster, designed by Michael DeForge, later appeared in "[[Reign_of_Gunters|Reign of Gunters]]".<ref name=andyworm>Ristaino, Andy (Storyboard artist). 2014. "King Worm" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> Similarly, "[[The_Lich_(Adventure_Time_episode)|The Lich]]", the fourth season finale, had already been storyboarded by the time "King Worm" was entering into production. As a result, the crew was able to take the model of the alternate universe Finn—who is introduced at the end of "The Lich"—and add him as a mirror reflection in "King Worm".<ref name=tomworm>Herpich, Tom (Storyboard artist). 2014. "King Worm" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref>

At the end of "Evicted!", Finn and Jake encounter the King Worm, who puts them in a trance; the ending of "King Worm", however, seems to imply that Finn and Jake were stuck in a trance between the events of "Evicted!" and "King Worm", implying that the events between the two episodes occurred only in a dream. Ward said in the DVD commentary, however, that this idea bothered him, because he did not want to destroy the reality of the series. In the end, he noted that he wanted to preserve the [[status_quo|status quo]] by making, "the real Finn where he is now … he isn't still dreaming."<ref name=wardworm>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014. "King Worm" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> [[Adam_Muto|Adam Muto]] later noted on his [[Spring.me|Spring.me]] account that, were the events between "Evicted!" and "King Worm" to have existed only in a dream, then "there wouldn't be much point to" the series.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Muto|first1=Adam|title=[Adam Muto discusses the dream theory of 'King Worm']|url=http://new.spring.me/#!/MrMuto/q/359574790920490474|publisher=[[Spring.me|Spring.me]]|accessdate=October 8, 2014}}</ref>

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode a "C", largely criticizing the installment for its apparent randomness. He argued that "being in a dream allows the writers to do whatever they want without any explanation, meaning characters and environments change suddenly and constantly, leaving the viewer as confused as Finn."<ref name=avclubworm/> Sava felt that the only scenes with any [[pathos|pathos]] were to be found near the end of the episode, but even they were "still more focused on bizarre imagery than emotional depth", such as the sequence wherein Finn's fears manifest themselves by emerging from his [[navel|navel]].<ref name=avclubworm/> Sava did compliment the episode's designs, however, writing that "this episode puts the show’s off-kilter design sense on full display."<ref name=avclubworm>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Review: Adventure Time: 'King Worm'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-king-worm-83488|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]|publisher=[[The_Onion|The Onion]]|accessdate=September 14, 2014|date=August 13, 2012}}</ref>

Nicole Klein of [[Geekadelphia|Geekadelphia]], however, applauded the episode's exploration of Finn's psyche, noting that she was pleased with this episode and the [[Adventure_Time_(season_5)|fifth season]] episode "The Vault" because she "love[s] any episode that involves going into Finn’s crazy subconsciousness".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Klein|first1=Nicole|title=Adventure Time: The Suitor [Review] – Come on Grab This DVD!|url=http://www.geekadelphia.com/2014/07/25/adventure-time-the-suitor-review-come-on-grab-this-dvd/|publisher=[[Geekadelphia|Geekadelphia]]|accessdate=September 14, 2014|date=July 25, 2014}}</ref>
