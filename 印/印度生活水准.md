印度的生活水准一直在逐渐的提升之中。最常见的衡量生活水准是按[[购买力平价|购买力平价]] (PPP)调整的人均[[国内生产总值|国内生产总值]] (GDP)。2005年2，印度按购买力平价调整的人均[[国内生产总值|国内生产总值]]为3,460美元。这个数字可以与相邻的中国（6,660美元）相比较。

作为在世界上经济增长最快速的国家之一，2004年-2005年的平均增长率为8%，印度正在快速成为巨大的、全球重要的消费者经济。印度的[[中产阶级|中产阶级]]，人数在2到3亿之间，正在快速地习惯于西方生活方式。如果这个趋势持续下去，到21世纪中叶，印度人均[[购买力平价|购买力平价]]将增加到[[发达国家|发达国家]]的将近三分之一。2006年，22%的印度人生活在贫困线以下，已经比1995年的50%下降很多。印度计划在2020年消除贫困。<ref name="Poverty levels in India, and eradication target"> {{cite web|url=http://hindustantimes.com/news/181_1735396,0008.htm |title="Poverty can be eradicated by 2020: Kalam" |publisher=[[印度快报|印度快报]] |accessdate=2006-07-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515060927/http://hindustantimes.com/news/181_1735396%2C0008.htm |archivedate=2007-05-15 }}</ref>

印度的生活水准差异悬殊，例如乡村地区只有基本的医疗设施，而城市中拥有世界水准的医疗设施。机械使用于建筑工程还是晚近的事，许多工程仍然由数目庞大的劳工在没有机械设备的情况下建造。

近期的经济发展已经使印度上等和中产阶级受惠，但还有相当大比例的印度公民需要得到发展的好处。“国家样本测量组织”(NSSO)估计2004–2005年度有22.15%的人口生活在[[贫困线|贫困线]]以下，已经比1977–1978年度的51.3%下降很多。75%的贫困人口生活在乡村地区（占乡村人口的27.1%）<!-- with most of them comprising [[wage|daily wagers]], self-employed households and landless labourers. 34.7% of 印度最贫困的人口 still live on less than US$1 a day and 79.9% live on US$2 per day.

自1950年代初以来，successive governments have implemented various schemes, under [[计划经济|计划经济]], 减轻贫困，that have met with partial success. Programmes like ''Food for work'' and ''National Rural Employment Programme'' have attempted to use the unemployed to generate productive assets and build rural infrastructure.<ref name="survey"/>2005年8月，[[印度国会|印度国会]]通过了''Rural Employment Guarantee Bill'', the largest programme of this type, in terms of cost and coverage, which promises 100 days of minimum wage employment to 每个乡村家庭 in 200 of [[Districts_of_India|India's 600 districts]]. {{inote|ani-REGB|REGB}} The question of whether 经济改革 have 减少贫困 or not has fuelled debates without generating any clear cut answers and has also put 政治压力 on 进一步的经济改革，especially those involving downsizing of labour and cutting down agricultural subsidies.<ref name="Datt-9"/> --><ref name="jgsy">{{cite web | title=Jawahar gram samriddhi yojana | url=http://rural.nic.in/jgsyg.htm | accessdate=July 9, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051030165723/http://rural.nic.in/jgsyg.htm | archivedate=2005年10月30日 }}</ref>

独立以后，印度<!--  has allocated 将近一半的 total outlay of 5年计划 for [[infrastructure|infrastructural]]发展。Much of the total outlay was spent on large projects in the area of irrigation,能源、交通、通信、and social overheads.

<!-- One of the critical problems facing 印度经济 is the sharp and growing 地区差异 among India's different states and territories in terms of per capita income, poverty, availability of infrastructure and 社会经济发展。例如，the difference in growth rate between the [[States_of_India_by_size_of_economy|forward and backward states]] was 0.3% (5.2% & 4.9%) during 1980–81 to 1990–91, but had grown to 3.3% (6.3% & 3.0%) during 1990–91 to 1997–98.<ref name="Datt-13>{{cite book | author=Datt, Ruddar & Sundharam, K.P.M. | title=Indian Economy | pages = 471–472 | chapter = 27}}</ref>

5年计划 have attempted to reduce regional disparities by encouraging industrial development in the interior regions, but industries still tend to concentrate around urban areas and port cities. Even the industrial townships in the interiors, [[Bhilai|Bhilai]] for instance, resulted in very little development in the surrounding areas.<ref name="bharadwaj-1">{{cite book | author=Bharadwaj, Krishna | year=1991 | chapter = Regional differentiation in India | editor=Sathyamurthy, T.V. (ed.) | title = Industry & agriculture in India since independence | pages=pp. 189–199 | publisher=Oxford University Press | id=ISBN 0-19-564394-1}}</ref> After liberalisation, the disparities have grown despite the efforts of the union government in reducing them. Part of the reason being that manufacturing and services and not agriculture are the engines of growth.  The more advanced states  are better placed to benefit from them, with infrastructure like well developed ports, urbanisation and an educated and skilled workforce which attract manufacturing and service sectors. The union and state governments of backward regions are trying to reduce the disparities by offering tax holidays, cheap land, etc., and focusing more on sectors like tourism, which although being geographically and historically determined, can become a source of growth and is faster to develop than other sectors.<ref name="understanding-2">{{cite paper | author=Sachs, D.
