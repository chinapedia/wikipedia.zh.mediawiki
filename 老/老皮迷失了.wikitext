<!--==劇情==
[[File:Sheriff_of_Nottingham.PNG|right]], a character from the legend of [[Robin_Hood|Robin Hood]], is spoofed in the beginning of the episode.]]

Outside their tree house, Finn and Jake snooze, while BMO ([[Niki_Yang|Niki Yang]]) and N.E.P.T.R. ([[Andy_Milonakis|Andy Milonakis]]) play out a spoof of [[Robin_Hood|Robin Hood]] and the [[Sheriff_of_Nottingham|Sheriff of Nottingham]].<ref name="Sava 2014" /> The two break open Finn and Jake's by Info"> by Info"> by Info"> treasure room, pouring their massive stash of gold out into the yard, as well as the Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant ([[Steve_Agee|Steve Agee]]). BMO talks Finn into spending the money at an expensive resort at Wildberry Kingdom. When they arrive in the [[town_square|town square]], Jake unloads their treasure into the city's fountain. A guard scolds them for this, but they bribe him with a few shillings and a crown, freeing them from the law. Chaos follows shortly after Jake uses wealth to control the residents. When they disrespect her authority, Wildberry Princess ([[Maria_Bamford|Maria Bamford]]) orders Finn and Jake to be arrested and for their money to be seized and melted down. Her punishment is for them to be covered in the molten gold, but BMO and N.E.P.T.R. arrive just in time and save the two.

==Production==
"Furniture & Meat" was written and storyboarded by [[Cole_Sanchez|Cole Sanchez]] and [[Andy_Ristaino|Andy Ristaino]]. It was adapted from a story by [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], Jack Pendarvis, [[Adam_Muto|Adam Muto]], and series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]]. Like most episodes of the season, the episode was produced in approximately nine months. Muto, Osborne and Pendarvis crafted a two-page outline, which was then sent to Sanchez and Ristaino for storyboarding in the course of two weeks (Sanchez and Ristaino are one out of four main storyboarding teams for the series).<ref name="Goldstein 2013" /><ref name="Furniture & Meat" /> The final storyboard was drafted on December 17, 2013. Stamped with the production code "1025-171",<ref name="Sanchez & Ristaino 2014" /> the storyboard was then sent back to Osborne, for any final feedback, and to the network, for any final notes.<ref name="Goldstein 2013" /> The network approved it three weeks later.<ref name="Sanchez & Ristaino 2014" />

==Broadcast and reception==
"Furniture & Meat" first aired in the United States on June 19, 2014, on Cartoon Network.<ref name="TV Guide (a)" /> The episode was watched by 1.9 million viewers, receiving a [[Nielsen_ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 0.4 for adults in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic. It was 52nd most-watched television episode on the date of its airing, according to [[TV_by_the_Numbers|TV by the Numbers]].<ref name="Kondolojy 2014" />

For ''[[io9|io9 Animation]]'', Jason Krell called it "pretty solid",<ref name="Krell 2014" /> albeit lacking in relation to the season's story arc. In his "additional musings" section, he hoped that the war elephant will make a "more meaningful" return, while questioning why nobody in the episode commented on the return of Finn's arm from "[[Adventure_Time_(season_6)#Breezy|Breezy]]".<ref name="Krell 2014" /> Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' gave it a B+, referring it as a [[wikt:throwback|throwback]] to early episodes of the show where specific lessons were taught without dealing with the serial elements of surrounding episodes.<ref name="Sava 2014" /> He wrote that, while "not quite as substantial as recent installments, it's still very entertaining".<ref name="Sava 2014" /> Ryley Trahan of the online ''[[Entertainment_Weekly|Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the use of Ward's "best, most subversive humor", calling it a "great one-shot look" into the main duo's mischief;<ref name="Trahan 2014" /> in the print publication, Ray Rahman summarized, "it's never too early to start saving, kids".<ref name="Rahman 2014" />{{Rp|59}}
