'''老鼠樂園'''（{{lang|en|Rat Park}}）是1970年由[[加拿大|加拿大]][[西門菲莎大學|西門菲莎大學]]心理學教授{{link-en|布魯斯·K·亞歷山大|Bruce K. Alexander}}及其同事針對[[藥物成癮|藥物成癮]]現象進行的[[動物實驗|動物實驗]]，其成果於1980年發表。

後續實驗的結果不一致，一些研究重現了亞歷山大教授的成果，但其他的一些研究則出現不一樣的結果，無法達到科學原則上的可重複性，介紹毒品成癮，而提及此實驗的[[Kurzgesagt_–_In_a_Nutshell|Kurzgesagt]]影片，也遭到下架<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtUAAXe_0VI 你能相信 Kurzgesagt 嗎？]</ref>。換句話說，由於實驗結果難以重現之故，因此有理由認為老鼠樂園的實驗結果，不足以拿來反對[[毒品禁制政策|毒品禁制政策]]。

==實驗內容==
亞歷山大提出一個猜想，認為藥物本身不導致成癮，而在實驗室裡觀察到的實驗室老鼠對鴉片類藥物成癮現象，是因為這些老鼠的生活環境，而非這些藥物本身的成癮性所致。<ref name=Senate>Alexander, Bruce K., (2001) [http://www.parl.gc.ca/37/1/parlbus/commbus/senate/com-e/ille-e/presentation-e/alexender-e.htm "The Myth of Drug-Induced Addiction"], a paper delivered to the Canadian Senate, January 2001, retrieved December 12, 2004.</ref>在2001年，他跟加拿大參議院說早期的研究將老鼠關在籠子哩，並給他們拴上自我注射裝置，而這只能說明說「受到嚴重壓力的動物，就像受到嚴重壓力影響的人一般，在可能的狀況下，會透過藥物紓解壓力。」<ref>Weissman, D. E. & Haddox, J. D. (1989). "Opioid pseudoaddiction: an iatrogenic syndrome," ''Pain'', 36, 363–366, cited in Alexander 2001, ''op cit''.</ref>

亞歷山大教授想要證明，在實驗室觀察到的，老鼠對[[鴉片|鴉片]]類的藥物產生上癮現象，是源自於環境造成的[[壓力|壓力]]，而不是藥物作用。為了證明他的假設，他建造了一個符合野外老鼠生活環境的實驗區，面積 8.8平方公尺，而這比實驗室一般所用的籠子還要大上兩百倍，且裏頭有充足的食物可以享用，同時還有球以及轉輪等玩具可以玩，還有足夠的空間可進行交配和育兒。<ref name=Slater>Slater, Lauren. (2004) ''Opening Skinner's Box: Great Psychological Experiments of the Twentieth Century'', W.W. Norton & Company.</ref>{{rp|166}}在食物充足的環境中，他養殖了16到20隻的老鼠，讓它們自由活動，有正常的社交生活。老鼠先被餵食57天的嗎啡，確認成癮，再被放至實驗區。實驗區中提供普通的白開水與加了[[嗎啡|嗎啡]]的水，讓老鼠自由飲用。實驗的結果看似證明了他的假設，實驗顯示，在進入老鼠樂園後，這些先前出現嗎啡成癮現象的老鼠，其嗎啡水飲用量，大幅下降，在多數情況下，老鼠選擇了普通的白開水，他認為這個實驗證明了逃避壓力是造成藥物成癮的原因之一。

事後亞歷山大教授寫道說「沒有任何我們嘗試的方法‧‧‧能在居住於合理環境中的老鼠，呈現任何看起來像是成癮的行為」<ref name=Senate/>；而在此實驗和一些後續的實驗中，做為控制組、繼續被關在籠子裡的老鼠所消耗的嗎啡遠遠較多。

《[[科学_(期刊)|科学]]》和《[[自然_(期刊)|自然]]》這兩本主要的期刊拒絕刊登亞歷山大等人最初的論文，之後這篇論文出現在《精神藥理學》（Psychopharmacology）這本規模較小但主流的期刊上。開始時，這篇論文的刊登並未引起注意，<ref name=Alexander1>Alexander, B.K., Coambs, R.B., and Hadaway, P.F. (1978). "The effect of housing and gender on morphine self-administration in rats," ''Psychopharmacology'', Vol 58, 175–179. PMID 98787</ref>幾年後，西門菲莎大學不再提供老鼠樂園實驗的經費。

<!--==The disease model of drug addiction==
[[Image:Addictiondependence1.gif|right]]s in the limbic system. Researchers say that opiates cause changes in the [[Mesolimbic_pathway|mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway]] that produce feelings of pleasure. (Image courtesy of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.)]]
It is not disputed that some substances cause withdrawal symptoms after repeated use, leaving the user in distress if they stop using. Where scientists differ is over the extent to which certain substances can be said to rob the user of [[self_control|self control]], causing not only withdrawal<ref name=Jaffe>Jaffe, J.H. Drug addiction and drug abuse. In: Gilman, A.G.; Goodman, L.S.; Rall, T.W.; Murad, F. (eds), The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (7th edition), p 532–581. New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., 1985.</ref>— but a drug addiction, defined as "a behavioral pattern of drug use, characterized by overwhelming involvement with the use of a drug (compulsive use), the securing of its supply, and a high tendency to relapse after withdrawal."<ref name=Jaffe/>

In the 19th century, drug addiction was regarded as a sign of [[akrasia|akrasia]], immorality, or weakness of the will. However 20th century brain research replaced this moral model with a [[disease_model_of_addiction|disease model of addiction]], according to which addiction to a drug is a by-product of the [[chemistry|chemical]] structure of the drug itself. According to social psychologist Stanton Peele, the disease model states that "[t]olerance, withdrawal, and craving are thought to be properties of particular drugs, and sufficient use of these substances is believed to give the organism no choice but to behave in these stereotypical ways."<ref name=Peele>Peele, Stanton. ''The Meaning of Addiction. Compulsive Experience and Its Interpretation''. Lexington: Lexington Books, 1985, pp. 1–26. [http://www.peele.net/lib/moa1.html excerpt]</ref> This view of drug addiction is reflected in the policies of the [[War_on_Drugs|War on Drugs]] and in slogans such as "[[Heroin|Heroin]] is so good. Don't even try it once," or "[[Crack_cocaine|Crack cocaine]] is instantly addictive."<ref name=Senate/>

Scientists adhering to the disease model believe that behavior is "the business of the [[brain|brain]]," according to Avram Goldstein, Professor Emeritus of [[Pharmacology|Pharmacology]] at [[Stanford_University|Stanford University]], and a leading researcher into drug addiction.<ref name=Goldstein1/> Goldstein writes that the site of action of heroin and all other addictive drugs is a bundle of [[neuron|neuron]]s deep in the brain called the [[Mesolimbic_pathway|mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway]], a [[Dopaminergic_pathways|reward pathway]] that mediates feelings of [[wanting|wanting]] and [[motivation|motivation]]. Within this pathway, heroin causes [[dopamine|dopamine]] [[neuron|neuron]]s to release dopamine, a [[neurotransmitter|neurotransmitter]] that determines [[incentive_salience|incentive salience]] and causes the user to want more. Dopamine neurons are normally held in check by inhibitory neurons, but heroin shuts these down, allowing the dopamine neurons to become overstimulated. The brain responds with feelings of [[Euphoria_(emotion)|euphoria]], but the stimulation is excessive, and in order to protect itself against this, the brain adapts by becoming less sensitive to the heroin.<ref name=Goldstein1>Goldstein, Avram. [http://www.aatod.org/1998-3.html "Neurobiology of Heroin Addiction and of Methadone Treatment"], American Association for the Treatment of Opioid Dependence, retrieved July 16, 2006.</ref>

This has two consequences, according to the disease model. First, more heroin is required to produce the high, and at the same time, the reward pathway becomes less sensitive to the effects of [[endorphin|endorphin]]s, which regulate the release of dopamine, so that without heroin, there is a persistent feeling of sickness. After repeated intake, the user becomes tolerant and dependent, and undergoes withdrawal symptoms if the heroin supply is terminated. As the feelings of withdrawal worsen, the user loses control, writes Goldstein, and becomes an addict.<ref name=Goldstein1/>

===Studies of isolated laboratory animals generally support the disease model===
[[Image:Ratselfinject.gif|right]] is not rebelling against society, is not a victim of socioeconomic circumstances, is not a product of a [[dysfunctional_family|dysfunctional family]], and is not a criminal. The rat's behavior is simply controlled by the action of heroin (actually [[morphine|morphine]], to which heroin is converted in the body) on its [[brain|brain]]."<ref name=Goldstein1/>]]

According to Alexander, the disease model makes either of two claims:

*'''Claim A''': All or most people who use heroin or cocaine beyond a certain minimum amount become addicted.
*'''Claim B''': No matter what proportion of the users of heroin and cocaine become addicted, their addiction is caused by exposure to the drug.<ref name=Senate/>

Several decades of [[Animal_testing|animal studies]] have been seen as  supporting these claims. Avram Goldstein wrote in 1979: "If a monkey is provided with a lever, which he can press to self-inject heroin, he establishes a regular pattern of heroin use — a true addiction — that takes priority over the normal activities of his life ... Since this behavior is seen in several other animal species (primarily rats), I have to infer that if heroin were easily available to everyone, and if there were no social pressure of any kind to discourage heroin use, a very large number of people would become heroin addicts.<ref name=Goldstein1979>Goldstein, Avram. "Heroin maintenance: A medical view. A conversation between a physician and a politician," ''Journal of Drug Issues'', 9, 341–347, 1979.</ref>

Twenty years later, Goldstein maintains the same position. In a paper delivered to a 1997 U.S. [[methadone|methadone]] conference, he wrote: "Every addictive drug used by people is also self-administered by rats and monkeys. If we arrange matters so that when an animal presses a lever, it gets a shot of heroin into a vein, that animal will press the lever repeatedly, to the exclusion of other activities (food, sex, etc.); it will become a heroin addict. A rat addicted to heroin is not rebelling against society, is not a victim of socioeconomic circumstances, is not a product of a dysfunctional family, and is not a criminal. The rat's behavior is simply controlled by the action of heroin (actually [[morphine|morphine]], to which heroin is converted in the body) on its brain."<ref name=Goldstein1/>

Against this, Alexander argues that the main evidence for the belief in drug-induced addiction comes from "the testimonials of some addicted people who believe that exposure to a drug caused them to 'lose control'," and from some "highly technical research on laboratory animals". He argues that this weak evidence has been embellished in the news media to the point where it has acquired the status of an unassailable fact, whereas the great bulk of historical and clinical evidence, he says, runs against it.<ref name=Senate/> He writes that, although the use of opiates in the [[United_States|United States]] and [[England|England]] during the 19th century was greater than it is now, the incidence of dependence and addiction never reached one percent of the population and was declining at the end of the century.<ref name=Senate/> In Britain, he writes that heroin has been widely used in medication for [[cough|cough]]s, [[diarrhea|diarrhea]], and [[chronic_pain|chronic pain]] until the present day; in 1972, British doctors prescribed 29 kilograms of heroin to patients, which he writes amounts to millions of doses, yet a 1982 study of the statistics on [[Iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] addiction in the UK showed a "virtual absence" of such addicts.<ref>Trebach, Arnold S. ''The Heroin solution'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1982, p. 83, cited in Alexander 2001 ''op cit''.</ref> Recent research confirms that many people use heroin regularly for years, for either recreational or medical purposes, without becoming addicted.<ref> Alexander, B.K..

==影響==
受此實驗影響，開始出現使用生活輔導的方式，讓成癮者脫離痛苦的環境，來協助戒癮；然而老鼠樂園的後續實驗的結果不一致、實驗結果難以重現之故，因此有理由認為老鼠樂園的實驗結果，不能拿來反對毒品禁制政策。
