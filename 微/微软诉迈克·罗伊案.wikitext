The domain name MikeRoweSoft.com was initially registered by Canadian student Mike Rowe in August 2003.<ref name="zdnet"/> Rowe set up the site as a part-time web design business, choosing the domain because of the [[Phonetics|phonetic]] pun by adding the word "soft" to the end of his name.<ref name="cbs">{{cite web | title = Microsoft Not Soft On Mike Rowe | publisher = [[CBS_News|CBS News]] | date = 2004-01-20 | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/19/tech/main594036.shtml | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | archive-date = 2013-05-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130524015033/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/19/tech/main594036.shtml | dead-url = no }}</ref><ref name="usatoday3">{{cite news | title = Microsoft takes on teen over domain name | work = [[USA_Today|USA Today]] | date = 2004-01-19 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2004-01-19-mike-rowe_x.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-08 | archive-date = 2011-08-31 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110831142817/http://www.usatoday.com/tech/webguide/internetlife/2004-01-19-mike-rowe_x.htm | dead-url = no }}</ref> Microsoft saw the name as [[trademark|trademark]] [[trademark_infringement|infringement]] because of its phonetic resemblance to their trademarked corporate name and demanded that he give up the domain.<ref name="CNN3"/><ref name="CNN">{{cite news | title = Microsoft takes on teen's site MikeRoweSoft.com | publisher = [[CNN|CNN]] | date = 2004-01-20 | url =  http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/01/19/offbeat.mike.rowe.soft.ap/index.html | accessdate = 2008-10-01 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080527162507/http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/internet/01/19/offbeat.mike.rowe.soft.ap/index.html |archivedate = May 27, 2008}}</ref> After receiving a letter from Microsoft's Canadian legal representatives [[Smart_&_Biggar|Smart & Biggar]] on January 14, 2004, Rowe replied asking to be compensated for giving up the domain.<ref name="komo"/><ref name="cnet2">{{cite web | last = Festa | first = Paul | title = MikeRoweSoft sell-off bids going, going...down | publisher = [[CNET|CNET]] | date = 2004-02-02 | url = http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038-5152136.html | accessdate = 2008-10-01 | archive-date = 2013-12-25 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131225105506/http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038-5152136.html | dead-url = no }}</ref>
