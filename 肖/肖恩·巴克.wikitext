Whilst Derby finished midtable in 2009/10, Barker's former club [[Blackpool_F.C.|Blackpool]] earned promotion to the [[Premier_League|Premier League]] leading some observers to suggest he might regret the decision to move to a supposed bigger club. Of this Barker said, 

:"I'd make the same choice. It's funny how things work out. Obviously I made the move with a long-term view to getting in the Premier League. I looked at the reality, everything was right. A bigger club, more money – and I don't care what some say, that's a big thing. I had an offer to improve my life, move back to my family and do the right thing for my two-year-old daughter. People go on about how much footballers earn but it's a short career and outside the top level you need to be careful and do right for your family. I was looking at one day playing in the Premier League and everything at Derby seemed right. "I was delighted for (Blackpool) but there is bound to be that little thought of 'What if?' What [[Ian_Holloway|Ian Holloway]] has done there is beyond comprehension."<ref name="noregrets">{{cite news| url = http://tribalfootball.com/derby-midfielder-barker-has-no-blackpool-regrets-1153351| publisher =Tribal Football| title = Derby midfielder Barker has no Blackpool regrets| date = 2 October 2010}}</ref>
