==情节梗概==
本书开始于一群朋友的归来，包括[[半精灵坦尼斯|半精灵坦尼斯]]，[[史东·布莱特布雷德|史东·布莱特布雷德]]，[[卡拉蒙·马哲理|卡拉蒙·马哲理]]，[[雷斯林·马哲理|雷斯林·马哲理]]，[[弗林特·火炉|弗林特·火炉]]，[[泰索何夫·柏伏特|泰索何夫·柏伏特]]。[[奇蒂拉|奇蒂拉]]，孪生子卡拉蒙和雷斯林的同母异父的姐姐，也应该回来的，但是由于某些当时没有解释的原因，她只是送了一个神秘的纸条。这些朋友们五年前分开去追寻各自的探险。

<!--
他们重聚的夜晚，伙伴们发现他们之中的很多人当作家园的村庄Solace和他们五年前离开时那个平静祥和的村庄相去甚远。Solace has been taken over by a religious order called the Seekers. They are collaborating with the [[Dragonarmies_of_Ansalon|Dragon Highlords]] who are preparing for the conquest of the continent of [[Ansalon|Ansalon]]. Solace is now an armed camp as goblin soldiers patrol the once peaceful village. Tanis, Flint and Tasslehoff meet up outside of Solace, and as they enter the village, they are accosted by a hobgoblin commander, and some of his minions. Forced to fight, the threesome kill Toede's minions, and continue to the Inn of the Last Home to meet up with their friends, and, as circumstance would have it, two barbarians, [[Riverwind|Riverwind]] and [[Goldmoon|Goldmoon]]. [[Kitiara_Uth_Matar|Kitiara Uth Matar]] is absent, having sent a letter to Tanis saying that "her new lord is keeping her busy". 

The Companions soon discover that the Seekers are searching for a [[Blue_Crystal_Staff|Blue Crystal Staff]]. When Hederick, a Seeker, is accidentally burnt when Riverwind pushes him into the fireplace, Goldmoon heals him with her Blue Crystal Staff, a holy artifact of the goddess [[Mishakal|Mishakal]] which possesses healing powers. Upon seeing Goldmoon with the item he had been searching for, Hederick calls for the guards, causing the Companions to flee Solace.  Unknown to them at the time, this pulls the Companions into a great struggle against the goddess [[Takhisis|Takhisis]], the Queen of Darkness and leader of the enemy forces.   

The companions cross a nearby lake by boat in their escape, and Raistlin notes that the constellations known as “The Valiant Warrior” and “The Queen of Darkness” (representations of the True Gods [[Paladine_(Dragonlance)|Paladine]] and [[Takhisis|Takhisis]]) are absent from the sky, which he claims means that the two gods, the heads of good and evil, respectively, have come to [[Krynn|Krynn]]. The next day, the group is attacked by [[Draconian_(Dragonlance)|Draconians]]. These creatures are numerous among the Dark Queen's armies, and often serve as foot soldiers.  The Companions are driven into the woods known as "Darken Wood" where they are attacked by undead and rescued by centaur.  The  Forestmaster charges the group to go the ruined city of Xak Tsaroth, to retrieve the [[List_of_Dragonlance_artifacts#Disks_of_Mishakal|Disks of Mishakal]], containing the teaching of the True Gods and instrumental for the restoration of the faith in the True Gods.

[[File:Dlance001.jpg|thumb]]

After a lengthy trip (on the backs of [[pegasus|pegasi]]) and several encounters with the forces of darkness, the companions enter Xak Tsaroth and eventually meet some gully dwarves, diminutive and stupid creatures. One of the dwarves, Bupu, leads them to the dragon [[Khisanth|Khisanth]], who is killed by the holy power of the blue crystal staff.  When this happens, Goldmoon is consumed by its flame and presumed dead.  However, they find her later resting at the foot of a statue of Mishakal, which now bears the Blue Crystal Staff, having blessed Goldmoon with true clerical powers. The Companions leave with the Disks of Mishakal and Bupu also gives an ancient spellbook (formerly belonging to the [[archmage|archmage]], [[Fistandantilus|Fistandantilus]], who has a dark pact with Raistlin and sometimes lends his power to him) to Raistlin and then returns home to her fellow gully dwarves.  After returning to Solace (their collective hometown), despite their earlier exploits, to regroup and finding it occupied, the Companions are captured by the evil armies and, along with an [[elf|elf]] named Gilthanas, the son of the leader of the elven nation of [[List_of_Dragonlance_locations#Qualinesti|Qualinesti]], are captured and chained in a slave caravan. 

En route to the fortress and mining site of Pax Tharkas, the group is freed by Gilthanas's brother Porthios. They return to Qualinesti and decide to lead an attack on Pax Tharkas to free the slaves of Dragon Highlord Verminaard's control. The Companions journey through a secret passage underground to Pax Tharkas and devise a plan to free the slaves. They also heal [[Elistan|Elistan]], a dying Seeker, and convert him to the faith of the true gods. He becomes the first cleric of Paladine, and eventually the leader of Paladine's church on Krynn, becoming a very influential spiritual leader.  He also is believed by Goldmoon to be the recipient of the Disks of Mishakal, which she turns over to him.  In the carrying out of the plan, they are betrayed, allowing Verminaard and his dragon to attack the Companions. His dragon is killed by another, insane dragon.  Verminaard is killed by Tanis and Sturm. A mysterious figure called "[[War_of_the_Lance#The_Everman|The Everman]]”, who will come into play in later books, would later appear at a celebration following the slaves' freeing, but he fled after being spotted.  According to Tracy Hickman, ''"The restoration of truth and faith are... to a great extent, the theme of this first book in the series."''<ref name="theme">{{cite book

</ref> Dragons of Autumn Twilight is important to the Dragonlance World because it is the first novel of the entire Dragonlance  series.  It was based upon a Dungeons & Dragons session played by the authors, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, as well as some of their friends, some of whom became Dragonlance writers themselves.  The novel was written after the first [[Dragonlance_modules_(DL_series)|Dragonlance game modules]] the book was based on were completed.  Weis and Hickman felt this was constraining and made the novel feel too episodic, so they reversed the process for the next books and completed the novels before the related modules were written.<ref>{{cite web
