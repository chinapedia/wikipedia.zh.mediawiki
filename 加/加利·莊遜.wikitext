=== 球員 ===
Johnson signed for [[Watford_F.C.|Watford]] as an apprentice at sixteen and turned professional at the age of eighteen. He then left Vicarage Road and moved to play football in Sweden for a second division side. After building up a successful football holiday business, Johnson then returned to England and played part-time football for Soham Town,  [[Newmarket_Town_F.C.|Newmarket Town]] and [[Cambridge_United_F.C.|Cambridge United]].

After his playing career ended, Johnson would spend the next six years training to earn his coaching badges and he took his first managerial job at [[Newmarket_Town_F.C.|Newmarket Town]] in 1986.

=== 領隊 ===
;劍橋聯
Johnson was manager at [[Newmarket_Town_F.C.|Newmarket Town]], when he was persuaded to join [[Cambridge_United_F.C.|Cambridge United]] as [[reserve_team|reserve team]] [[Manager_(association_football)|manager]] in 1988. Appointed as assistant manager in 1990, Johnson helped [[John_Beck_(footballer)|John Beck]] organise the U's remarkable rise in the early 1990s, in which they came within two matches of becoming the second club to rise from the old [[Football_League_Fourth_Division|Fourth Division]] to the [[Premier_League|top flight]] in successive seasons (after Northampton Town in 1966). Johnson was briefly caretaker manager in late 1992 and then took charge from 1993 until 1995. Under Johnson's stewardship, the U's were contenders for a play-off place in Division Two in 1993–94, before eventually finishing tenth. The following season, many players were sold in order to balance the books and Johnson moved to take over at Kettering Town.

;凱特靈
After leaving Cambridge, Johnson took over as manager of [[Kettering_Town_F.C.|Kettering Town]] as the club introduced full-time football for the first time in the club's history. However, once the decision was made to revert to being a part-time club, Johnson moved to Watford as director of their youth academy by request of future England manager [[Graham_Taylor_(footballer)|Graham Taylor]].

;拉脫維亞
He was approached by the Latvian football authorities for help, and became coach of their national team for two years from 1999 to 2001.

Whilst coaching Latvia, he spotted the potential of [[Marian_Pahars|Marian Pahars]] and recommended him to [[Southampton_F.C.|Southampton]]'s manager [[Dave_Jones_(football_manager)|Dave Jones]], who invited Pahars for a trial before signing him in March 1999.  He also recommended [[Igors_Stepanovs|Igors Stepanovs]] to [[Arsenal_F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Arsène_Wenger|Arsène Wenger]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Johnson left the job after Latvia drew  1-1 with San Marino. He then returned to England and eventually took over as manager of non-league side [[Yeovil_Town_F.C.|Yeovil Town]].

;伊奧維
In his first year in charge at Huish Park, the Glovers won the [[FA_Trophy|FA Trophy]] by beating Stevenage 2–0 in the final at Villa Park as well as finishing third in the [[Football_Conference|Football Conference]]; the following year they won the greater prize of the Conference championship by a record margin of seventeen points and topping the hundred goals mark too, winning promotion to [[the_Football_League|the Football League]]. Yeovil were immediately contenders in the League and after their debut season ended by missing out on the playoffs by goal difference, they were [[Football_League_Division_Three|Division Three]] champions at the second attempt, scoring ninety goals in the process.

During a [[Football_League_Cup|League Cup]] game against [[Plymouth_Argyle_F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]], Johnson's son ([[Lee_Johnson_(footballer)|Lee Johnson]]) accidentally scored a goal after attempting to play the ball back to Argyle's keeper (who had kicked the ball out because of an injury to a Plymouth player). In a show of good sportsmanship Gary Johnson told his players to allow Argyle to walk the ball into the net to level the score at 1–1, avoiding controversy. Yeovil went on to win the game 3–2, with Lee Johnson scoring a hat-trick.

;布里斯托城
Despite turning down an approach from [[Derby_County_F.C.|Derby County]] in the summer of 2005, Johnson became Bristol City's target when their manager [[Brian_Tinnion|Brian Tinnion]] resigned that September. Yeovil agreed compensation terms and he became City's manager on 26 September 2005. Despite their lowly position of 22nd in the table, City's fortunes turned around under Johnson and a great run of form in the second half of the season saw them in play-off contention, eventually finishing ninth after a run of 55 points from 36 games. 

Johnson won the League One [[Football_League_One_Manager_of_the_Month|Manager of the Month]] award for April 2006. After an impressive 2006–07 season (including an 18 match unbeaten run), Johnson won the award again in March 2007 after successfully guiding his side to 16 points from seven games the previous month. This had set Bristol City in a good spot to contend for automatic promotion, which they sealed on 5 May 2007 with a 3–1 home win over [[Rotherham_United_F.C.|Rotherham]] on the last day of the season.

On 6 September 2007, Gary Johnson and assistant [[Keith_Millen|Keith Millen]] both signed 2 and a half year contract extensions keeping them at the club until 2010.

In the 2007–08 season, he kept Bristol City in the top six of the Championship for almost the entire season and in the top two for a long time; the team were the surprise package of the season. Bristol City eventually lost the play-off final to Hull City at Wembley and were not promoted to the Premiership. Johnson made his players stay on the pitch after the match and watch the Hull City players celebrate as a motivational experience for the next campaign.

In the summer before the 2008–09 season, he broke the club record for a transfer fee in signing 21-year old [[Nicky_Maynard|Nicky Maynard]] from [[Crewe_Alexandra_F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] for £2.25 million. 

Bristol City's once-famous chant of 'Johnson says bounce around the ground' was inspired by Gary Johnson who was quoted to saying in an interview before a league game that he wanted the fans bouncing around.

In September 2008, Johnson signed a new five-year contract with Bristol City, to keep him at the club until 2013.<ref>{{cite news

2012年1月9日加利·莊遜回巢伊奧維任教，時任領隊{{tsl|en|Terry Skiverton|特里·斯基夫顿}}（Terry Skiverton）退任助理領隊<ref name="Gary Johnson">{{cite news |language=en |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/16457867.stm |title=Gary Johnson replaces Terry Skiverton as Yeovil Town manager |publisher=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2012-01-09 |accessdate=2012-01-13 |archive-date=2012-01-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111211422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/16457867.stm |dead-url=no }}</ref>。球隊在加利·莊遜帶領下表現回勇，於19場聯賽取得30分，提早兩輪完成護級任務。

[[2012年至2013年英格蘭足球甲級聯賽|2012/13年球季]]的開局十分美滿，直到9月初於四輪賽事後球隊在[[英格蘭足球甲級聯賽|聯賽]]仍然保持不敗而位列榜首，更在[[英格蘭聯賽錦標|英格蘭聯賽錦標]]一路挺進，最終在南區準決賽才僅負於[[莱顿东方足球俱乐部|奧連特]]出局；而[[英格蘭聯賽盃|英格蘭聯賽盃]]於首圈淘汰[[科尔切斯特联足球俱乐部|高車士打]]，在次圈遇上[[西布罗姆维奇足球俱乐部|西布朗]]亦僅負2-4而出局。但接下來球隊遭遇低潮，在聯賽吃下六連敗，加利·莊遜出盡法寶力求扭轉劣勢。

球隊自2012年12月29日在[[法頓公園球場|法頓公園球場]]以2-1擊敗[[朴茨茅斯足球俱乐部|樸茨茅夫]]後，一口氣取得八連勝，是[[英格蘭足球聯賽|聯賽]]一項球會新紀錄。加利·莊遜獲提名競逐1月份的最佳領隊，但最終由[[沃尔索尔足球俱乐部|華素爾]]的[[迪恩·史密斯|迪恩·史密斯]]（Dean Smith）獲得獎項。

伊奧維以第四位的成績獲得參加升班附加賽的資格，於準決賽兩回合累計2-1殺退[[谢菲尔德联足球俱乐部|錫菲聯]]；2013年5月19日在[[溫布萊球場|溫布萊球場]]舉行的決賽對[[布伦特福德足球俱乐部|賓福特]]，憑藉上半場的兩個入球，最終以2-1擊敗對手，帶領球隊歷來首次晉身[[英格蘭足球冠軍聯賽|次級聯賽]]<ref>{{cite news |language=en |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22499110 |title=Brentford 1–2 Yeovil |publisher=''[[BBC_Sport|BBC Sport]]'' |date=2013-05-19 |accessdate=2013-05-20 |archive-date=2015-04-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415224007/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22499110 |dead-url=no }}</ref>。
