'''加拉太'''是古代[[安纳托利亚|安纳托利亚]]（现在的[[土耳其|土耳其]]）中部高地的一个地区。加拉太北面是[[比提尼亚|比提尼亚]]和[[帕夫拉戈尼亚|帕夫拉戈尼亚]]，东面是[[本都|本都]]，南面是[[吕高尼|吕高尼]]和[[卡帕多细亚|卡帕多细亚]]，西面是[[弗里吉亚|弗里吉亚]]，东部是前280年侵入的[[凯尔特人|凯尔特人]]。现在土耳其的首都[[安卡拉|安卡拉]]也位于古代加拉太省。 

根據《[[新約聖經|新約聖經]]》記載，在[[聖保罗|聖保罗]]第二次福音行程中，他和西拉、提摩太(使徒行传16:6)访问"加拉太地区," 他由于疾病停留在那里（[[加拉太书|加拉太书]] 4:13），使他有很长的时间向他们传讲福音。在第三次行程中，他"挨次经过加拉太地区和弗吕家" （使徒行传18:23）。保罗旅行期间在加拉太受到热情接待。''使徒行传''16：6，18：23:"他们就经过弗吕家和加拉太地区" 和"挨次经过加拉太地区和弗吕家" 。加拉太人变化无常。

<!--加拉太得名于高卢移民 from [[色雷斯|Thrace]], who became its ruling caste 在前3世纪. It has been called the "Gallia" of the East, 罗马作家 calling its inhabitants {{tsl|en|Galli||Galli}}. They were an intermixture of 高卢人和希腊人, and hence [[Francis_培根|Francis 培根]]和其他文艺复兴时期作家called them "Gallo-Graeci,"和country "Gallo-Graecia".

加拉太人的源头是侵入[[马其顿|马其顿]]的克尔特移民的一部分, led by the 'second' {{tsl|en|Brennus||Brennus}}, a Gaulish chief. He invaded Greece in [[前281年|281 BCE]] with a huge warband and was turned back in the nick of time from plundering the temple of Apollo at Delphi.同时，another Gaulish group were migrating with their women and children through Thrace. They had split off from Brennus' Gauls in [[前279年|279 BCE]], and had migrated into Thrace under their leaders Leonnorius and Lutarius. These Gaulish invaders appeared in Asia Minor in [[前278年|278]]–[[前277年|277 BCE]]; others invaded 马其顿, killed the [[托勒密王朝|Ptolemaic]] king [[托勒密·克勞諾斯|Ptolemy Ceraunus]] but were eventually ousted by [[安提柯二世|Antigonus Gonatas]], the grandson of the defeated [[繼業者|diadoch]] [[安提柯一世|Antigonus the One-Eyed]].-->
 <!--As so often happens in cases of invasion, the invaders came at the express invitation of [[尼科美德一世|Nicomedes I]] of Bithynia, who required help in a dynastic struggle against his brother. Three tribes of Gauls crossed over from Thrace to Asia Minor. They numbered about 10,000 fighting men and about the same number of women and children, divided into three tribes, Trocmi, Tolistobogii and Tectosages. They were eventually defeated by the [[塞琉古帝国|Seleucid]] king [[安条克一世|Antiochus I]], in a battle where the Seleucid war elephants shocked the Celts. While breaking the momentum of the invasion, the Galatians were by no means exterminated.

Instead, the migration led to the establishment of a long-lived Gaulish territory in central [[安那托利亞|Anatolia]], which included the eastern part of ancient [[弗里吉亚|Phrygia]], a territory that became known as '''加拉太'''. There they ultimately settled, and being strengthened by fresh accessions of the same clan from Europe, they overran Bithynia, and supported themselves by plundering neighbouring countries.-->

<!--The constitution of 加拉太state is described by [[斯特拉波|Strabo]]: conformably to Gaulish custom, each tribe was divided into cantons, each governed by a chief ('tetrarch') of its own with a judge under him, whose powers were unlimited except in cases of murder, which were tried before a council of 300 drawn from the twelve cantons and meeting at a holy place, twenty miles southwest of Ancyra, which was likely to have been a sacred oak grove, for it was called 'Drynemeton' the "temple of the oaks" ''drys'' + ''nemed'' "temple". The local population of Cappadocians were left in control of the towns and most of the land, paying tithes to their new overlords, who formed a military aristocracy and kept aloof in fortified farmsteads, surrounded by their bands. -->

<!--高卢人 were great warriors, respected by 希腊人和罗马人 (''illustration, right''). They hired themselves out as mercenary soldiers,sometimes fighting on both sides in the great battles of the times. For years the Gaulish chieftains and their warbands ravaged 小亚细亚西半部分, as allies of one or other of the warring princes, without any serious check, until they sided with the renegade Seleucid prince [[安條克·伊厄拉斯|Antiochus Hierax]], who reigned in [[小亚细亚|小亚细亚]]. Hierax tried to defeat king [[阿塔罗斯一世|Attalus I of Pergamum]] ([[前241年|241]]–[[前197年|197 BCE]]), but instead, the hellenised cities united under his banner, and his armies inflicted several severe defeats upon them, about 232 forcing them to settle permanently and to confine themselves to the region to which they had already given their name.  The theme of the ''Dying Gaul'' (a famous statue displayed in Pergamon) remained a favorite in Hellenistic art for a generation. Their right to the district was formally recognized. The three Gaulish tribes were settled where they afterwards remained, the Tectosages round Ancyra, the Tolistobogii round [[培希努|Pessinus]], sacred to [[库柏勒|Cybele]], and the Trocmi round Tavium.-->

<!--But the power of the Gauls was not yet broken. The Pergamene king himself soon employed their services in the increasingly devastating wars of 小亚细亚; another band deserted from their Egyptian overlord [[托勒密四世|Ptolemy IV]] after a [[日食|solar eclipse]] had broken their spirits.

前2世纪初 they proved terrible allies of [[安条克三世|Antiochus the Great]], the last Seleucid king trying to regain suzerainity over Asia Minor, but after the defeat of the Seleucid king to the Romans, Rome at last proved a worthy protection against them. In [[前189年|189 BCE]] an expedition was sent against them under Ca. Manlius Vulso, who defeated them. Henceforward their military power declined and they fell at times under {{tsl|en|Pontus||Pontic}} ascendancy, from which they were finally freed by the {{tsl|en|Mithridatic Wars||Mithridatic Wars}}, in which they heartily supported Rome.-->
 
<!--In the settlement of 前64年加拉太 became a client-state of the empire, the old constitution disappeared, and three chiefs (wrongly styled “tetrarchs “) were appointed, one for each tribe. But this arrangement soon gave way before the ambition of one of these tetrarchs, {{tsl|en|Deiotarus||Deiotarus}}, the contemporary of Cicero and Caesar, who made himself master of the other two tetrarchies and was finally recognized by the Romans as 加拉太'king'. On the death of the third king Amyntas in [[前25年|25 BCE]], however,加拉太 was incorporated by Augustus in [[罗马帝国|罗马帝国]], though near his capital Ancyra ([[安卡拉|安卡拉]]) Pylamenes, the king's heir, rebuilt a temple of the Phrygian goddess [[男性|Men]] to venerate Augustus, as a sign of fidelity.  It was in a temple carving in 加拉太 that the major source for {{tsl|en|Res Gestae||Res Gestae}} of Augustus were preserved for modernity.  Few of the provinces proved more enthusiastically loyal to Rome.加拉太人 also practiced a form of Romano-Celtic polytheism, common in Celtic lands.-->

<!--at Lystra the multitude could scarcely be restrained from sacrificing to 保罗(because they assumed he was a god);不久之后他们向他扔石头and left him for dead. Crescens was sent thither by Paul toward the close of his life (''提后'' 4:10).-->

<!--[[弗拉維奧·約瑟夫斯|Josephus]] related the biblical figure {{tsl|en|Gomer (Ezekiel)||Gomer}} to 加拉太. "For Gomer founded those whom 希腊人 now call 加拉太人, [Galls,] but were then called Gomerites." {{tsl|en|Antiquities of the Jews||Antiquities of the Jews}}, I:6.尽管其他人 have related Gomer to [[辛梅里亚人|Cimmerians]].

加拉太人还说[[克尔特语族|克尔特语族]]的[[加拉太语|加拉太语]] in the time of Jerome ([[347年|347]]–[[420年|420 CE]]), who wrote that the Galatians of [[安卡拉|Ancyra]] and the [[特雷維里人|Treveri]] of [[特里尔|Trier]] (in what is now [[德国|German]] [[莱茵兰|Rhineland]]) spoke the same [[高盧語|language]]. The final fate of 加拉太人 is a subject of some uncertainty, but they seem ultimately to have been absorbed into [[希腊语|希腊语]]- and/or [[土耳其语|土耳其语]]-speaking populations of west-central Anatolia.-->
