〈'''刪除全宇宙'''〉（{{lang-en|''A Glitch Is a Glitch''}}）是《[[探險活寶|探險活寶]]》[[探險活寶_(第五季)|第五季]]的第15集。在[[卡通頻道|卡通頻道]]2013年4月1日播出。本集 (探險活寶第四季)為主角。在這一集裡，[[冰霸王|冰霸王]]作了一個電腦病毒，除了他和[[泡泡糖公主|泡泡糖公主]]刪除哇賽祕境一切。阿寶和老皮要在刪除宇宙之前移除病毒。

<!--==劇情==
As Finn and Jake are drawing a picture of Ice King on their computer, a brick with a [[floppy_disk|floppy disk]] taped to it flies in through their window. When they try to read the disk, they find a disturbing video of a woman eating her own hair. Jake tries to exit the video, but it produces a glitch that materializes outside the computer and begins to destroy their treehouse.

Meanwhile, in the Candy Kingdom, the Ice King appears and discusses with Princess Bubblegum a purported statement she made about going on a date with him if he was the last person in Ooo. Finn and Jake arrive and Ice King tells them that he created the virus so that, indeed, he will be the last person around, which will force Bubblegum to go on a date with him. Finn and Jake attempt to save the Candy People, but are dismayed when they keep being "deleted". Finn manages to enter the "Universal Source Code" by breaking a hole in the virus' body. They find the virus, a grotesque digital likeness of Ice King's head, eating pieces of source code, which in turn deletes reality. Before they can reach the virus, Jake's and Finn's limbs are deleted. Meanwhile, Princess Bubblegum attempts to force Ice King to relinquish the anti-virus, only for him to reveal he did not make one.

Back in the Source Code, Finn attempts to slice open the virus but it eats his sword. When all seems lost, Jake remembers the video Ice King sent at the start of the episode, and both he and Finn start eating Finn's hair. Disgusted, the virus regurgitates all the chunks of code it consumed and is ejected from the Source Code. Everything returns to normal back on Ooo, and Ice King becomes trapped in a reappearing house wall. Princess Bubblegum then destroys Ice King's computer.

==Production==
[[File:Moiré_grid.svg|thumb]] to visually present the idea of traveling through a "time tunnel".]]
"A Glitch Is a Glitch" was written, storyboarded, directed, and animated by Irish filmmaker and artist [[David_OReilly_(artist)|David OReilly]]. [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], the show's creator, was a fan of OReilly's short films and had contacted him in early 2010 about the possibility of OReilly directing an episode of the series. At the time OReilly, was busy making ''The External World'', and he was forced to tell Ward that, due to his obligations, he would be unable to collaborate at the time. About a year later OReilly had moved to [[Los_Angeles|Los Angeles]] and they ran into each other a few times and started talking about the idea again. Reportedly, Ward allowed OReilly to have complete creative control over the episode, stipulating that OReilly was allowed to "do [his] own thing".<ref name=oreillyinterview/> OReilly later noted that he would have been happy to have animated one of show's regular episodes, but he was extremely pleased that Ward gave him complete control over the episode, noting that, "It may be the only animated show in history to let a total outsider write and direct an episode." The final product had to be slightly modified, and some jokes had to be cut or edited, but OReilly explained that the finished product was still something he is proud of.<ref name=oreillyinterview/>

The initial video seen in the episode that gives the Land of Ooo a virus—featuring a girl eating her own hair—was created by OReilly and then released a few weeks before the episode aired. OReilly explained that he was trying to emulate [[shock_site|shock site]]s like [[tubgirl|tubgirl]] or [[Goatse.cx|Goatse.cx]]. OReilly later said that some complained that the scene was "too extreme for kids' TV", but he argued that children were capable of tolerating it. OReilly found that mixing his trademark glitch style with good character animation was difficult, and presented a lot of technical hurdles. In particular, he found a scene in the end, wherein an earlier clip is superimposed above Finn and Jake to function almost as a thought bubble, to be easy to storyboard, but difficult to animate. To create the titular glitches, OReilly generated [[Sprite_(computer_graphics)|sprite]]s inside of objects that produced random pixels which moved outwards to create colorful blotches. Some other glitch effects were created via jpeg corruption and [[datamosh|datamosh]]ing. OReilly also used [[moire_pattern|moire pattern]]s for the "time tunnel" sequence. All of these effects were then processed through compositing software, in an effect, controlling the glitches.<ref name=oreillyinterview/>

Music producer Steven Ellison, better known as [[Flying_Lotus|Flying Lotus]] composed the music featured at the end of the episode. There were originally plans for OReilly to craft a completely different intro that Flying Lotus would score, so he sent over some tracks during production. In the end, the series did not have the time or money to recraft the intro, so the end credits sequence was created in its stead.<ref name=oreillyinterview>{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2013/apr/25/datamoshing-land-ooo-conversation-david-oreilly/|title=Datamoshing the Land of Ooo |last1=Rourke|first1=Daniel|last2=OReilly|first2=David|date=April 25, 2013|website=Rhizome|accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref>

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.
