'''羞恥徽章'''（{{lang-en|Badge of shame}}）通常指以公开羞辱、排斥、迫害为目的，要求特定的团体或个人佩戴的某种符号。

例如在英国，根据1697年的济贫法，领取教区救济的贫民在公开场合时于被要求在右手袖子上佩戴蓝色或红色布制成的徽章，以示其生活为羞辱。<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/324/1/WRAP_Hindle_Dependency_Shame_Belonging_Final_Version.pdf|title=Dependency, Shame and Belonging: Badging the Deserving Poor, c.1550-1750*.|accessdate=2013-11-10|archive-date=2013-11-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110103504/http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/324/1/WRAP_Hindle_Dependency_Shame_Belonging_Final_Version.pdf|dead-url=no}}</ref>另一个著名的例子是[[中世纪|中世纪]]欧洲一些国家的犹太人被迫佩戴黄色[[犹太星|犹太星]]徽章，<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishhistory.org.il/history.php?startyear=1250&endyear=1259 |title=Jewish History 1250–1259 : 1257 Badge OF Shame (Italy) |accessdate=2007-11-06 |work=The History of the Jewish People |publisher=Jewish Agency |quote=…the badge of shame was imposed locally and infrequently in Italy until the Bull of Pope Alexander IV enforced it on all papal states. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103060933/http://jewishhistory.org.il/history.php?startyear=1250&endyear=1259 |archivedate=2007-11-03 |deadurl=yes }}</ref>[[纳粹德国|纳粹德国]]统治期间，在纳粹影响下的欧洲国家内的犹太人也被逼佩戴这种识别标记。<ref>{{cite book |author=D'Ancona, Jacob |title=The City Of Light |publisher=Citadel |location=New York |year= 2003 |pages= 23–24|isbn=0-8065-2463-4 |quote=But the wearing of a badge or outward sign — whose effect, intended or otherwise, successful or not, was to shame and to make vulnerable as well as to distinguish the wearer…}}</ref>该词语也用来指代其它与羞辱有关的符号。《[[圣经|圣经]]》中[[耶和华|耶和华]]给[[该隐|该隐]]立的记号（'''mark of Cain'''）有作为羞辱的代名词的解释。<ref name="isbn0-87779-628-9">{{cite book |author=Feinsilber, Mike; Webber, Elizabeth |title=Merriam-Webster's dictionary of allusions |publisher=Merriam-Webster |location=Springfield, Mass |year=1999 |pages= 95|isbn=0-87779-628-9 |quote=As the term [mark of Cain] is used today, the idea of a protective mark has been lost; only the negative sense of a mark of shame or criminality remains.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=R.
