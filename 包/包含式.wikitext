'''包含式'''（clusivity）在[[語言學|語言學]]上是指介於包容性與排除'的[[人称|第一人稱]][[代詞|代詞]]及[[动词|动词]]之間的語法區分，亦稱為包容性的"我們"及排除性的"我們"。包容性的"我們"具體包括"談話的對象"（addressee）（即為、"我們"表示出"你和我"），而排除性的"我們"明確地排除"談話的對象"(即為、"我們"表示出"他/她/他們"及我，但不包括"你")，不管可能涉及任何其他人。同時想像這種區分卻可以在其他人稱(特別是第二人稱)直接表現出，事實上第二人稱包含式的存在(你、你們及他們)在自然語言是有爭議的，並沒有得到很好的證明。<ref name="simon2005">Simon, Horst J.

第一人稱包含式在[[达罗毗荼语系|达罗毗荼语系]]、[[澳大利亚原住民语言|澳大利亚原住民语言]]，及[[南島語系|南島語系]]中是一個共同的特點，而且還發現存在[[東亞|東亞]]、[[南亞|南亞]]、[[西南亞|西南亞]]、[[美洲|美洲]]的語言，及在一些[[克里奧爾語|克里奧爾語]]裡。[[閩南語語法|閩南語語法]]也有這種區別，分別用「咱」和「阮」兩個不同的代詞表示。一些非洲語言也有這種區別，比如[[富拉語|富拉語]]。[[高加索|高加索]]以外的任何歐洲語系沒有這種語法的區分，但某些結構上可能在[[语义学|语义学]]上存有包含式或排除式等內涵。

==形態學==
在某些語言裡，這三個第一人稱代詞看來無關。<!--This is the case for [[Chechen_language|Chechen]], which has singular ''so,'' exclusive ''txo,'' and inclusive ''vai.'' In others, all three are related, as in [[Tok_Pisin|Tok Pisin]] (a pidgin English spoken in Papua/New Guinea) singular ''mi,'' exclusive ''mi-pela,'' and inclusive ''yu-mi'' (a compound of ''mi'' with ''yu'' "you") or ''yu-mi-pela.'' However, when only one of the plural pronouns is related to the singular, it may be either one. In some dialects of [[Mandarin_Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], for example, inclusive or exclusive ''wǒmen'' is the plural form of singular ''wǒ'' "I", while inclusive ''zánmen'' is a separate root. However, in [[Hadza_language|Hadza]] it is the inclusive, ''’one-be’e,'' which is the plural of the singular ''’ono'' (''’one-'') "I", while the exclusive ''’oo-be’e'' is a separate root.

It is not uncommon for two separate words for "I" to pluralize into derived forms having a clusivity distinction.  For example, in [[Vietnamese_language|Vietnamese]] the familiar word for "I" (''ta'') pluralizes to inclusive we (''chúng ta'') and the polite word for "I" (''tôi'') pluralizes into exclusive we (''chúng tôi'').  In [[Samoan_language|Samoan]], the singular form of the exclusive pronoun is the regular word for "I", while the singular form of the inclusive pronoun may also occur on its own, in which case it also means "I", but with a connotation of appealing or asking for indulgence.

In the [[Kunama_language|Kunama language]] of [[Languages_of_Eritrea|Eritrea]], the first person inclusive and exclusive distinction is marked on [[Dual_(grammatical_number)|dual]] and plural forms of verbs, independent pronouns, and possessive pronouns.<ref>Thompson, E. D. 1983. "Kunama: phonology and noun phrase" in [[Lionel_Bender_(linguist)|M. Lionel Bender]] (ed.): ''Nilo-Saharan Language Studies'', pp. 280–322. East Lansing: African Studies Center, Michigan State University.</ref>-->

==動詞區別==
<!--Where verbs are inflected for [[grammatical_person|person]], as in Australia and much of America, the inclusive-exclusive distinction can be made there as well.-->例如，在[[馬拉賽-帕薩馬闊地語|馬拉賽-帕薩馬闊地語]](Malecite-Passamaquoddy language)"我/我們有它(I/we have it)"表示：
:Singular '''''n'''-tíhin'' (第1人稱前綴 ''n-)''
:Exclusive '''''n'''-tíhin-'''èn''''' (第1人稱 ''n-'' + 複數後綴 ''-èn)''
:Inclusive '''''k'''-tíhin-'''èn''''' (排除式前綴 ''k-'' + 複數 ''-èn)''
<!--
In Tamil on the other hand, the two different pronouns have the same agreement on the verb.-->

==單數包含形式==<!--
Several [[Polynesian_languages|Polynesian languages]], such as [[Samoan_language|Samoan]] and [[Tongan_language|Tongan]], have clusivity with overt dual and plural suffixes in their pronouns. The lack of a suffix indicates the singular. The exclusive form is used in the singular as the normal word for "I", but the inclusive also occurs in the singular. The distinction is one of [[discourse_(linguistics)|discourse]]: the singular inclusive has been described as the "modesty I" in Tongan, often rendered in English as ''one'', while in Samoan its use has been described as indicating emotional involvement on the part of the speaker.-->

==第二人稱包含式==<!--
In theory, clusivity of the second person should be a possible distinction, but its existence is controversial.  Some notable linguists, such as [[Bernard_Comrie|Bernard Comrie]],<ref>Comrie, Bernard. 1980.  "Review of Greenberg, Joseph H. (ed.), ''Universals of human language, Volume 3: Word Structure (1978)''".  ''Language'' 56: p837, as quoted in Simon 2005.  Quote: ''One pair of combinations not discussed is the opposition between 2nd person non-singular inclusive (i.e. including some third person) and exclusive, which is attested in Southeast Ambrym.''</ref> have attested that the distinction is extant in spoken natural languages, while others, such as [[John_Henderson_(linguist)|John Henderson]],<ref>Henderson, T.S.T. 1985. "Who are ''we'', anyway? A study of personal pronoun systems". ''Linguistische Berichte'' 98: p308, as quoted in Simon 2005.  Quote: ''My contention is that any language which provided more than one 2nd person plural pronoun, and required the speaker to make substantial enquiries about the whereabouts and number of those referred to in addition to the one person he was actually addressing, would be quite literally unspeakable.''</ref> maintain that the human brain does not have the capacity to make a clusivity distinction in the second person.  Many other linguists take the more neutral position that it could exist but is nonetheless not currently attested.<ref name="simon2005"/>

Clusivity in the second person is conceptually simple but nonetheless if it exists is extremely rare, unlike clusivity in the first.  Hypothetical second-person clusivity would be the distinction between "you and you (and you and you ... all present)" and "you and someone else whom I am not addressing currently."  These are often referred to in the literature as "2+2" and "2+3", respectively (the numbers referring to second and third person as appropriate).  Horst J. Simon provides a deep analysis of second-person clusivity in his 2005 article.<ref name="simon2005"/>  He concludes that oft-repeated rumors regarding the existence of second-person clusivity—or indeed, any [+3] pronoun feature beyond simple exclusive we<ref>One treated example is the Ghomala' language of Western Cameroon, which has been said to have a [1+2+3] first-person plural pronoun, but a more recent analysis by Wiesemann (2003) indicates that such pronouns may be limited to ceremonial use.</ref> – are ill-founded, and based on erroneous analysis of the data.-->

The inclusive–exclusive distinction is nearly universal among the [[Austronesian_languages|Austronesian languages]] and the languages of northern [[Australian_Aboriginal_languages|Australia]], but rare in the nearby [[Papuan_languages|Papuan languages]]. ([[Tok_Pisin|Tok Pisin]], an English-Melanesian [[pidgin|pidgin]], generally has the inclusive–exclusive distinction, but this varies with the speaker's language background.) It is widespread in India (among the [[Dravidian_languages|Dravidian]] and [[Munda_languages|Munda languages]], as well as in the [[Indo-European_languages|Indo-European languages]] of [[Marathi_language|Marathi]], [[Rajasthani_language|Rajasthani]], [[Sindhi_language|Sindhi]], and [[Gujarati_language|Gujarati]], which borrowed it from Dravidian), and the languages of eastern [[Siberia|Siberia]], such as [[Tungusic_languages|Tungusic]], from which it was borrowed into northern [[Mandarin_Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]. In [[Indigenous_languages_of_the_Americas|America]] it is found in about half the languages, with no clear geographic or genealogical pattern. It is also found in a few languages of the [[Caucasian_languages|Caucasus]] and [[African_languages|Sub-Saharan Africa]], such as [[Fula_language|Fulani]] and [[Nama_language|Nama]].<ref>http://wals.info/chapter/39 [[World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures|World Atlas of Language Structures]] 39: Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Independent Pronouns</ref><ref>http://wals.info/chapter/40 [[World_Atlas_of_Language_Structures|World Atlas of Language Structures]] 40: Inclusive/Exclusive Distinction in Verbal Inflection</ref>

It is, of course, possible in any language to express the idea of clusivity semantically, and many languages provide common forms that clarify the ambiguity of their first person pronoun (English ''the rest of us'' or Italian ''noialtri''). A language with a true clusivity distinction, however, does not provide a first person plural with ''indefinite'' clusivity: where the clusivity of the pronoun is ambiguous; rather, the speaker is forced to specify by choice of pronoun or inflection whether he is including the addressee or not. This rules out most European languages, for example. Clusivity is nonetheless a very common language feature overall. Some languages with more than one plural number make the clusivity distinction only in, for example, the dual, but not in the greater plural. Others will make it in all numbers. In the table below, the plural forms are the ones preferentially listed.
