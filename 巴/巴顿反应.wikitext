==亚硝酸烷基酯的制备==

{{TransH}}
The unusual alkyl nitrite starting material of the Barton reaction is prepared by attack of an alcohol on a nitrosylium cation generated in situ by dehydration of doubly protonated nitrous acid.<ref name = "Noyes OrgSyn 1936">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.016.0007| title = N-Butyl Nitrite| journal = Organic Syntheses| volume = 16| pages = 7| year = 1936}}</ref> This series of steps is mechanistically identical to the first half of the mechanism formation of the more well-known aryl and alkyl [[diazonium_salts|diazonium salts]].

While the synthesis of alkyl nitrites from [[nitrosyl_chloride|nitrosyl chloride]] is known and oft-employed in the context of complex molecule synthesis, the reaction is reversible and the products are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the starting material. Furthermore, nitrosyl chloride is a powerful oxidizing agent, and oxidation of the alcohols with concomitant chlorination has been observed.<ref name="Beckam CR 1951">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr60151a001| title = Nitrosyl Chloride| journal = Chemical Reviews| volume = 48| issue = 3| pages = 319–396| year = 1951| last1 = Beckham | first1 = L.

The Barton reaction commences with a photochemically induced cleavage of the nitrite O-N bond, typically using a high pressure mercury lamp.<ref name="Sugimoto Tet 2008">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tet.2008.12.063| title = Microflow photo-radical reaction using a compact light source: Application to the Barton reaction leading to a key intermediate for myriceric acid A| journal = Tetrahedron| volume = 65| issue = 8| pages = 1593–1598| year = 2009| last1 = Sugimoto | first1 = A. | last2 = Fukuyama | first2 = T. | last3 = Sumino | first3 = Y. | last4 = Takagi | first4 = M. | last5 = Ryu | first5 = I. }}</ref> This produces an alkyoxyl radical which immediately abstracts a hydrogen atom from the δ-carbon. In the absence of other radical sources or other proximal reactive groups, the alkyl radical recombines with the nitrosyl radical. The resultant nitroso compounds undergoes [[tautomerization|tautomerization]] to the isolated oxime product.

The carbon centered radical can be intercepted by other radical sources such as iodine or [[acrylonitrile|acrylonitrile]]. The first instance results in the δ-hydrogen being replaced with iodine, then subsequent [[cyclization|cyclization]] to a [[tetrahydrofuran|tetrahydrofuran]] by an [[SN2_reaction|SN2 reaction]].<ref name="Barton JACS 1965" /> The second example results in a chain elongation product with the oxime formed 2 carbon units further from the oxygen than normal.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Petrovic|first1=G.|last2=Cekovic|first2=Z.|date=1997|title=Free radical alkylation of the remote nonactivated δ-carbon atom|journal=Tetrahedron Lett.|volume=38|issue=4|pages=627–630|doi=10.1016/s0040-4039(96)02357-x}}</ref>

In rare cases, it appears that the alkoxyl radical may epimerize before hydrogen atom abstraction.<ref name = "Nickon JOC 1961">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo01067a671| title = Communications- Epimerization in a Nitrite Ester Photolysis| journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry| volume = 26| issue = 9| pages = 3617–3618| year = 1961| last1 = Nickson | first1 = A. | last2 = Mahajan | first2 = J. | last3 = McGuire | first3 = F. }}</ref>

Most commonly, including steroidal systems, the hydrogen atom is abstracted from a methyl group that has a 1,3 diaxial relationship with the alkoxyl radical.<ref name = "Cekovic CR 2003">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4020(03)01202-X| title = Reactions of δ-carbon radicals generated by 1,5-hydrogen transfer to alkoxyl radicals| journal = Tetrahedron| volume = 59| issue = 41| pages = 8073–8090| year = 2003| last1 = Čeković | first1 = Ž. }}</ref> In the absence of a hydrogen on the δ-carbon, or when the particular conformation of the substrate orients the ε-carbon close together, 1,6-hydrogen atom transfer is the favored process. However, these reactions tend to be an order of magnitude slower than the corresponding 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer.

Computational studies have shown that this preference for 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer over 1,6-hydrogen atom transfer appears to be entropically favored rather than a result of a particular stable ‘chair-like’ transition state.<ref name= "Houk JACS 1990">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00177a009| title = Transition structures for hydrogen atom transfers to oxygen.

In acyclic systems, δ-hydrogen abstraction is still observed, however, alpha-hydrogen abstraction to form the corresponding ketone competes.<ref name = "Ishumarov CNP 2005">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10600-006-0003-z| title = Ozonolysis of Ricinolic Acid Derivatives and Transformations of the Ozonolysis Products under Barton Reaction Conditions| journal = Chemistry of Natural Compounds| volume = 41| issue = 6| pages = 643–649| year = 2005| last1 = Ishmuratov | first1 = G.

In certain cases, particularly nitrites derived from cyclopentyl alcohols, the oxygen-centered radical prefers to react via C-C bond cleavage as opposed to H-atom abstraction.<ref name = "Barton JACS 1965">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00948a036| title = Some Radical Exchange Reactions during Nitrite Ester Photolysis1| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 87| issue = 20| pages = 4601–4607| year = 1965| last1 = Akhtar | first1 = M.| last2 = Barton | first2 = D.

In rigid systems such as aldosterone, the 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer is exceedingly fast, with a rate constant on the order of 10^7 s-1.

For the formation of a primary, second, or tertiary alkyl radical from an alkoxyl radical, there is a driving force of 3 kcal/mol, 5 kcal/mol, and 9 kcal/mol, respectively.<ref name="Cekovic CR 2003"/>

The alkyl radical formed after hydrogen atom transfer is susceptible to standard radical reactions when scavengers are present in sufficient excess to outcompete the nitrosyl radical. Soon after their initial disclosure, Barton and co-workers reported the trapping of the radical with I<sub>2</sub> and CCl<sub>3</sub>Br (as Iodine and Bromine radical sources, respectively) to form the δ-halo-alcohol. These halohydrin species can be cyclized to the corresponding [[tetrahydropyran|tetrahydropyran]] derivates under basic conditions.<ref name = "Barton JACS 1964">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01070a039| title = Radical Exchange during Nitrite Photolysis| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 86| issue = 16| pages = 3394–3395| year = 1964| last1 = Akhtar | first1 = M.| last2 = Barton | first2 = D.

Large excesses of activated alkenes can be used to intercept the alkyl radical and results in formation of a C-C bond from an unactivated C-H bond.<ref name= "Petrovic TL 1999">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4020(98)01110-7| title = Alkylation of remote non-activated δ-carbon atoms: Addition of δ-carbon radicals, generated by 1,5-hydrogen transfer in alkoxy radical intermediates, to activated olefins| journal = Tetrahedron| volume = 55| issue = 5| pages = 1377–1390| year = 1999| last1 = Petrović | first1 = G. | last2 = Čeković | first2 = Ž. }}</ref>

In the presence of [[oxygen|oxygen]], the alkyl radical is trapped and forms an organic peroxy radical. This intermediate is trapped by the nitrosyl radical and then isomerizes to give a δ-nitrate ester which, while both acid- and base-stable, can be reduced to the corresponding alcohol under mild conditions.<ref name="Barton JCSPT 1973">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/P19730002402| title = Nitrite photolysis in the presence of oxygen.
