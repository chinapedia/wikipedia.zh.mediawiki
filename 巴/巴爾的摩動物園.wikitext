==歷史==
巴爾的摩動物園於1876年開幕，一般認為是美國歷史第三悠久的動物園。

2004年動物園發生財務危機，被迫關閉部分展場。<ref>{{cite news|date=July 9, 2004|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/news/3510222/detail.html|title=Baltimore Zoo No More; Additional Changes Coming|work=WBAL Baltimore|publisher=Wbaltv.com|accessdate=March 17, 2011|archive-date=2012-03-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315222428/http://www.wbaltv.com/news/3510222/detail.html|dead-url=no}}</ref>關閉的部分包括過於老舊而無法提供動物適當環境的主谷（Main Valley）；爬蟲類館也關閉了。爬蟲類、長臂猿以及雪豹則貸與其他動物園與水族館。

2008年巴爾的摩動物園獲選為該年美國最佳動物園。

巴爾的摩動物園積極參與許多保育活動，重要者包括山區大猩猩醫療計畫（Mountain Gorilla Veterinary Program）以及金蛙計畫（Project Golden Frog）。該園也是養育最多非洲[[黑腳企鵝|黑腳企鵝]]的動物園。此外該園並協助復育本地的野生動物，尤其是例如白頭海鵰等猛禽。
