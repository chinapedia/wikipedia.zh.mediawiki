==亚硝酸烷基酯的制备==

The unusual 亚硝酸烷基酯starting material of the Barton reaction is prepared by attack of an alcohol on a nitrosylium cation generated in situ by dehydration of doubly protonated nitrous acid.<ref name = "Noyes OrgSyn 1936">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.15227/orgsyn.016.0007| title = N-Butyl Nitrite| journal = Organic Syntheses| volume = 16| pages = 7| year = 1936}}</ref> This series of steps is mechanistically identical to the first half of the mechanism formation of the more well-known aryl and alkyl [[重氮盐|重氮盐]].

While the synthesis of alkyl nitrites from [[亚硝酰氯|亚硝酰氯]] is known and oft-employed in the context of complex molecule synthesis, the reaction is reversible and the products are in thermodynamic equilibrium with the starting material. Furthermore, nitrosyl chloride is a powerful oxidizing agent, and oxidation of the alcohols with concomitant chlorination has been observed.<ref name="Beckam CR 1951">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cr60151a001| title = Nitrosyl Chloride| journal = Chemical Reviews| volume = 48| issue = 3| pages = 319–396| year = 1951| last1 = Beckham | first1 = L. J. | last2 = Fessler | first2 = W. A. | last3 = Kise | first3 = M. A. }}</ref> The reaction of nitrosyl chloride with aromatic alcohols generally yields nitroso compounds and other over-oxidation products.

==反应机理和区域选择性==

The Barton reaction commences with a photochemically induced cleavage of the nitrite O-N bond, typically using a high pressure mercury lamp.<ref name="Sugimoto Tet 2008">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tet.2008.12.063| title = Microflow photo-radical reaction using a compact light source: Application to the Barton reaction leading to a key intermediate for myriceric acid A| journal = Tetrahedron| volume = 65| issue = 8| pages = 1593–1598| year = 2009| last1 = Sugimoto | first1 = A. | last2 = Fukuyama | first2 = T. | last3 = Sumino | first3 = Y. | last4 = Takagi | first4 = M. | last5 = Ryu | first5 = I. }}</ref> This produces an alkyoxyl radical which immediately abstracts a hydrogen atom from the δ-carbon. In the absence of other radical sources or other proximal reactive groups, the alkyl radical recombines with the nitrosyl radical. The resultant nitroso compounds undergoes [[互变异构|互变异构]] to the isolated oxime product.
[[File:Barton_reaction_mechanism.svg|alt=]]

The carbon centered radical can be intercepted by other radical sources such as iodine or [[丙烯腈|丙烯腈]]. The first instance results in the δ-hydrogen being replaced with iodine, then subsequent [[环化|环化]] to a [[四氢呋喃|四氢呋喃]] by an [[SN2反应|SN2反应]].<ref name="Barton JACS 1965" /> The second example results in a chain elongation product with the oxime formed 2 carbon units further from the oxygen than normal.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Petrovic|first=G.|last2=Cekovic|first2=Z.|date=1997|title=Free radical alkylation of the remote nonactivated δ-carbon atom|url=|journal=Tetrahedron Lett.|volume=38|pages=627-630|via=}}</ref>

C. }}</ref> Isotopic labeling of the nitrite with 15N has shown the mechanism non-‘caged’ and that the nitrosyl radical formed from a given nitrite recombines randomly with other alkyl radicals. However, recombination of the nitrosyl radical with the alkoxyl radical (a reversal of the homolytic cleavage) has been shown to proceed without scrambling of isotope labels.<ref name="Akhtar JACS 1963">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01056a035| title = The Mechanism of the Barton Reaction| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 86| issue = 2| pages = 265–268| year = 1964| last1 = Akhtar | first1 = M.| last2 = Pechet | first2 = M.

In rare cases, it appears that the alkoxyl radical may epimerize before hydrogen atom abstraction.<ref name = "Nickon JOC 1961">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/jo01067a671| title = Communications- Epimerization in a Nitrite Ester Photolysis| journal = The Journal of Organic Chemistry| volume = 26| issue = 9| pages = 3617–3618| year = 1961| last1 = Nickson | first1 = A. | last2 = Mahajan | first2 = J. | last3 = McGuire | first3 = F. }}</ref>

Most commonIy, including steroidal systems, the hydrogen atom is abstracted from a methyl group that has a 1,3 diaxial relationship with the alkoxyl radical.<ref name = "Cekovic CR 2003">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4020(03)01202-X| title = Reactions of δ-carbon radicals generated by 1,5-hydrogen transfer to alkoxyl radicals| journal = Tetrahedron| volume = 59| issue = 41| pages = 8073–8090| year = 2003| last1 = Čeković | first1 = Ž. }}</ref> In the absence of a hydrogen on the δ-carbon, or when the particular conformation of the substrate orients the ε-carbon close together, 1,6-hydrogen atom transfer is the favored process. However, these reactions tend to be an order of magnitude slower than the corresponding 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer.

Computational studies have shown that this preference for 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer over 1,6-hydrogen atom transfer appears to be entropically favored rather than a result of a particular stable ‘chair-like’ transition state.<ref name= "Houk JACS 1990">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00177a009| title = Transition structures for hydrogen atom transfers to oxygen.

In acyclic systems, δ-hydrogen abstraction is still observed, however, alpha-hydrogen abstraction to form the corresponding ketone competes.<ref name = "Ishumarov CNP 2005">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10600-006-0003-z| title = Ozonolysis of Ricinolic Acid Derivatives and Transformations of the Ozonolysis Products under Barton Reaction Conditions| journal = Chemistry of Natural Compounds| volume = 41| issue = 6| pages = 643–649| year = 2005| last1 = Ishmuratov | first1 = G.

In certain cases, particularly nitrites derived from cyclopentyl alcohols, the oxygen-centered radical prefers to react via C-C bond cleavage as opposed to H-atom abstraction.<ref name = "Barton JACS 1965">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja00948a036| title = Some Radical Exchange Reactions during Nitrite Ester Photolysis1| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 87| issue = 20| pages = 4601–4607| year = 1965| last1 = Akhtar | first1 = M.| last2 = Barton | first2 = D.

In rigid systems such as aldosterone, the 1,5-hydrogen atom transfer is exceedingly fast, with a rate constant on the order of 10^7 s-1. Similar intermolecular H-atom transfer can be up to 100 times slower.<ref name = "Robertson CSR 2000">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/b000705f| title = Radical translocation reactions in synthesis| journal = Chemical Society Reviews| volume = 30| issue = 2| pages = 94–103| year = 2001| last1 = Robertson | first1 = J. | last2 = Pillai | first2 = J. | last3 = Lush | first3 = R. K. }}</ref> Furthermore, the hydrogen atom transfer benefits from the formation of a stronger O-H bond at the expense of a weaker C-H bond. For the formation of a primary, second, or tertiary alkyl radical from an alkoxyl radical, there is a driving force of 3 kcal/mol, 5 kcal/mol, and 9 kcal/mol, respectively.<ref name="Cekovic CR 2003"/>

The alkyl radical formed after hydrogen atom transfer is susceptible to standard radical reactions when scavengers are present in sufficient excess to outcompete the nitrosyl radical. Soon after their initial disclosure, Barton and co-workers reported the trapping of the radical with I<sub>2</sub> and CCl<sub>3</sub>Br (as Iodine and Bromine radical sources, respectively) to form the δ-halo-alcohol. These halohydrin species can be cyclized to the corresponding [[四氢吡喃|四氢吡喃]] derivates under basic conditions.<ref name = "Barton JACS 1964">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja01070a039| title = Radical Exchange during Nitrite Photolysis| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 86| issue = 16| pages = 3394–3395| year = 1964| last1 = Akhtar | first1 = M.| last2 = Barton | first2 = D.

Large excesses of activated alkenes can be used to intercept the alkyl radical and results in formation of a C-C bond from an unactivated C-H bond.<ref name= "Petrovic TL 1999">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0040-4020(98)01110-7| title = Alkylation of remote non-activated δ-carbon atoms: Addition of δ-carbon radicals, generated by 1,5-hydrogen transfer in alkoxy radical intermediates, to activated olefins| journal = Tetrahedron| volume = 55| issue = 5| pages = 1377–1390| year = 1999| last1 = Petrović | first1 = G. | last2 = Čeković | first2 = Ž. }}</ref>

In the presence of [[oxygen|oxygen]], the alkyl radical is trapped and forms an organic peroxy radical. This intermiediate is trapped by the nitrosyl radical and then isomerizes to give a δ-nitrate ester which, while both acid- and base-stable, can be reduced to the corresponding alcohol under mild conditions.<ref name="Barton JCSPT 1973">{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/P19730002402| title = Nitrite photolysis in the presence of oxygen.
