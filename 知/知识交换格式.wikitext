'''知识交换格式'''（{{lang|en|'''Knowledge Interchange Format'''}}，[[缩写|缩写]]为 '''{{lang|en|KIF}}'''）是一种針對计算机的语言，用于在不同的[[计算机程序|计算机程序]]之间交换[[知识|知识]]。
<!-- 
:''KIF'' is also the [[IATA_code|IATA code]] for [[Kingfisher_Lake_Airport|Kingfisher Lake Airport]].''
 has declarative [[semantics|semantics]] (i.e. the meaning of expressions in the representation can be understood without appeal to an interpreter for manipulating those expressions); it is logically comprehensive (i.e. it provides for the expression of arbitrary sentences in the [[First-order_logic|first-order predicate calculus]]); it provides for the representation of knowledge about the representation of knowledge; it provides for the representation of [[Non-monotonic_logic|nonmonotonic]] reasoning rules; and it provides for the definition of objects, functions, and relations.

It was originally created by [[Michael_Genesereth|Michael Genesereth]] and others participating in the [[DARPA_knowledge_Sharing_Effort|DARPA knowledge Sharing Effort]].  There have been a number of versions of KIF.  

Although the original KIF group intended to submit to a formal [[standardization|standards]] body, that did not occur.  A later version called [[Common_Logic|Common Logic]] has since been developed for submission to [[ISO|ISO]] and has been approved and published. A variant called  SUO-KIF is the language in which the [[Suggested_Upper_Merged_Ontology|Suggested Upper Merged Ontology]] is written.
