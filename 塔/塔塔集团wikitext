<!-- ==历史==
Jamshedji Tata came from a [[塔塔家族|business family]] and made his fortune from cloth mills in the interior of Maharashtra. He was well travelled and went in for modern industry for India. He constructed a hotel in Bombay, the Taj Mahal Hotel, in 1903. It was the first large hotel in India, and it was rumoured to have been set up because established hotels of the time were owned by Europeans and did not allow locals. The Indian Hotels Company is a Tata group company that runs the [[Taj_Hotels|Taj]] brand of hotels.

[[Tata_Steel|TISCO]], now Tata Steel was established in 1907 to set up India's first iron and steel plant in [[Jamshedpur|Jamshedpur]] (Named after Tata's founder, Jamshedji Tata) which is often called Tatanagar for the company's significant presence. The plant started production in 1912.  It produces steel at one of the lowest costs in the world, assisted by the Group's ownership of its own raw materials ([[coal|coal]] and [[iron|iron]]), which means that its cost base is far lower than many rival steel producers. In 1910, Tata Hydro-Electric Power Supply Company was set up. In 1917, the Group entered the consumer goods industry with the [[Tata_Oil_Mill|Tata Oil Mill]] Company being established to make soaps, detergents and cooking oils. In 1932, [[Tata_Airlines|Tata Airlines]] was established. In 1939, [[Tata_Chemicals|Tata Chemicals]] was established. [[TELCO|TELCO]], now Tata Motors, was established in 1945 to manufacture locomotive and engineering products.

On [[January_30|January 30]], [[2007|2007]], [[Tata_Steel|Tata Steel]], part of [[India|India]]'s Tata Group, offered to purchase 100% stake in the Corus Group at 608 p. per share in an all cash deal, cumulatively valued at [[US_Dollars|USD]] 12.04 Billion. This deal was also the biggest acquisition by an Indian company.{{fact|date=March 2007}}

Tata surprised the [[credit_default_swap|credit default swap]] segment of the [[derivative_market|derivative market]]s by deciding to raise $6.17 billion of debt for the deal through a new subsidiary of Corus called "Tata Steel UK", rather than by raising the debt itself.  Tata's [[security_(finance)|security]] [[credit_rating|credit rating]] is [[investment_grade|investment grade]], whereas the new subsidiary may not be.  The higher risk associated with raising debt through a subsidiary with a lower credit rating prompted [[Fitch_Ratings|Fitch Ratings]] to downgrade its rating of the credit swap risks in the takeover to "negative".  Fitch also stated that Corus' responsibility for the debt may lead to Corus' own unsecured debt rating being downgraded.
