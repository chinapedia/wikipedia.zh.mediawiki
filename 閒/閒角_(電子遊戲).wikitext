'''閒角'''（英文：Mob、Mobile{{R|bartle-origin|shahromine|netgames|ywwr}}）、又稱'''嘍囉'''、'''路人甲'''、'''怪物'''（Monster）、'''小兵'''等，為一個[[電子遊戲術語|電子遊戲術語]]，指在[[電玩遊戲|電玩遊戲]]中會攻擊[[玩家|玩家]]的[[非玩家角色|非玩家角色]]（NPC），是遊戲[[敵人|敵人]]的一種。{{R|wi-mob}}{{R|bartle-origin|netgames}}{{R|shahromine|bartle-origin}}

== 遊戲中的功能 ==
一般而言，嘍囉的能力和等級都比[[頭目_(角色類型)|敵方頭目]]（Boss）來的低，玩家普遍可透過遊戲的[[隨機遇敵|隨機遇敵]]或[[計步遇敵|計步遇敵]]系統在普通地圖上遇到。玩家打倒怪物後可獲得[[經驗值|經驗值]]{{R|carton}}，以至隨機在怪物身上掉落的[[金錢|金錢]]{{R|bartle-money}}、[[道具|道具]]{{R|busey}}等。一般[[遊戲設計師|遊戲設計師]]會將經驗值和金錢的多寡以及道具的優劣設定為依該怪物的等級而定，通常愈高等級的怪物，打倒後所獲得的經驗值和金錢也愈多，道具的品質也愈優良。

 | quote = What's more of an issue is the presence in the virtual world of virtual creatures.  These are commonly known as ''mobiles''<sup>30</sup> (''mobs'' for short), and they represent the monsters and non-player characters who inhabit the virtual world. [...] <sup>30</sup>From ''MUD1'', "mobile objects."  I called them that because creatures moving in a controlled but unpredictable way are like the kind of "mobiles" that hang from ceilings.  Well, I was in kind of a hurry...

 | quote = One consequence of this is that quest rewards and mobile drops should be variable, too.  Who'd want to risk life and limb for 20,000 UOC if it wasn't enough to buy an arrow?  Yet how do designers make these price rises occur rationally in such a way that unscrupulous players can't screw over the system?

 | quote = One of the major types of objects that you will encounter on a Mud is the ''mobile''.  A ''mob'' (pronounced MOHb, not MAWb), or mobile, is a computer controlled creature. [...] If a mob is not friendly, it is known as an ''agg'' or ''aggressive'' mobile.  It will hit you at the first opportunity, even the instant you walk into a room.  A majority of Muds have ''dumb'' mobs.  A dumb mob will fight you until you kill it or flee from it.
