<!--==劇情==

While walking in the woods, Jake begins performing acrobatic moves. Finn attempts to follow, and eventually the two get trapped in a massive spider web. The owners of the web, two large spiders named Ed (voiced by [[Bobcat_Goldthwait|Bobcat Goldthwait]]) and Barb (voiced by [[Susie_Essman|Susie Essman]]) return, bickering amongst themselves. The argument turns towards Barb's difficulty spinning webs, and she runs away. While Ed wraps Jake in a [[cocoon|cocoon]], Finn tries to offer relationship advice to Ed; Finn tells the spider to get a by doc"> gift for his wife, and Ed runs off into the woods to find something.

With the spiders distracted, Finn and Jake try to escape from the web, but to no avail. Ed later returns with a flaming sword, which he presents to Barb. However, she gets angry, arguing that he picked the gift because he liked, not because she would like it. Angered, Ed cuts the web, releasing Finn and Jake; he claims that Barb is dependent on him for food, as she cannot spin her own webs due to some unknown dysfunction. Barb attacks Ed, noting that [[Spider_cannibalism|she will have to eat him instead]]. Finn tries to help, but is pinned to a wall by Barb, who suddenly beings to moan as if in pain. Just then, an enormous [[egg_sack|egg sack]] emerges from her [[epigyne|epigyne]]. The sack bursts, giving birth to thousands of tiny spiders, who proceed to bury Finn and Jake.

"Web Weirdos" was written and storyboarded by [[Ako_Castuera|Ako Castuera]] and [[Jesse_Moynihan|Jesse Moynihan]], from a story developed by series creator [[Pendleton_Ward|Pendleton Ward]], [[Patrick_McHale_(cartoonist)|Patrick McHale]], [[Kent_Osborne|Kent Osborne]], and Dick Grunert.<ref name=episodecredits>{{cite episode| title=Web Weirdos| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = [[Larry_Leichliter|Larry Leichliter]] (director); Ako Castuera & Jesse Moynihan (writers) | network = [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] |airdate=April 16, 2012| season = 4 | number = 3}}</ref> According to Ward, the original outline for the episode was "super-sitcomy" and "standard". Castuera and Moynihan, however, were able to transform it into something different.<ref name=wardweb/> Much of the material in the episode was inspired by experiences Moynihan had had at couples therapy with a former girlfriend. He noted that the episode, thus, was based on the idea that you have to have empathy for your partner.<ref name=jesseweb/>

The episode begins with Finn and Jake partaking in [[parkour|parkour]]. Castuera noted in the DVD commentary for the episode that this scene set the stage for her and Moynihan's storyboarding partnership; she enjoyed physical comedy, whereas he liked focusing on emotion.<ref name=akoweb>Castuera, Ako (Storyboard artist). 2014. "Web Weirdos" [Commentary track], ''Adventure Time'' Season Four [DVD], Los Angeles, CA: [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]].</ref> There was a minor controversy with the studio in regards to the sound of Barb's silk-spinner. Originally, it was planned for there to be a "gooier, fartier {{sic}} sound", but this was later cut and replaced with a more tame sound effect.<ref name=wardweb>Ward, Pendleton (Series creator). 2014.

==Reception==
"Web Weirdos" first aired on [[Cartoon_Network|Cartoon Network]] on April 16, 2012.

Oliver Sava of ''[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the episode an "A–", arguing that the episode's premise—telling the story of a deteriorating marriage through two unhappy spiders—is one of the main reasons that the show has achieved such massively successful cross-over appeal. Sava complimented the casting of Essman and Goldthwait, noting that the two "make a great pair, capturing the stakes of the couple’s fight without sacrificing the comedy of the situation."<ref name=avclubspiders>{{cite web|last1=Sava|first1=Oliver|title=Adventure Time: 'Web Weirdos'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/adventure-time-web-weirdos-72145|website=[[The_A.V._Club|The A.V.

Mike Lechevaillier of ''[[Slate_(magazine)|Slate]]'' magazine, in a review of the fourth season, argued that the episode "present[s] determinedly adult interrelations through the eyes of the inexperienced Finn".<ref name=season4slate/> Lechevaillier compared and contrasted the episode with the following episode "[[Dream_of_Love|Dream of Love]]", noting that both deal with relationships in different ways, "yet do so with such originality, humbleness, and poise that any viewer, from age six to 60, can find something to identify with."<ref name=season4slate>{{cite web|last=LeChevallier|first=Mike|title=Adventure Time: Season Four|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/review/adventure-time-season-four/328|work=[[Slate_(magazine)|Slate]]|publisher=[[The_Washington_Post_Company|The Washington Post Company]]|accessdate=January 26, 2013|date=May 13, 2012}}</ref>


Moynihan later expressed dissatisfaction with the resulting episode; he felt that, while he took creative risks with the episode, his efforts fell flat. In an online interview, he explained, "I think Ako's parts are funny, but everything I wrote in the episode played out in a way that I didn't expect. It's the one episode I've worked on that I really feel didn't do anything I intended."<ref name=jmoynsthread>{{cite web|last=Moynihan|first=Jesse|title=Jesse Moynihan – Post 635|url=https://landofooo.com/community/topic/3590-jesse-moynihan/page-32#entry186550|publisher=LandofOoo.com|accessdate=August 23, 2014|date=August 22, 2013}} Note: Information taken from [[Jesse_Moynihan|Jesse Moynihan]]'s [http://landofooo.com/community/topic/3590-jesse-moynihan/?p=160388 verified] account.</ref>-->
