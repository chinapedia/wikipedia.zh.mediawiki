== 生平 ==
波伊斯在家中排行老八，父親Reverend Charles Boys是路特蘭維因地區英國國教會教堂的副主教。波伊斯先後就讀莫尔伯勒中学與皇家矿业学院。在皇家矿业学院就讀期間，波伊斯向{{tsl|en|Frederick Guthrie||Frederick Guthrie}}學習物理，同時也自學了高等數學，最後以礦學與冶金學專業畢業。在皇家矿业学院就讀之時，波伊斯曾發明一種機械裝置(它稱為[[積分繪圖器|積分繪圖器]])用以繪出函數的積分。波伊斯曾在煤礦業工作過很短一陣子，後來他應{{tsl|en|Frederick Guthrie||Frederick Guthrie}}之聘，擔任了[[演示員|演示員]]。

<!-- == 實驗物理學 ==

波伊斯發明了熔融石英纖維扭力彈簧，這項發明能讓他測量極微小的力量。因這項發明，波伊斯終於被認可為一位科學家。
He made the fused quartz fibres for his instrument by attaching a quartz rod to a [[弩|弩]] quarrel, heating the rod to the point of melting, and firing the crossbow. By this means he produced fibre so thin that it could not be resolved with an optical microscope.<ref name="frs" />  He used this invention to build a [[辐射计|辐射计]] capable of responding to the light of a single candle more than one mile away, and used that device for [[天文學|天文學]] observations.  In 1895 he published a measurement of the [[万有引力常数|万有引力常数]] ''G'' that improved upon the accuracy achieved by [[亨利·卡文迪什|亨利·卡文迪什]].  Boys' method relied on the same theory as Cavendish's, but used two masses suspended at one height and two nearby masses suspended at a different height, to minimize the unwanted interaction between opposite masses.<ref name="Cavendish">{{cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/050330a0|pages=330–334|title=On the Newtonian Constant of Gravitation1|journal=Nature|volume=50|issue=1292|date=1894-08-02|language=En|accessdate=2018-04-02|doi=10.1038/050330a0}}</ref>

He was a critic of the solar design of {{tsl|en|Frank Shuman||Frank Shuman}}, so Shuman hired him, and together they patented a "[[:File:US_Patent_1240890.pdf|Sun-Boiler]]", which is similar to modern day {{tsl|en|parabolic trough||parabolic trough}} solar power plants.<ref>[https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/mragheb/www/NPRE%20498ES%20Energy%20Storage%20Systems/Solar%20Thermal%20Power%20and%20Energy%20Storage%20Historical%20Perspective.pdf Solar Thermal Power and Energy Storage Historical Perspective]</ref>


== 公共服務與教育事業 ==

In 1897 Boys became a {{tsl|en|Metropolitan Gas Act 1860||Metropolitan Gas Referee}}, charged with assessing a fair price for [[煤气|煤气]]. He initially worked on the replacement of the {{tsl|en|Candlepower||standard candle}}, used to determine the quality of the gas for lighting, by the {{tsl|en|Augustus George Vernon Harcourt||Harcourt pentane lamp}}. As heating grew to become the principal use of coal gas, Boys undertook fundamental work on [[量热法|量热法]] to measure and record the heat content of the gas, achieving a substantial increase in precision of measurement.  At this time the national gas bill for the United Kingdom was fifty million  [[英镑|英镑]], so a one-percent correction to the bill represented a very significant amount of money.<ref name="frs" />

Boys also worked on high-speed [[摄影|摄影]] of lightning and bullets in flight, and conducted public lectures on the properties of [[肥皂泡|肥皂泡]], which were gathered into the book ''Soap Bubbles: Their Colours and the Forces Which Mould Them'', a classic of scientific popularization.  The first edition of ''Soap Bubbles'' appeared in 1890 and the second in 1911; it has remained in print to this day.  The book deeply impressed [[法国|法国]] writer [[阿尔弗雷德·雅里|阿尔弗雷德·雅里]], who in 1898 wrote the absurdist novel ''{{tsl|en|Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician||Exploits and Opinions of Dr. Faustroll, Pataphysician}}'', in which the title character, who was born at the age of 63 and sails in a sieve, is described as a friend of C.V. Boys (''see also'' {{tsl|en|'Pataphysics||'Pataphysics}}).

== 榮譽 ==

Boys was an assistant professor at the {{tsl|en|Royal College of Science||Royal College of Science}} (now [[伦敦帝国学院|伦敦帝国学院]]) in [[南肯辛顿|南肯辛顿]] from 1889 to 1897, as well as an examiner at the [[倫敦大學|倫敦大學]]. In 1899 he presented the [[英国皇家科学院圣诞讲座|英国皇家科学院圣诞讲座]].  He was elected to the [[皇家学会|皇家学会]] in 1888<ref name="frs"/> and knighted in 1935.  He was awarded the [[皇家獎章|皇家獎章]] in 1896 and the {{tsl|en|Rumford Medal||Rumford Medal}} in 1924.  He was awarded the {{tsl|en|Elliott Cresson Medal||Elliott Cresson Medal}} in 1939.

== 私人生活 ==

1892年，波伊斯與[[Marion_Amelia_Pollock|Marion Amelia Pollock]]結婚。但[[Marion_Amelia_Pollock|Marion Amelia Pollock]]後來與劍橋數學家{{tsl|en|Andrew Forsyth||Andrew Forsyth}}有染 ，這個醜聞使得{{tsl|en|Andrew Forsyth||Andrew Forsyth}}不得不辭去在劍橋擔任的講席。波伊斯於1910年與[[Marion_Amelia_Pollock|Marion Amelia Pollock]]離婚，而[[Marion_Amelia_Pollock|Marion Amelia Pollock]]後來就正式嫁給{{tsl|en|Andrew Forsyth||Andrew Forsyth}}。
